AB  - Feral hogs (Sus scrofa) are invasive, ecosystem engineers and a novel disturbance to rare, fire-dependent, herbaceous wetland ecosystems in Florida, USA. Their feeding activity uproots vegetation, altering plant composition and continuity. Hog rooting can also create linked disturbance by ingesting vegetation critical for fire spread. Herbaceous communities are vulnerable to shrub encroachment when fire return intervals are increased. We examined the impact of hog rooting intensity (% uprooted vegetation) on the resilience of herbaceous, seepage wetland vegetation cover and composition and the effect of hog rooting on fire spread. We hypothesized that (1) vegetation cover and composition would reflect initial intensity of hog rooting and remain altered with and without additional rooting, and (2) reduction of foliar cover by feral hog rooting would reduce fire spread. Total foliar cover, functional group cover, richness, and cover of plant genera were estimated in plots subjected to three intensity levels of hog rooting then appraised inside and outside of exclosures for 7 years. Spatial data was collected to compare areas with and without damage from hogs to areas burned by prescribed fires from 2010-2013. Total foliar cover was reduced for 5 years with high intensity hog rooting compared to no-low intensity rooting. Cover of a keystone, bunchgrass species was reduced with high intensity hog rooting. With repeated rooting, total and graminoid foliar cover were reduced outside exclosures. Fire spread was significantly reduced in areas of hog rooting. These findings have broader implications for conservation of other fire-maintained herbaceous communities impacted by nonindigenous feral hogs.

AB  - Sustaining oak-dominated forests that support regionally important biodiversity in the Appalachian Mountains is a substantial challenge for land managers due to mesophication - a region-wide phenomenon in which forest composition shifts from oaks to shade tolerant, mesic species such as maples. To inform oak forest management that includes biodiversity preservation as a management objective, we established a two treatment factorial design experiment at two sites to determine the effects of prescribed fire and deer herbivory on tree regeneration and understory plant diversity in dry oak-dominated forests. Data were collected before and after treatments were applied. Prescribed burns altered species composition to favor fire-adapted species and deer exclosure fences protected woody and herbaceous species sensitive to deer browse at both sites, however the initial conditions in the forests profoundly influenced the effects of these treatments. Prescribed fires promoted oak seedlings over maple seedling where oak seedlings were well stocked. Conversely, burning favored maple seedlings to the detriment of oak seedlings in areas where chronic over-browsing resulted in a depauperate understory. Although fire reduced understory plant cover at both sites, overall understory species richness was not affected by burning. This suggests that prescribed fire did not have detrimental effects on forest understory diversity, although herbaceous species diversity was significantly reduced by burning the site with an initially depauperate understory. Fencing resulted in large increases in species richness and cover of understory plants, including more than doubling the cover of tree seedlings and the abundance of tall seedlings in fenced plots, as well as shifts in understory composition towards species sensitive to deer browse. The herbaceous layer in this study contained nearly 6 species for every one species found in the tree canopy, reaffirming the importance of the herbaceous layer in the biodiversity of Appalachian oak-dominated forests. These results provide guidance to managers of protected areas seeking to enhance oak regeneration while maintaining or promoting native plant diversity in the forest understory.

AB  - The increasing deer population and their expanding distribution have altered the diversity and biomass of the plant community in the northern hemisphere. Furthermore, anthropogenic disturbances such as nitrogen deposition and logging threaten plant diversity in many parts of the forests. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effects of deer on plant communities under nitrogen deposition and logging conditions to un-derstand and conserve plant diversity in forest ecosystems. We conducted a field experiment that controlled three levels of deer densities (exclosure: 0 deer/km2, low: 10 deer/km2, and high: 20 deer/km2) and four anthropo-genic disturbances (without anthropogenic disturbances [control], nitrogen addition, logging, and nitrogen addition and logging combined) in a cool temperate secondary forest in northern Japan for nine years. We surveyed the effects of deer density and anthropogenic disturbance treatments on species richness and vegetation cover of life forms (forbs, ferns, trees, graminoids, unpalatable species, vines, and shrubs) and all species of understory vascular plants. We estimated the constant effect (without the elapsed year) and the temporary effect (with the elapsed year) of deer density, anthropogenic disturbances, and their interactions on the species rich-ness, vegetation cover, and Simpson's index as separate parameters in full models and selected the best model. The high deer density negatively affected the species richness of some life forms and all species and accelerated these effects over time for all species. The vegetation covers of most of the life forms were negatively affected by high deer density, and the effect was reduced over time. In contrast, the exclosure negatively affected the species richness of some life forms and positively affected the vegetation cover of most of the life forms and all species. The effect on the cover accelerated over time. Nitrogen addition accelerated the negative effect of high deer density on the species richness of shrubs. On the other hand, logging reduced the negative effect of high deer density on the species richness of all species. The cover of unpalatable species in the high deer density site with logging was approximately nine times higher than that in the high deer density site without anthropogenic disturbances in the last surveyed year. The high deer density and logging decreased the Simpson's diversity index score. These results indicate that the effects of deer density, anthropogenic disturbances, and their interactions vary with time. These interactions must be considered to manage deer's effect on forest ecosystems.

AB  - Ecosystem structure and processes of coastal temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest are thought to be strongly influenced by herbivory primarily of Roosevelt elk (Cervus elaphus roosevelti) and secondarily of Columbian black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus). Two large (0.5-ha) exclosures were built in old-growth coniferous rainforest communities in Olympic National Park, Washington, during 1979 to study these effects. Cover of shrubs, ferns, herbs, and graminoids and numbers of tree seedlings were described over 36 yr. Results show a sequence following ungulate exclusion of early release of shrubs, ferns, and herbs followed by eventual dominance of shrubs as other vegetation layers become shaded. Short-term responses of individual species reflected functional traits related to ability to avoid or tolerate herbivory. Over the longer term, effects reflected changing competitive relationships among vegetation layers and other ecosystem dynamics such as the provision of fallen trees in the appropriate decay class to serve as establishment substrate for tree seedlings. In aggregate, vegetation composition shifted after 36 yr from a system dominated by herbaceous cover with a major graminoid component to one dominated by shrubs (5- to 6-fold absolute increase) and ferns (5-7% increase in absolute cover), less absolute herb cover (15-20% loss), and almost no graminoids (<1.5% cover remaining in any plot) after 36 yr. These changes represented a substantial loss in plant community diversity with a loss of 46 of 74 species. Elk abundance outside of the exclosures began to decline in the 1990s leading to parallel changes in plant community trajectories outside of exclosures to those initially seen inside. While this suggests plant community responses inside the exclosures were also driven by elk exclusion, the strength of this response depends on elk abundance.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have been overabundant in eastern North America for more than five decades, re-sulting in depauperate understories and ricocheting effects on higher trophic levels. Even after deer populations are reduced, understory plant communities may fail to recover for an unknown length of time due to persistent legacy effects. We surveyed understory plant communities in six deer exclosures and paired reference plots in northwestern Pennsylvania to determine the degree to which 19 years of deer exclusion was sufficient for recovery of species richness, diversity, percent cover, and un-derstory structural complexity. We observed a 2.3-fold increase in tree cover and a 60% reduction in fern cover in the ground layer, as well as a 114-fold increase in foliage density between 80 and 200 cm above ground level, in exclosures compared to reference plots. However, the exclosures did not permanently support higher overall percent cover, species richness, or di-versity in the ground layer, nor did we detect any meaningful divergence in community composition between exclosures and reference plots. We conclude that 19 years of release from chronic over-browsing are sufficient to restore understory structural complexity, but recovery of diversity in the ground layer will require more time or direct intervention.

AB  - Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and willows (Salix spp.) are keystone species of montane and shrub-steppe landscapes of the Western United States. Intact communities dominated by these species provide a wide range of ecosystem services, harboring an exceptional proportion of landscape biodiversity. Land use, especially overgrazing by large ungulates, is among the greatest threats to these ecosystems. To examine the effects of wild ungulates and levels of grazing at Yellowstone National Park (YNP) and the adjacent Gallatin National Forest, we sampled plant community composition and vegetation structure of aspen and willow communities both inside and outside of exclosures. Within the Park, we found that current grazing pressures from large ungulates, principally American Bison (Bison bison), have a dramatic effect on community composition and structure, resulting in a shift from a structurally diverse forest or tall shrub dominance to that of a grassland. On heavily grazed sites, shrubs common to semiarid uplands are now relatively abundant, as are exotic grass species, in contrast to an abundance of berry-producing shrubs within exclosures. Finally, large herbivores at unnaturally high densities are resulting in the simplification of landscape diversity outside of exclosures through a decline in the patch diversity of the site (i.e., homogenization of the landscape). Increases in exotic species and those adapted to semiarid environments suggest that current levels of bison use at YNP are amplifying the effects of climate change as well as resulting in a loss of biodiversity values. Inside exclosures, the inherent resilience of these keystone ecosystems was demonstrated by the recovery of plant diversity following decades of large ungulate utilization exceeding natural carrying capacity. This suggests that reductions in current grazing pressures within YNP would have positive feedbacks to beneficial ecosystem processes such as increased species and habitat diversity, increased carbon sequestration, and a greater adaptive capacity to climate change.

AB  - Questions: Herbivores can exert strong top-down control on vegetation structure and composition, which in turn can affect overall biodiversity and ecosystem processes. However, South American megafauna was largely driven to extinction in recent prehistory, and remaining species have suffered severe range reductions from human actions. The potential role of South American megafauna in shaping vegetation therefore remains unclear. We examined herbivore-driven top-down control of the vegetation, particularly impacts on plant diversity, structure and functional composition. LocationIber & aacute; Wetlands, Corrientes, Argentina. Methods: We set up an herbivore exclosure experiment in a restoration area with 10 wild large-herbivore species. We compared vegetation dynamics in fenced plots with paired control plots to which herbivores had full access. Replicate plot pairs were established in three grassland types: characterized as short, medium-tall and tall grasslands. Grass height, plant biomass, functional types and community composition were measured at the start of the experiment and after 6, 13 and 18 months. Results: We found that in short and medium-tall grasslands, herbaceous biomass and grass height increased significantly in no-grazing plots, while species richness decreased. Similarly, community dissimilarity between paired grazed and ungrazed plots increased over time for short and medium-tall grasslands. Camera trap images revealed that capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) was the dominant grazer on the grazed plots. Conclusion: Our results show a strong impact of native herbivores on the structure and composition of South American savannas akin to African grazing lawns, with higher plant species richness and dominance of grazing-tolerant growth forms. These results imply that South American grassy ecosystems, despite severely reduced herbivore richness and density, have retained plant taxa and functional trait complexes that tolerate intense herbivory. Further, they also show that herbivory can still play an important role in maintaining their plant diversity. The conservation and restoration of South American grassy ecosystems are likely to benefit from restoring functional grazing regimes.

AB  - Understanding the drivers of ecosystem collapse is critical for resource management, particularly for protected areas mandated to preserve biodiversity. In Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, tall willows (Salix spp.) dominated riparian vegetation, and a beaver-willow state was the natural ecosystem type in the Colorado River headwaters. However, willows comprise a portion of elk diets and are a preferred food for recently introduced moose, and the vegetation structure has changed dramatically since the early 2000s. To assess ecosystem changes, we analyzed time-series data on willow height from 1997 to 2021 inside and outside 3 exclosures built to exclude ungulates, area of tall willows in 1999 and 2019, area of open water from 1953 to 2019, vegetation composition in 1998 and 2021, groundwater depth from 1996 to 2021, surface water flow from 1953 to 2023, and climate from 1950 to 2023. Tall willow coverage and open water area declined by >90% from 1999 to 2019. Willow height outside the ungulate exclosures declined by more than 75% since the 1990s; yet, within exclosures that were formerly browsed, willow height increased by up to 500%. Tall willow communities have largely been replaced by grasslands. Browsing by elk and moose likely played a pivotal role in triggering a collapse of the beaver-willow state and the formation of an alternative moose-elk-grassland state that appears stable and may be difficult to reverse without direct human action. Restoration efforts will depend on a reduction in herbivory and reconnection of the river with its floodplain.

AB  - Increasing food production while avoiding negative impacts on biodiversity constitutes one of the main challenges of our time. Traditional silvopastoral systems like Iberian oak savannas ("dehesas") set an example, where free-range livestock has been reared for centuries while preserving a high natural value. Nevertheless, factors decreasing productivity need to be addressed, one being acorn losses provoked by pest insects. An increased and focalized grazing by livestock on infested acorns would kill the larvae inside and decrease pest numbers, but increased livestock densities could have undesired side effects on ground arthropod communities as a whole. We designed an experimental setup including areas under trees with livestock exclosures of different ages (shortterm: 1-year exclusion, long-term: 10-year exclusion), along with controls (continuous grazing), using DNA metabarcoding (mitochondrial markers COI and 16S) to rapidly assess arthropod communities' composition. Livestock removal quickly increased grass cover and arthropod taxonomic richness and diversity, which was already higher in short-term (1-year exclosures) than beneath the canopies of control trees. Interestingly, arthropod diversity was not highest at long-term exclosures (>= 10 years), although their community composition was the most distinct. Also, regardless of treatment, we found that functional diversity strongly correlated with the vegetation structure, being higher at trees beneath which there was higher grass cover and taller herbs. Overall, the taxonomic diversity peak at short term exclosures would support the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, which relates it with the higher microhabitat heterogeneity at moderately disturbed areas. Thus, we propose a rotatory livestock management in dehesas: plots with increased grazing should co-exist with temporal short-term exclosures. Ideally, a few long-term excluded areas should be also kept for the singularity of their arthropod communities. This strategy would make possible the combination of biological pest control and arthropod conservation in Iberian dehesas.

AB  - Chronically elevated ungulate browse pressure in temperate forests worldwide often generates ecological legacies characterized by low plant diversity and contributes to the formation of dense, nearly monodominant, and highly recalcitrant layers of understory vegetation. Once established, these recalcitrant layers combined with continued browsing may jointly constrain tree establishment and diversity so completely that understory recovery may be unattainable without mitigating browse pressure, the recalcitrant layer, or both. Here, we investigate the independent and synergistic effects of both white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) browsing and hay-scented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula) competition on tree regeneration in a 10-year experiment. Specifically, we examine how tree seedling establishment, growth, and composition are filtered by fern cover versus fern removal (gaps), browser presence versus absence (exclosures), and their combined effects during 10 years at three hardwood forest sites in Pennsylvania, USA. Fern gaps enhanced establishment for multiple tree species, increasing seedling density and diversity, particularly in the first 3 years post-treatment, and enhancing richness (<= 1 species) over the course of the experiment. Excluding deer for a decade increased the height growth of other regeneration and altered species composition, but had no effect on diversity, richness, and density. Notably, we observed higher Prunus serotina seedling densities outside exclosures, possibly due to greater secondary dispersal. We argue that browsing legacies in second growth forests established at the turn of the last century created two conditions inimical to diverse forest regeneration: an overstory dominated by two species, P. serotina and Acer rubrum (86% of basal area), and a dense recalcitrant understory layer dominated by a native fern. The first condition limits propagule supply, the second strongly filters seedling establishment, and both create impoverished forest understories composed of few individuals and species. In undisturbed forest understories, the inertia toward impoverishment was sustained across the decade even where browsing was eliminated. Consequently, stand replacing disturbances (whether natural or anthropogenic) that disrupt the understory layer and reinitiate succession may be necessary to propel forests out of their current stasis and down a pathway leading to greater diversity.

AB  - Large mammalian herbivores exert strong top-down control on plants, which in turn influence most ecological processes. Accordingly, the decline, displacement, or extinction of wild large herbivores in African savannas is expected to alter the physical structure of vegetation, the diversity of plant communities, and downstream ecosystem functions. However, herbivore impacts on vegetation comprise both direct and indirect effects and often depend on herbivore body size and plant type. Understanding how herbivores affect savanna vegetation requires disaggregating the effects of different herbivores and the responses of different plants, as well as accounting for both the structural complexity and composition of plant assemblages. We combined high-resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with field measurements from size-selective herbivore exclosures in Kenya to determine how herbivores affect the diversity and physical structure of vegetation, how these impacts vary with body size and plant type, and whether there are predictable associations between plant diversity and structural complexity. Herbivores generally reduced the diversity and abundance of both overstory and understory plants, though the magnitude of these impacts varied substantially as a function of body size and plant type: only megaherbivores (elephants and giraffes) affected tree cover, whereas medium- and small-bodied herbivores had stronger effects on herbaceous diversity and abundance. We also found evidence that herbivores altered the strength and direction of interactions between trees and herbaceous plants, with signatures of facilitation in the presence of herbivores and of competition in their absence. While megaherbivores uniquely affected tree structure, medium- and small-bodied species had stronger (and complementary) effects on metrics of herbaceous vegetation structure. Plant structural responses to herbivore exclusion were species-specific: of five dominant tree species, just three exhibited significant individual morphological variation across exclosure treatments, and the size class of herbivores responsible for these effects varied across species. Irrespective of exclosure treatment, more species-rich plant communities were more structurally complex. We conclude that the diversity and architecture of savanna vegetation depend on consumptive and nonconsumptive plant-herbivore interactions; the roles of herbivore diversity, body size, and plant traits in mediating those interactions; and a positive feedback between plant diversity and structural complexity.

AB  - Whistling thorn acacia (Acacia (Vachellia) drepanolobium) forms nearly monospecific stands among woody species in black cotton soils in East Africa arid highlands. The tree defends itself against large mammal herbivores with spinescence and symbiotic ants. While these defenses have been extensively studied, little is known about the extent to which A. drepanolobium defense may benefit other plants growing in close association. We examined variation in herbaceous vegetation height, biomass, and composition between areas underneath A. drepanolobium canopies and the adjacent matrix in both fenced herbivore exclosures and unfenced areas. In unfenced areas, there was more tall herbaceous vegetation and biomass underneath tree canopies than away from tree canopies, while these differences were not significant in fenced exclosures. Both height and biomass of understory vegetation were negatively correlated with A. drepanolobium canopy height. Species richness was higher underneath tree canopies in both fenced and unfenced locations. In the unfenced locations, species evenness was lower underneath tree canopies than in the surrounding matrix, but the opposite was true in the fenced herbivore exclosures. The differences in herbaceous vegetation composition (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index) between underneath tree and off tree locations were more pronounced in the unfenced areas than within the fenced herbivore exclosures. Our findings suggest that highly defended trees may moderate herbivore effects on herbaceous vegetation. To the extent that herbaceous vegetation underneath trees experiences protection from herbivory, such refugia microhabitats may serve as recolonization nuclei in attempts to restore chronically overgrazed systems.

AB  - QuestionIn productive grasslands highly dominated by a single plant species, herbivores can promote overall plant diversity. Wild boars (Sus scrofa) often decrease species diversity, alter regeneration and change community composition in their native and invader ranges while digging and uprooting vegetation for feeding. In addition, wild guinea pigs (Cavia aperea), a small vertebrate herbivore native to South America, concentrate their feeding activities in open patches where they also affect plant diversity, biomass and composition. In this context, can wild-boar disturbances promote plant diversity in herbaceous systems characterized by a highly dominant species? Can native wild guinea pigs magnify these impacts?LocationCoastal grasslands and salt marshes of the northeastern part of the temperate Argentine pampas, that are dominated by native or exotic herbaceous species.MethodsWe first analyzed alpha- and beta-diversity of plant assemblies in three natural coastal herbaceous areas, invaded by wild boars, through samplings (comparing disturbed and undisturbed areas) and experiments (using exclosures and control plots). Then, we analyzed whether wild guinea pigs could affect patch recovery (alpha- and beta-diversity) after wild-boar disturbances in one site.ResultsWild boars enhanced alpha-diversity (compared to undisturbed areas) but had no significant effect on beta-diversity. Nevertheless, wild guinea pigs feeding on wild-boar disturbances increased between-patch heterogeneity in species composition (i.e., beta-diversity).ConclusionWild boars remove vegetation in patches that, without subsequent wild-guinea-pig herbivory, dominant species rapidly recover. Wild-guinea-pig herbivory allows different subordinate species to peak at different disturbed patches, contributing to larger species richness at larger scales in areas otherwise occupied by highly dominant plant species. In a wider context, these results imply that the joint action of different-sized exotic and native herbivores can help to maintain plant species diversity in highly plant-dominated grasslands.
   Wild boar is an exotic species that generates bare soil patches that have positive effects for plant diversity in highly plant-dominated systems. These effects are mediated by a native small herbivore. Thus, the joint action of differently sized herbivores, native and exotic, can help to preserve plant diversity in highly dominated systems.image

AB  - Aims A key challenge in applied vegetation science is understanding the impact of herbivory on plant communities. Herbivores often reduce dominant species' abundance (biomass, cover), making resources available for new species and increasing plant diversity. This understanding is crucial in systems undergoing ecological restoration through trophic rewilding. In Iber & aacute; National Park, Argentina, jaguars (Panthera onca) are being reintroduced after a 70-year absence, and it is critical to assess the role of herbivores in shaping plant communities for evaluating future potential trophic cascades. Capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), the park's most abundant herbivore and an important prey for jaguars, likely exert significant pressure on vegetation. This study aims to investigate how capybara herbivory affects vegetation height, biomass, diversity, and composition, providing insights into how jaguar reintroduction might indirectly influence plant communities and restore ecosystem functionality through capybaras' demographic or behavioral responses. Location Iber & aacute; National Park, Corrientes, Argentina. Methods We simulated the absence of capybara foraging pressure by establishing 10 3 m x 3 m herbivore exclosures with adjacent unfenced control plots in the capybara's grazing lawns. Vegetation attributes-height, biomass, plant diversity, and species composition-were monitored over 4 years to assess the impact of capybara exclusion on plant communities. Results Excluding capybaras significantly increased vegetation height and biomass, which, in turn, altered plant diversity and species composition. The exclosures' vegetation height and biomass were consistently higher than those in control plots. A decrease in species diversity accompanied this shift, as the abundance of common species declined and the dominance of a few species increased, generating new communities. Conclusions Capybaras significantly influence vegetation dynamics, demonstrating their role in shaping plant communities. Excluding capybaras leads to species composition and structural shifts, highlighting herbivory's importance in maintaining ecosystem heterogeneity. These findings provide critical baseline data for understanding the potential indirect impacts of the jaguar's reintroduction on plant communities and ecosystem processes. This study contributes valuable insights into the ecological mechanisms underlying plant-herbivore interactions, which are essential for guiding restoration practices and rewilding strategies.

AB  - While numerous studies focus on the ecosystem effects of invasive mammals, few explore the causal mechanisms of such effects. Wild boar is one of the most widely introduced invasive mammal species in the world. By overturning extensive areas of vegetation and soil to feed on belowground resources, wild boar alter the soil food web and thus many microbial-mediated soil processes. Here, we take advantage of a long-term, 8-year, wild boar exclosure experiment across three plant community types in Patagonia, Argentina to explore how wild boar impact soil communities and their potential function. Previous work in this experimental system found that wild boar significantly impacted litter decomposition in the field, but it remained unclear if this effect was mediated through changes in abiotic or biotic soil properties. To explore both the abiotic and biotic drivers of decomposition, we measured soil moisture, soil temperature, soil bulk density, and soil respiration as well as soil micro-arthropod richness and abundance, earthworm abundance, and microbial biomass inside and outside of 10 exclosures in each of three plant community types. To assess potential microbial activity, we measured potential decomposition rates, substrate-induced respiration, and soil microbial enzyme activity. Rooting decreased soil moisture by 18% across plant communities, and soil respiration by 30% in Nothofagus and Austrocedrus forests. Additionally, rooting decreased soil microarthropod richness and abundance by similar to 80% in shrublands. However, rooting had no effect on soil potential microbial activity. Together, our results suggest that changes in both abiotic and biotic soil factors likely mediate observed wild boar impact on decomposition rates. Overall, we show that wild boar rooting alters soil functioning, but the pathway of impact varies by plant community, suggesting that wild boar impacts on native ecosystems can be difficult to predict.

AB  - Large herbivores introduced to novel habitats can cause major ecosystem impacts. While impacts of overabundant deer have been documented around the world, there are few examples from Australia, where deer are non-native and natural predators are absent.Here, we outline the impacts of sambar deer in wet eucalypt forest understoreys of the Yarra Ranges National Park, south-eastern Australia. Using data obtained from a full and partial (permitting native herbivores) exclusion experiment over four years, we (i) demonstrate differences between native herbivore and introduced deer browsing, (ii) identify plant species commonly browsed by deer, and (iii) provide evidence that vegetation condition can recover in the absence of deer.While species richness and composition were unaffected, the exclusion of deer led to substantial recovery of several attributes of forest understorey vegetation. Treatments excluding deer (partial and full exclosures) saw increases in the cover of understorey trees, shrubs, ferns and climbers. Within the 1-2 m height class (the primary deer browse zone), vegetation cover-abundance increased 3-4 fold over time in full and partial exclusion plots compared to non-exclusion controls.Tree ferns (Dicksonia antarctica and Cyathea australis) were particularly impacted by deer, and browsing impacts to tree ferns were dramatically reduced from similar to 50% of fronds browsed to negligible levels with deer exclusion. Deer exclusion also saw substantial reductions in browsing to individual trees, shrubs and ground ferns. The growth of commonly browsed trees, e.g. Pomaderris aspera, were demonstrably higher in partial and full exclosures than unfenced control plots. The low levels of browsing on trees and shrubs that persisted in partial exclosures probably indicates the background levels of browsing pressure attributable to native herbivores in these forests.In the absence of effective deer control, commonly browsed understorey trees, shrubs and tree ferns are likely to decrease substantially in cover over coming decades, potentially leading to increased light availability, drying of the understorey, and increased susceptibility to wildfire. The potential cascading ecological effects of unabated and increasing deer impacts may be substantial and pose major challenges to forest management.Despite management culls and recreational hunting in recent years, deer populations are increasing across Australia. As sambar populations increase, ecological impacts are likely to exacerbate. It is therefore critically important to reduce sambar numbers, before negative and potentially irreversible changes occur to forest structure, composition and function.

AB  - QuestionOverbrowsing by abundant deer reshapes the composition of forests from palatable native species to browse-tolerant species, leading to simplified understories with reduced biodiversity. Here, we ask whether geologic refugia (e.g., tall boulders) will provide a haven for vulnerable plant species to escape browsing pressure from high populations of native deer.LocationHuron Mountains, Michigan, USA.MethodsWe compared the percent cover, species richness, and Shannon diversity of all plant species on tall boulders to adjacent fenced exclosures and to forest floor reference plots to quantify the degree to which deer impact one of the largest remaining tracts of old-growth forests in the Eastern United States.ResultsWe found that boulders contained 60% higher richness and diversity than reference plots, as well as a more diverse mix of midstory species, shrubs, and forbs. Seven-year-old exclosure and reference plots were nearly indistinguishable from each other and were dominated by Acer saccharum and other browse-tolerant species.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that boulders are a highly effective, though rarely used, proxy or bioassay of the degree to which chronic overbrowsing creates impoverished understories composed of browse-tolerant or unpalatable species. Our findings highlight the significance of refugia as a haven from overbrowsing for vulnerable plant species and emphasize the importance of using exclosures alongside refugia.

AB  - Questions: Facilitation by pioneer plants and herbivore exclusion may contribute to plant regeneration and restoration of degraded semiarid ecosystems. In this study we evaluated the main and interactive effects of the exclusion of large and medium-sized mammal herbivores and the presence of the pioneer tree Vachellia caven on natural regeneration of woody species in degraded savannas.
   Location: Two localities of the native sclerophyllous forest of central Chile
   Methods: Twelve 30 x 40 m exclosures and twelve non-exclosure areas located near native forests were established in savannas of V. caven in each locality. Regeneration coming from seeds and resprouts was sampled both under the canopy of V. caven and without canopy in each exclosure and non-excluded area.
   Results: After seven years, species richness and density of older regeneration (0.5-2 m high) were positively affected by herbivore exclusion and the presence of V. caven. No significant interaction between herbivore exclusion and V. caven was observed. Younger regeneration (<0.5 m high) was positively affected by herbivore exclusion and the presence of V. caven only in some years with almost no interactive effect.
   Conclusions: The exclusion of large and medium-sized exotic herbivores and facilitation by pioneer trees are complementary for regeneration. The variable but permanent presence of younger and older regeneration within exclosures and under V. caven during the experiment may lead to an increase of density and diversity of adult plants and recovery of the native forest. However, this process may be slow due to other limiting factors, for instance, reduced precipitation associated with climate change.

AB  - Through their foraging and habitat selection, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) can have profound effects on forest plant communities that produce persistent legacy effects. To examine the duration of persistence of potential legacy effects, we investigated the long-term consequences of deer herbivory in plant communities following canopy gap creation in a hemlock-northern hardwood forest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Twenty artificial canopy gaps were created during the winter of 2002-03: seven small gaps (50-150 m(2)), seven medium gaps (151-250 m(2)), and six large gaps (251-450 m(2)). Herbaceous layer communities were sampled within arrays of exclosed and nonexclosed sample plots, established within a few years of gap creation, during the summer of 2020 and compared to a previous study conducted in 2007. Eighteen years following canopy gap creation, herbaceous layer communities exhibited both persistent and transient legacies of deer herbivory. Persistent legacies included similarity of small to large gaps compositionally and low abundance of browse-sensitive species outside of exclosures. Transient patterns included initial high graminoid cover and low cover of trees in the ground layer outside of exclosures and differences in diversity between gap size classes. Some emergent patterns were also observed, including declining floristic quality indices over time but sustained high occurrence of a number of species with moderately high coefficients of conservatism on deer access plots, albeit at low abundance. Differential compositional trajectories emerged based on gap-specific tree species colonization patterns. Our results suggest that through differential foraging patch selection and control of woody regeneration, white-tailed deer may alter or reinforce patterns of dominance depending on initial conditions. These interactions may result in context-specific persistent, transient, and emergent dynamics as plant communities recover from canopy disturbance.

AB  - Introduced ungulates can impact forest structure and composition. We tested in rainforests of New Caledonia if exclosure of invasive ungulates (Javan rusa deer Rusa timorensis russa and feral pigs Sus (scrofa) domesticus) increased abundance, species richness and diversity of native plants by comparing 19 plots of 10 m2 in four study areas that were protected from browsing for 7 years with 76 unprotected plots. Abundance, species richness and diversity of native plants of 20-60 cm of height were higher in protected plots compared to unprotected plots. We attribute the measured negative impact mainly to deer as the positive effect of exclosures was highest in the study area with the highest deer abundance and browsing rate. The exclosures were also beneficial in a secondary forest with medium deer abundance whereas in old-growth forest with medium deer abundance we could not detect an effect of the exclosures. We conclude that protecting even small areas from browsing by invasive ungulates can increase biodiversity and that exclosures are most beneficial at high deer abundance and in secondary habitats.

AB  - Vegetation over-foraged by deer shows limited recovery potential for some species, even when exclosures are constructed. Turf and topsoil translocation might aid in restoring this vegetation. We evaluated the effectiveness of turf and topsoil translocation in restoring the overgrazed understory herbaceous vegetation in Saorigahara, covered by coniferous/broadleaf deciduous mixed forest in Shikoku, Japan. The herbaceous vegetation there has been degraded by overgrazing, but it has recovered in an exclosure constructed in 2008 (E2008). In November 2021 and March 2022, turf and topsoil of herbaceous communities within the E2008 were translocated to exclosures constructed in 2021. We monitored the recovery of the herbaceous communities, evaluating the impacts of the light environment, the translocation season, and the presence of water puddles, while also comparing the effectiveness of turf and topsoil translocations. We selected 22 herbaceous species, which have been identified within E2008 during 2008-2018, as the restoration target species. Translocated plots exhibited higher restoration in terms of the number of species, coverage, and maximum plant height of the restoration target species compared to the plots where translocations were not implemented. Nine restoration target species did not recover in any of the plots. The restoration target species showed better recovery in plots translocated in November 2021 and in turf translocated plots. This study indicates that turf translocation is more effective in restoring overgrazed understory herbaceous vegetation than merely constructing exclosures.

AB  - Trophic rewilding is increasingly being used to promote megafauna reintroductions to island ecosystems, yet ecosystem response to population restoration once megafauna reintroduction occurs remains understudied. In this study of a population of Galapagos giant tortoises reintroduced to an arid island, tortoise exclosures monitored over an 8-year-long period revealed that, in response to the presence of tortoises, herbaceous plant cover and numbers of regenerating woody plants decreased, whereas extent of grass cover increased. Vegetation mapping over a 15-year-long period across the island indicated a threshold density of 1-2 tortoises per hectare halted incursion of woody plants and triggered a shift in this savannah-type ecosystem toward more grasses. Restoration of this giant tortoise population has shaped plant communities at both local and landscape scales with cascading effects on many components of biodiversity on the island.

AB  - Plant species richness is an important property of ecosystems that is altered by grazing. In a semiarid environment, we tested the hypotheses that (1) small-scale herbaceous plant species richness declines linearly with increasing grazing intensity by large ungulates, (2) precipitation and percent sand interact with grazing intensity, and (3) response of herbaceous plant species richness to increasing intensity of ungulate grazing varies with patch productivity. During January-March 2012, we randomly allocated 50, 1.5-m x 1.5-m grazing exclosures within each of six 2500 ha study sites across South Texas, USA. We counted the number of herbaceous plant species and harvested vegetation in 0.25-m(2) plots within exclosures (ungrazed control plots) and in the grazed area outside the exclosures (grazed treatment plots) during October-November 2012-2019. We estimated percent use (grazing intensity) based on the difference in herbaceous plant standing crop between control plots and treatment plots. We selected the negative binomial regression model that best explained the relationship between grazing intensity and herbaceous plant species richness using the Schwarz-Bayesian information criterion. After accounting for the positive effect of precipitation and percent sand on herbaceous plant species richness, species richness/0.25 m(2) increased slightly from 0% to 30% grazing intensity and then declined with increasing grazing intensity. Linear and quadratic responses of herbaceous plant species richness to increasing grazing intensity were greater for the least productive patches (<15.7 g/0.25 m(2)) than for productive patches (>= 15.7 g/0.25 m(2)). Our results followed the pattern predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis model for the effect of grazing intensity on small-scale herbaceous plant species richness.

AB  - With the recent recovery of large carnivores in Europe, preventive measures to protect livestock are on the rise. Fences that exclude carnivores from grazing areas have been proven as effective, but they can be costly as well as posing a barrier for wildlife. We studied the effect of exclosures of > 10 km(2) to protect sheep Ovis aries on the distribution and density of moose Alces alces using fecal pellet group counts in two study areas in southeastern Norway. During the summer grazing season, the fences were powered. Outside of the grazing season, one exclosure remained fenced while the other fence was demounted. This quasi-experimental setting allowed us to investigate whether fences had a barrier effect for moose, and/or whether moose density was affected by interactions with sheep (competition or facilitation) or large carnivores (refuge hypothesis). During winter, moose pellet group density was about equal inside and outside of the exclosure with demounted wire strands, but less than half inside the permanently fenced exclosure compared to outside, indicating a potential fragmentation effect of the fence. During the grazing season, when wire strands were powered, moose pellet group density was equal or doubled inside as compared to outside both exclosures. Moose may have sought refuge from large carnivores inside the fences. Fecal pellet group densities of moose and sheep inside the fence were neither positively (facilitation) nor negatively (competition) correlated. However, moose used young forest, the most used habitat type by sheep, to a lesser extent inside than outside of the exclosures, maybe due to interference competition. Our study demonstrates that livestock protection fences can have an impact on more than the targeted wildlife species. To understand the mechanisms behind direct and indirect effects of fences, monitoring the movement and survival of individuals by means of GPS and camera traps would be needed.

AB  - Plant communities in rangeland ecosystems vary widely in the degree to which they can compensate for losses to herbivores. Ecosystem-level factors have been proposed to affect this compensatory capacity, including timing and intensity of grazing, and availability of soil moisture and nutrients. Arid ecosystems are particularly challenging to predict because of their high degree of temporal variability in moisture inputs. We used a replicated herbivore exclusion experiment to evaluate herbaceous plant responses to grazing by large ungulates to test current theory and identify constraints on plant compensation in a dryland ecosystem. We measured nitrogen (N) yield and herbaceous production in three plant communities: meadows, willow-associated herbaceous communities, and riparian communities. We implemented grazing exclusion treatments from 2005 to 2008 in areas with elk and bison and areas with only elk. Grazing by large ungulates increased herbaceous production and N yield in herbaceous riparian communities. In willow communities, herbaceous plants displayed equal compensation in response to grazing in total aboveground production and N yield. Our results support the idea that plant compensation in this semiarid system is contingent on soil moisture availability, wherein the most productive sites (that received substantial moisture inputs from subsurface flow) exhibited overcompensation. Although the herbaceous riparian communities we studied are isolated patches of productive grassland in an otherwise shrub-dominated and minimally productive semiarid landscape, grazing by a combination of bison and elk removed only 44%-53% of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) during the growing season, and 25%-38% of production over winter. Consumption by ungulates was a positive linear function of herbaceous production, similar to reported patterns from other temperate and tropical grazing ecosystems. The slope of this relationship was affected by the analytical method used to calculate ANPP and consumption rates, but, regardless of the method, was lower or similar to reported slopes for other intensively grazed systems (Yellowstone, Serengeti, Laikipia) that have sustained high ungulate densities for decades to centuries. Given that the vegetation communities exhibited equal or overcompensation in terms of total herbaceous ANPP in both years, elk and bison population levels during our study period did not appear to occur at densities leading to degradation of herbaceous communities.

AB  - Forests are major carbon (C) sinks, but their ability to sequester C and thus mitigate climate change, varies with the environment, disturbance regime, and biotic interactions. Herbivory by invasive, nonnative ungulates can have profound ecosystem effects, yet its consequences for forest C stocks remain poorly understood. We determined the impact of invasive ungulates on C pools, both above- and belowground (to 30 cm), and on forest structure and diversity using 26 paired long-term (>20 years) ungulate exclosures and adjacent unfenced control plots located in native temperate rainforests across New Zealand, spanning 36-41 degrees S. Total ecosystem C was similar between ungulate exclosure (299.93 +/- 25.94 Mg C ha(-1)) and unfenced control (324.60 +/- 38.39 Mg C ha(-1)) plots. Most (60%) variation in total ecosystem C was explained by the biomass of the largest tree (mean diameter at breast height [dbh]: 88 cm) within each plot. Ungulate exclusion increased the abundance and diversity of saplings and small trees (dbh >= 2.5, <10 cm) compared with unfenced controls, but these accounted for similar to 5% of total ecosystem C, demonstrating that a few, large trees dominate the total forest ecosystem C but are unaffected by invasive ungulates at a timescale of 20-50 years. However, changes in understory C pools, species composition, and functional diversity did occur following long-term ungulate exclusion. Our findings suggest that, although the removal of invasive herbivores may not affect total forest C at the decadal scale, major shifts in the diversity and composition of regenerating species will have longer term consequences for ecosystem processes and forest C.

AB  - The moose Alces alces is the largest herbivore in the boreal forest biome, where it can have dramatic impacts on ecosystem structure and dynamics. Despite the importance of the boreal forest biome in global carbon cycling, the impacts of moose have only been studied in disparate regional exclosure experiments, leading to calls for common analyses across a biome-wide network of moose exclosures.In this study, we use airborne laser scanning (ALS) to analyse forest canopy responses to moose across 100 paired exclosure-control experimental plots distributed across the boreal biome, including sites in the United States (Isle Royale), Canada (Quebec, Newfoundland), Norway, Sweden and Finland.We test the hypotheses that canopy height, vertical complexity and above-ground biomass (AGB) are all reduced by moose and that the impacts vary with moose density, productivity, temperature and pulse disturbances such as logging and insect outbreaks.We find a surprising convergence in forest canopy response to moose. Moose had negative impacts on canopy height, complexity and AGB as expected. The responses of canopy complexity and AGB were consistent across regions and did not vary along environmental gradients. The difference in canopy height between exclosures and open plots was on average 6 cm per year since the start of exclosure treatment (+/- 2.1 SD). This rate increased with temperature, but only when moose density was high.The difference in AGB between moose exclosures and open plots was 0.306 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) (+/- 0.079). In browsed plots, stand AGB was 32% of that in the exclosures, a difference of 2.09 Mg ha(-1). The uniform response allows scaling of the estimate to a biome-wide impact of moose of the loss of 448 (+/- 115) Tg per year, or 224 Tg of carbon.Synthesis: Analysis of ALS data from distributed exclosure experiments identified a largely uniform response of forest canopies to moose across regions, facilitating scaling of moose impacts across the whole biome. This is an important step towards incorporating the effect of the largest boreal herbivore on the carbon cycling of one of the world's largest terrestrial biomes.

AB  - The effect of wild ungulate density on ecosystems varies according to different factors: climate and physiography conditions, forest type, management history, and herbivore identity. In this study, we evaluated the effect of historically high densities of red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) on the soil fungal communities in Mediterranean ecosystems using 30 paired plots, open on the one hand and exclosure plots on the other one. Plots were established at the end of 2020 in a perimeter -fenced hunting estate of 6600 ha in Toledo, Spain. Three months after plots were established, we analysed fungal communities in 60 soil samples using Illumina 250 -bp paired -end sequencing. We estimated changes in total fungal richness and in the richness of trophic groups through Linear Mixed Effects models using fenced/unfenced type and deer habitat use as fixed variables and the location of the plots and the main tree host species as random variables. Fungal composition was analysed using nonmetric multidimensional scaling and permutational multivariate ANOVA; edaphic characteristics were incorporated to explain differences. Soil fungal communities were not differentially affected by excluding ungulates for three months. Areas with high deer densities had a richer saprotrophic community and where lowland environments were dominated by the main tree hosts Quercus faginea and Quercus ilex. Arbutus unedo was found in mountain areas where there was less herbivore pressure, a greater richness of ectomycorrhizal and lichenized fungi and soils positively associated to nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and organic matter levels.

AB  - QuestionHow does naturalistic grazing (trophic rewilding with large herbivores), in contrast to mowing and free succession (no grazing), affect plant community composition and species richness in temperate grassland grazed by semi-feral cattle and horses? LocationMols Laboratory, Denmark. MethodsWe investigated grazing exclosures in the rewilding area of the Mols Laboratory, four years after its establishment. We focused on moist to dry grassland vegetation, that is, excluding scrub and woodland. Each experimental block consisted of five 5 x 9 m plots, representing four fenced treatments, that is, summer-only grazing, winter-only grazing, full exclosure with annual autumn mowing and full exclosure with passive succession. The matrix (the fifth treatment) was grazed by large herbivores at close-to-natural densities, that is, regulated bottom-up by the carrying capacity of the area. Hence, even the seasonal grazing treatments were grazed at close-to-natural animal density. Quantitative plant community composition was assessed using the point-intercept method in 25 x 25 cm quadrats, supplemented with biomass calibration models based on additional quadrats, in which above-ground plant biomass was harvested after recording and the material sorted to species and weighed. Uniqueness was assessed as the sum of inverse range sizes for constituent species (unicity). ResultsWe found an appreciably higher plant species richness in grazing treatments than under both annual mowing and full exclosure, but only minor differences between seasonal grazing treatments. Uniqueness was highest in year-round and winter-only grazing and lowest in summer-only grazing. The forb:graminoid ratio tended to be high in the winter-only grazing treatment, whereas annual mowing was associated with dominance of graminoids over forbs. Full-exclosure plots had accumulation of litter and the lowest species richness. Initial heterogeneity between plots within blocks and a systematic difference between blocks in moist and dry grasslands may have diluted treatment effects at this early point after the onset of the experiment. Data analysis using the biomass estimates derived from the calibration models yielded only minor differences in the patterns described above, when compared to the results obtained using the raw number of intercepts. ConclusionsNaturalistic grazing is a goal in itself in ecological restoration, but also proposed as an efficient management tool to promote conservation of grassland plants and communities. We found both plant species richness and the prevalence of regionally rarer species (uni) to be higher with grazing than mowing or abandonment. Similarly, the tendency for forbs to prevail under grazing may translate into enhanced floral resources for anthophilous insects. Summer-only grazing at low density of large herbivores was not significantly different from winter-only and year-round grazing, but this treatment was much closer to natural grazing than intensive summer grazing typical of agri-environmental practices.

AB  - Different species-specific traits of woody plant species, feeding preferences of herbivores together with resulting effects on plant competition are expected to translate into different plant community structures and expressions of biodiversity. We studied the diversity of woody plant species (trees and shrubs) and structural diversity of forest trees, using a 30-year and an 18-year dataset of ungulate exclosure-control plot pairs in a mixed alpine forest community in Austria. We surveyed the tallest individuals per tree species and plot and analyzed the collective of top-height individuals per plot pair. Incidence data for exclosure and control plots were aggregated. Comparing species diversity and diversity of height classes on the plots throughout time, we calculated diversity profiles based on Hill numbers. Diversity of top height individuals and structural diversity, expressed by height classes, were two diversity aspects that differed between exclosures and control plots. Other diversity estimates of woody plant species showed huge variation without significant differences between plots. Height growth was significantly suppressed by ungulate herbivory. Effects of ungulate herbivores in forest ecosystems are highly complex and context-dependent and thus not reducible to simple top-down forces. Long-term surveys provide data that reflect "ultimate" effects of herbivory interacting with other drivers of community dynamics.

AB  - 1. Ungulate herbivory is a key natural disturbance in many ecosystems. In forest ecosystems, ungulate herbivory often co-occurs with other disturbances yet there are few studies looking at the cumulative impacts of ungulates and other natural disturbances on forest dynamics.
   2. We report on an 18-year experiment to investigate the combined effects of introduced, non-native moose and native spruce budworm herbivory on balsam fir forest recruitment and regeneration. Specifically, we measured inputs into early life-history components of balsam fir dominant boreal forest ecosystems such as seed density, seedbed quality, seedling and sapling height and density, as well as adult density in eight paired moose exclosure and control sites across a spruce budworm disturbance gradient (i.e. no outbreak, recent outbreak, old outbreak) that resulted in closed, partially open and open canopies.
   3. Piecewise structural equation models (SEMs) revealed a strong negative effect of spruce budworm disturbance on balsam fir adult density and indirect effects of this budworm disturbance on balsam fir seedling and sapling density mediated through adult density. We observed a similar pattern of budworm disturbance effects on balsam fir seed density with the lowest densities in sites with open canopy, then partially open and closed canopies. As expected, the SEM showed a positive effect of bryophyte seedbed cover on balsam fir seedling density. The SEM showed support for a positive effect of moose exclusion on balsam fir sapling height and density. Specifically, saplings were on average taller and denser in exclosure than control plots and these differences are most pronounced at sites with partially open canopies created by spruce budworm disturbance and undisturbed or closed canopy sites. Overall, we show evidence for cumulative and interactive effects of spruce budworm and moose herbivory on all life stages of balsam fir and such effects are negatively affecting regeneration of balsam fir forests.
   4. Human activities are creating conditions that facilitate the expansion and increased impacts of herbivores on boreal ecosystem functioning. A greater understanding of how ungulate herbivory interacts with other disturbances is needed to improve our predictions of forest ecosystem dynamics under global change.

AB  - In the pine forests of Mexico, disturbances are primarily due to cattle, horses, goat, and sheep grazing, particularly in communal grazing lands. The most evident disturbances are low tree recruitment, invasive shrubs establishment, species composition changes, and invasion of weeds dispersed mainly by livestock. The Sierra de Zapaliname is a mountain range and natural protected area of northeast Mexico. We conducted the current study in this area in a forest stand of Pinus cembroides excluded from grazing in the last 25 years (1200 ha with pine forest vegetation and mountain chaparral) and another area nearby subjected to livestock grazing. Forest structure (basal area and density), tree species richness, total understory species richness, and understory species composition were analyzed at the control and grazed sites. Our results revealed that grazing has modified the understory species composition and reduced the evenness in the control plots. Therefore, to maintain species diversity and forest structure, we concluded that extensive grazing should be restricted for some areas or the number of animals reduced in zones of high ecological value.

AB  - AimsOvergrazing by excessive deer populations harms native plant communities across most north temperate and boreal regions. In regions where deer impact is particularly severe, fencing is sometimes employed as a conservation measure to safeguard rare and threatened species and ecosystems. Here we examine how forest vascular plant communities have been affected by 21 years of sika deer exclusion by fencing of a 900 ha area.LocationNikko National Park, Tochigi prefecture, Japan.MethodsWe surveyed vascular plant cover in 240 plots and measured forest density on both sides of the fence in stands dominated by larch (Larix kaempferi) and oak (Quercus crispula).ResultsVascular plant species richness was found to be lower in forest areas protected by the fence. At the same time, dwarf bamboo, often the most abundant understory component in Japanese open forests, was taller and denser inside the fence where deer had been excluded. In addition, the lack of natural tree regeneration inside the fence, likely due to strong dwarf bamboo competition, was also notable. This suggests that deer exclusion has benefitted dwarf bamboo while inhibiting the competition of other species, thereby lowering vascular plant richness. Vascular plant communities outside the fence instead seem to be strongly shaped by abundant sika deer; several species found there are known to be unpalatable or grazing tolerant, and there were few tree seedlings.ConclusionThese results show that fencing to protect forest flora against overgrazing may have unintended consequences where there is a risk that competitive species can dominate understory plant communities. Instead of fencing, improved game management to maintain moderate deer populations may be a better strategy for large-scale conservation of forest flora and for promoting natural tree regeneration.

AB  - Rare grassland herbs are increasingly threatened by increase in large herbivores. Exclosures that exclude large herbivores can be effective tools for the protection and conservation of grazed plant communities. However, installation of the exclosures in abandoned semi-natural grasslands has two aspects: protection of vegetation and elimination of disturbance by herbivores. We aimed to clarify the exclosures promote or hinder the conservation of grassland herbs in a semi-natural grassland. The field survey was conducted in a semi-natural grassland under grazing pressure by sika deer in central Japan. Fences were erected in 2010 and 2011. Plant species composition and species in flower were recorded from 2011 to 2022 inside and outside the fences. We compared the change of species composition with species composition data recorded in the same grassland patch in 1980s, before deer numbers increased, as reference. Within the fence erected in 2010, species composition was getting similar to the reference from 2011 to 2017, but regressed by 2022. Correspondingly, the cover of grassland herbs and the number of grassland herbs in flower first increased and then decreased. Tree species conversely increased from 2017 to 2022. Within the fence erected in 2011, the species composition was hardly getting similar to the reference, and grassland herb cover remained lower. Long-term fencing can lead to a decline in grassland herbs with an increase in competing shrubs though the grassland herbs temporarily increase within the fence erected earlier. Anthropogenic disturbance may be necessary for the conservation of grassland herbs in long-term fenced grassland communities.

AB  - Reintroducing megafauna to reinstate missing top-down trophic interactions (trophic rewilding) is increasingly being applied as a tool to promote self-regulating, biodiverse ecosystems. Even though the theoretical background is clear, and megafauna effects are documented from prehistorical ecosystems, the effects of reintroduced herbivores in contemporary ecosystems remain understudied. This not only includes how reintroduced megafauna interact with each other and the ecosystem, but also how current management practices affect the processes they provide. In this study, we investigated the effects of proactive health management, that is, winter feeding and anti-parasitic treatments on the ecosystem by examining diets of large herbivores and dung-associated invertebrate communities. We used environmental DNA metabarcoding to yield community compositions of plants and invertebrates in dung from cattle and horses from five comparable nature sites in Denmark, which differed in management and site/population-specific properties such as availability of woody plant species, herbivore densities and provision of winter feeding and anti-parasitic treatments. We found different diet compositions between cattle and horses, highlighting their functional differences. For example, horse samples had higher relative read abundances of graminoid and tree DNA. Supplementary feeding affected diets by decreasing consumption of graminoids and tree species relative to forbs and legumes, probably originating from fodder, and intense feeding seemed to almost eliminate consumption of local vegetation. However, more studies are needed to generalize these findings. Several invertebrate families were associated with either cattle or horse dung, suggesting complementary effects on dung-associated invertebrate biodiversity by these large grazers. The taxa that responded negatively to anti-parasitic treatments were mainly parasitic nematodes (e.g. the families Ancylostomatidae, Cooperidae and Strongylidae), suggesting that the applied treatments work as intended, but these results should be interpreted with caution due to methodological limitations. Synthesis and application. Our findings demonstrate functional differences between cattle and horses, which suggest complementary effects on vegetation development and consequently biodiversity. Also, our results indicate that this functionality is impacted by proactive health management actions. We suggest that potential effects on herbivory and biodiversity are carefully considered before supplementary feeding, or anti-veterinary treatments are provided in year-round grazing systems and avoided if possible.

AB  - Over a quarter of the world's land surface is grazed by cattle and other livestock, which are replacing wild herbivores, potentially impairing ecosystem structure, and functions. Previous research suggests that cattle at moderate stocking rates can functionally replace wild herbivores in shaping understory communities. However, it is uncertain whether this is also true under high stocking rates and the effects of wild herbivore on plant communities are moderate, enhanced, or simply additive to the effects of cattle at high stocking rates. To evaluate the influence of cattle stocking rates on the ability of cattle to functionally replace wild herbivores and test for interactive effects between cattle and wild herbivores in shaping understory vegetation, we assessed herbaceous vegetation in a long-term exclosure experiment in a semi-arid savanna in central Kenya that selectively excludes wild mesoherbivores (50-1000 kg) and megaherbivores (elephant and giraffe). We tested the effects of cattle stocking rate (zero/moderate/high) on herbaceous vegetation (diversity, composition, leafiness). We also tested how those effects depend on the presence of wild mesoherbivores and megaherbivores. We found that herbaceous community composition (primary ordination axis) was better explained by the presence/absence of herbivore types than by total herbivory, suggesting that herbivore identity is a more important determinant of community composition than total herbivory at high cattle stocking rates. The combination of wild mesoherbivores and cattle stocked at high rates led to increased bare ground and annual grass cover, reduced perennial grass cover and understory leafiness, and enhanced understory diversity. These shifts were weaker or absent when cattle were stocked at high stocking rates in the absence of wild mesoherbivores. Megaherbivores tempered the effects of cattle stocked at high rates on herbaceous community composition but amplified the effects of high cattle stocking rate on bare ground and understory diversity. Our results show that cattle at high stocking rates do not functionally replace wild herbivores in shaping savanna herbaceous communities contrary to previous findings at moderate stocking rates. In mixed-use rangelands, interactions between cattle stocking rate and wild herbivore presence can lead to non-additive vegetation responses with important implications for both wildlife conservation and livestock production.

AB  - Deer browsing is a form of selective disturbance that homogenizes plant community composition and structure. In mountainous regions, disturbance intensity, together with topographical factors, affect plant communities. However, studies on the multiple effects of deer browsing and topographical factors on plant communities are limited. Here, we investigated the effects of deer exclusion on understory vegetation across the upper and lower slopes of a temperate deciduous forest in a mountainous area of Japan. We established six pairs of exclosure and control quadrats, with three pairs at each topographical position. We assessed changes in vegetation and plant structure (coverage and height), species composition, numbers of flowering/fruiting species, and damage to the plant species caused by deer browsing between 2009-2016. Vegetation coverage and the number of flowering/fruiting plant species increased in the exclosure quadrats during the study period, indicating that browsing prevents herb-layer species from reaching the flowering and fruiting stages in this site. Moreover, dissimilarity in species composition between the exclosure and control quadrats increased on the upper slope. However, the dissimilarity between upper and lower slopes in the control quadrats tended to decrease. Large herbs, which mainly include forbs and perennial species, were characteristically abundant on the lower slopes and decreased in the control quadrats on the lower slope. Our results indicate that the exclusion of deer had different effects on the understory vegetation of upper and lower slopes, suggesting that deer overbrowsing weakens the correlation between plant functional traits and topographic factors, resulting in homogenized plant communities.

AB  - Old growth forests are increasingly rare but important carbon sinks which harbour rich biodiversity. Chronic browsing by the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is a threat to the sustainability of the services provided by these forests, particularly in northern temperate forests where deer numbers have increased in recent decades (driven by stricter hunting rules and reduced predation) and necessitating local monitoring of vegetation responses. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of deer exclusion on tree regeneration dynamics and soil nutrients in an old growth Carolinian forest. This was performed using exclusion fencing and tip-up mounds at McMaster Forest Nature Preserve and the Sheelah Dunn Dooley Nature Sanctuary in Hamilton Ontario. Tree regeneration was surveyed from thirty 1 m x 1 m quadrats within exclusion plots and another thirty quadrats from deer-browsed areas adjacent to the exclusion plots. Soil samples were taken from each quadrat to analyze browsing impacts on nitrate, phosphate and soil organic matter. Red oak (Quercus rubra) was planted at the top and base of tip-up mounds of varying heights and widths and monitored for deer access and browsing activity. Results show a significantly higher density of woody plants within exclosures compared to non-exclosures (p = 0.0089) and twice more abundance of highly palatable species within the exclosures. However, species richness (p > 0.05) and diversity (p > 0.05) were minimally impacted by deer browsing, showing a resilient old growth forest. Soil nitrate was consistently higher in the non-exclosures, while phosphate was consistently higher within deer exclosures. Finally, more seedlings survived at the top of mounds than the bases, showing the potential of tip-up mounds to be a natural method of deer exclusion and a critical avenue for restoring over-browsed forests.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) (hereafter, 'deer') and invasive plants affect forest understories, but few studies have investigated their interaction. We investigated long-term (11-yr) effects of excluding deer and removing the invasive shrub, Amur honeysuckle [Lonicera maackii (Rupr.) Herder], on plants in southwest Ohio. Deer exclusion enhanced tree seedling richness and density, but reduced annual and bare ground cover. Vine density was reduced by Lonicera, especially where deer were excluded. Seedlings of several tree species, the invasive shrub, burning bush [Euonymus alatus (Thunb.) Siebold], and the invasive vine, winter creeper [Euonymous fortunei (Turcz.) Hand.-Maz.], were indicator species of the deer exclosure by Lonicera removal treatment combination. The effect of deer on cover of native species depended on Lonicera treatment: where shrubs were removed, cover was higher where deer were excluded, but where shrubs were present, cover was higher where deer had access. We attribute these interactions to the reduced growth of, and shading by, Lonicera where deer had access and browsed this invasive shrub. Some of these effects were evident in the first 6 yr, but are now larger. Other effects were not evident in the earlier evaluation. These findings inform management of areas with high densities of deer and invasive shrubs palatable to deer. Control of only invasive shrubs will reduce native cover and not improve tree regeneration. Managing only deer will increase woody plants but reduce native cover. Management of both stressors is needed to promote tree regeneration and restoration of plant communities.

AB  - Selective browsing by ungulates alters forest structure and composition, with research suggesting that these effects may be amplified in recently disturbed forests and in novel environments (i.e., introduced ungulates). Though the net effects of herbivory following disturbances on carbon storage in boreal forests are not well understood, they are likely important to inform climate-smart ecosystem management. We conducted observational and experimental (i.e., 24- to 27-year-old paired exclosure-control plots) field studies to determine the effects of non-native moose and common boreal forest disturbances (i.e., fires and insect outbreaks) on total, aboveground, and belowground carbon storage in Newfoundland, Canada. We measured carbon stocks at 46 plots in the field and used published allometric equations to estimate the carbon stored in trees, deadwood, woody shrubs, saplings, herbaceous plants, ground vegetation, and roots. We also collected samples of forest litter and organic soil layers for analysis of carbon content. We then fit a suite of generalized linear models to assess the effects of disturbances and moose herbivory on carbon storage. Using our observational data, we found that total carbon stored was highest in mature forests (198.18 +/- 136.77 kg C/9 m(2); mean +/- SD), compared to insect-disturbed (57.47 +/- 30.72 kg C/9 m(2)) and previously burned (42.57 +/- 34.28 kg C/9 m(2)) areas. We found further evidence of this using our experimental data, as aboveground carbon storage was reduced in disturbed forests. Although, on average, exclosures stored more carbon (133.54 +/- 134.69 kg C/9 m(2); mean +/- SD) than their paired controls (95.23 +/- 66.94 kg C/9 m(2)), we did not detect a statistically significant effect of moose presence on carbon storage after 24-27 years of exclusion. We also did not find a relationship between moose density and carbon storage in our observational data. Overall, we demonstrated that forest disturbances are a key driver of carbon storage and that moose effects on carbon storage are highly variable across the landscape. We recommend that future research be done in areas having consistent ungulate management and long-term population data and that detailed plant community data be collected to better understand the roles of ungulate density and plant palatability on carbon storage.

AB  - Fire and herbivores alter vegetation structure and function. Future fire activity is predicted to increase, and quantifying changes in vegetation communities arising from post-fire herbivory is needed to better manage natural environments. We investigated the effects of post-fire herbivory on understory plant communities in a coastal eucalypt forest in southeastern Australia. We quantified herbivore activity, understory plant diversity, and dominant plant morphology following a wildfire in 2017 using two sizes of exclosures. Statistical analysis incorporated the effect of exclusion treatments, time since fire, and the effect of a previous prescribed burn. Exclusion treatments altered herbivore activity, but time since fire did not. Herbivory reduced plant species richness, diversity, and evenness and promoted the dominance of the most abundant plants within the understory. Increasing time since fire reduced community diversity and evenness and influenced morphological changes to the dominant understory plant species, increasing size and dead material while decreasing abundance. We found the legacy effects of a previous prescribed burn had no effect on herbivores or vegetation within our study. Foraging by large herbivores resulted in a depauperate vegetation community. As post-fire herbivory can alter vegetation communities, we postulate that management burning practices may exacerbate herbivore impacts. Future fire management strategies to minimize herbivore-mediated alterations to understory vegetation could include aggregating management burns into larger fire sizes or linking fire management with herbivore management. Restricting herbivore access following fire (planned or otherwise) can encourage a more diverse and species-rich understory plant community. Future research should aim to determine how vegetation change from post-fire herbivory contributes to future fire risk.

AB  - Trophic rewilding is increasingly applied in restoration efforts, with the aim of reintroducing the ecological functions provided by large-bodied mammals and thereby promote self-regulating, biodiverse ecosystems. However, empirical evidence for the effects of megafauna introductions on the abundance and richness of other organisms such as plants and invertebrates, and the mechanisms involved still need strengthening. In this study, we use environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of dung from co-existing feral cattle and horses to assess the seasonal variation in plant diet and dung-associated arthropods and nematodes. We found consistently high diet richness of horses, with low seasonal variability, while the generally lower dietary diversity of cattle increased substantially during summer. Intriguingly, season-specific diets differed, with a greater proportion of trees in the horses' diet during winter, where cattle relied more on shrubs. Graminoids were predominantly found in the diet of horses, but were generally underrepresented compared to previous studies, possibly due to the high prevalence of forbs in the study area. Dung-associated arthropod richness was higher for cattle, largely due to a high richness of flies during summer. Several species of dung-associated arthropods were found primarily in dung from one of the two herbivores, and our data confirmed known patterns of seasonal activity. Nematode richness was constantly higher for horses, and nematode communities were markedly different between the two species. Our results demonstrate complementary effects of cattle and horses through diet differences and dung-associated invertebrate communities, enhancing our understanding of large herbivore effects on vegetation and associated biodiversity. These results are directly applicable for decision-making in rewilding projects, suggesting biodiversity-benefits by inclusion of functionally different herbivores.

AB  - Semiarid Patagonia represents 25% of the rangeland area in Argentina, and sheep overgrazing has degraded about a third of it in the past. In this century, depleted domestic stocks have mostly stabilized, but Guanaco populations have grown. These native camelids share habitat and diets with sheep, but their effect on vegetation is poorly understood and has long been debated. We set up an exclusion experiment in Monte Le & oacute;n and Ca & ntilde;ad & oacute;n Vaca, a semiarid shrubland grassland in southern Patagonia, currently grazed only by guanacos. Vegetation baselines were studied in 2016 in twelve plots, and half of them were protected from guanaco grazing. Thirty-six plots were cleared to study revegetation. Vegetation was reassessed in 2021, and changes were evaluated using a paired t-test. Within protected plots, vegetation cover increased, bare soil diminished, and vegetated patches grew in size, but the density of the patch-interpatch arrangement did not change. Biodiversity, measured by richness and the Shannon-Wiener (SW) index, grew significantly. Nutrient recycling increased, as did the Stability and Infiltration Land Function indexes, although these last differences were not significant. Vegetation cover under guanaco grazing also increased, mainly due to the growth of dwarf shrubs, a typical tendency in sheep grazing-induced transitions in the region. Vegetated patches under grazing fragmented, resulting in smaller patches and denser patch structures, while diversity and land function indexes remained unchanged. Young plants established in cleared plots without guanacos showed higher cover density and individual size. These effects are similar to those observed in numerous experimental sheep exclosures. Guanaco grazing may thus prevent restoration and contribute to the generalized land degradation processes that overgrazing has been causing in Patagonia for over a century.

AB  - Mammalian herbivores have large-scale impacts on vegetation, altering structure, and species composition, especially in tropical grasslands and savannas. However, there is limited understanding of the potential impacts of mammalian herbivores in tropical wet forests, where they are typically less abundant. We investigated the effects of an introduced mammalian herbivore chital (Axis axis) on vegetation structure, composition and leaf functional traits of tropical evergreen forests of the Andaman Islands, India. Across seven islands, representing a gradient of herbivore densities, increasing chital presence was associated with decreased understory richness, understory density and adult tree richness, but was not related to adult tree density or size class distributions. We also found a significant decrease in community level leaf palatability traits (specific leaf area decreased and leaf thickness increased) with increasing chital habitat use. This community level shift in leaf trait values was better explained by intraspecific variation in leaf traits across islands rather than changes in species composition. In summary, we show persistent long-term impacts of an introduced mammalian herbivore on understory tropical tree communities although there is little impact on adult tree communities. Our results also show that functional traits of species can be altered in response to novel herbivory, even at herbivore densities where there are no detectable impacts on adult forest structure or composition. Such altered functional traits may potentially alter ecosystem functioning in these forests even without changes in vegetation structure. Abstract in Hindi is available with online material.

AB  - Large herbivores are often classed as ecosystem engineers, and when they become scarce or overabundant, this can alter ecosystem states and influence climate forcing potentials. This realization has spurred a call to integrate large herbivores in earth system models. However, we lack a good understanding of their net effects on climate forcing, including carbon and energy exchange. A possible solution to this lies in harmonizing data across the myriad of large herbivore exclosure experiments around the world. This is challenging due to differences in experimental designs and field protocols. We used airborne laser scanning (ALS) to describe the effect of herbivore removal across 43 young boreal forest stands in Norway and found that exclusion caused the canopy height to increase from 1.7 +/- 0.2 to 2.5 +/- 0.2 m (means +/- sE), and also causing a marked increase in vertical complexity and above-ground biomass. We then go on to discuss some of the issues with using ALS; we propose ALS as an approach for studying the effects of multiple large herbivore exclosure experiments simultaneously, and producing area-based estimates on canopy structure and forest biomass in a cheap, efficient, standardized and reproducible way. We suggest that this is a vital next step towards generating biome-wide predictions for the effects of large herbivores on forest ecosystem structure which can both inform both local management goals and earth system models.

AB  - Background and Aims The role of deer (family Cervidae) in ecosystem functioning has traditionally been neglected by forest ecologists due to the animal's scarcity in most parts of the northern hemisphere. However, the dramatic rebound in deer populations throughout the 20th century has brought deer browsing to the forefront of forest ecological questioning. Today there is ample evidence that deer affect tree regeneration, understorey plant and animal diversity, and even litter decomposition. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of deer on forest ecosystems remain unclear. Among others, the relative role of abiotic factors versus biotic interactions (e.g. herbivory) in shaping plant assemblages remains largely unknown.
   Methods We used a large-scale experiment with exclosures distributed along abiotic gradients to understand the role of black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitchensis) on the forest understorey on the Haida Gwaii archipelago (western Canada), a unique context where most of the key ecological effects of deer presence have already been intensively studied.
   Key Results Our results demonstrate that 20 years of deer exclusion resulted in a clear increase in vascular plant richness, diversity and cover, and caused a decline in bryophyte cover. Exclusion also unveiled abiotic (i.e. soil water availability and fertility) filtering of plant assemblages that would otherwise have been masked by the impact of abundant deer populations. However, deer exclusion did not lead to an increase in beta diversity, probably because some remnant species had a competitive advantage to regrow after decades of over browsing.
   Conclusions We demonstrated that long-term herbivory by deer can be a dominant factor structuring understorey plant communities that overwhelms abiotic factors. However, while exclosures prove useful to assess the overall effects of large herbivores, the results from our studies at broader scales on the Haida Gwaii archipelago suggest that exclosure experiments should be used cautiously when inferring the mechanisms at work.

AB  - The goal of this study was to evaluate to what extent wild ungulates (fallow deer) can contribute to the maintenance of semi-natural calcareous grasslands, which are a threatened habitat type (natura 2000 code *6210). In a 10-year exclosure experiment, we tested the effects of ungulate foraging using three treatments: (A) control with combined foraging of herded sheep and wild fallow deer, (B) sheep exclosure with only deer foraging and (C) total exclosure with no foraging. Treatments not grazed by sheep (B, C) were characterized by significantly declining species numbers, litter accumulation and shrub encroachment. Despite high population densities, the effect of fallow deer alone (B) was weak: Succession of woody species was only partly inhibited, while annuals, short-growing and rosette-building plant species were strongly suppressed by litter accumulation. Only the combination of sheep and fallow deer foraging preserved vegetation structure and species richness and led to a promotion of target species. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that we need to continue the traditional land-use forms such as sheep grazing in order to maintain calcareous grasslands. However, we should also raise our awareness for wild animals and analyse more in depth their potential contribution to the conservation management of open habitats.

AB  - Soil disturbances caused by large animals impact soil biodiversity and potentially alter forest ecosystem functioning and productivity. However, most studies have focused on the effects of wild boar infestations on aboveground vegetation and soil physical and chemical properties. Little is known about the influence of wild boar grubbing on the soil faunal community within forested ecosystems. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a long-term (10-year) exclosure experiment to investigate the responses of soil nematode communities to wild boar grubbing and seasonal variations in a broad-leaved Korean pine forest in Changbai Mountain, China. The results indicated that wild boar grubbing did not significantly impact soil nematode abundance, genus richness, diversity indices (Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Simpson index, and evenness index), and ecological indices (enrichment index, channel index, structural index, and basal index). However, we observed that grubbing reduced the relative abundance of plant parasites while increased that of bacterivores and the maturity index (MI), leading to changes in nematode community composition. Notably, the influence of grubbing was more pronounced in the spring than in the autumn. Although season itself did not significantly affect soil nematode genus richness and diversity indices, it did affect soil nematode relative abundance, bacterivores, omnivorespredators, plant parasites, K-strategistis, r-strategistis, MI, enrichment index, and channel index. Long-term wild boar grubbing appeared to mitigate seasonal effects on soil nematode communities, resulting in higher MI and increased stability in nematode community abundance. Our findings suggest that changes in soil parameters, such as soil NH4+, soil pH, and soil NO3-, likely mediate the observed impact of wild boars on the soil nematode community. In summary, our study demonstrated that wild boar grubbing altered the structure of soil nematode communities, albeit with seasonal variations, indicating that the effects of wild boar activity on forest soil ecosystems influence biogeochemical cycles through changes in nematode community composition rather than nematode genera richness.

AB  - Questions: Herbivores change plant communities and biogeochemical cycles by changing species composition and soil organic matter contents through different mechanisms. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of livestock removal on plant species composition and soil organic matter stocks in savannas of the R & iacute;o de la Plata grasslands. Locations: A subtropical savanna in R & iacute;o Negro, Uruguay. Methods: The experiment consisted of a paired grazing exclusion randomized block design with five sites, where livestock was excluded for 29 years. We recorded differences in plant species composition in different strata and extracted soil cores to analyze soil carbon and nitrogen stocks, and delta(13) carbon contents in two different soil organic matter fractions. Results: Long-term livestock removal reduced plant species richness and diversity, altered the floristic composition and facilitated native-shrub encroachment. Grazing exclusion modified the relative frequency of plant functional types and reduced summer-growing grasses. We recorded 45 species common to both grazing and exclosure treatments, while 19 were present only in exclosure sites and 39 only in grazed sites. Livestock exclusion had a differential effect on soil organic matter formation, increased soil organic carbon and nitrogen stocks in the mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) but tended to slightly reduce them in the particulate organic matter fraction (POM). Grazing removal modified the C-3/C-4 species cover and these differences were reflected in the delta C-13 contents of both POM and MAOM fractions. Conclusions: Removal of domestic herbivores increased shrub abundance, decreased plant species richness and diversity but increased total carbon and nitrogen contents in soil organic matter. Our results suggest that grazed and exclosure areas should be combined mosaically in the landscape to maximize plant species diversity and soil organic carbon sequestration.

AB  - In grassland ecosystems, grazing by large herbivores is a highly influential process that affects biodiversity by modifying the vegetative environment through selective consumption. Here, we test whether restoration of bison is associated with increased bird diversity and cervid occupancy in networks of riparian habitat within a temperate grassland ecosystem, mixed-grass prairie in northcentral Montana, United States. We used a long time-series of remote sensing imagery to examine changes in riparian vegetation structure in stream networks within bison and cattle pastures. We then assessed how vegetation structure influenced diversity of bird communities and detection rates of mammals in these same riparian networks. We found that percent cover of woody vegetation, and native grasses and forbs increased more rapidly over time in bison pastures, and that these changes in vegetation structure were associated with increased bird diversity and cervid occupancy. In conclusion, bison reintroduction appears to function as a passive riparian restoration strategy with positive diversity outcomes for birds and mammals.

AB  - Ungulate browsing is a key disturbance process influencing forest structure and composition, with the potential to alter forest resilience following canopy disturbance. We examined the effects of l5 years of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and moose (Alces alces americana) browsing in regenerating temperate forests of the northeastern U.S. We tested the alternative hypotheses that woody vegetation is (1) resilient to browsing, with structure and composition similar after stems have grown above the browser trap or (2) altered by browsing, resulting in long-term legacy effects. Three browser treatments-ungulate exclusion, deer, and deer + moose-were established in seven clear-cut stands. Basal area and species diversity did not differ significantly among treatments after 15 years, indicating resilience, whereas the abundance of two tree species was altered: pin cherry (Prunus pensylvanica) was lower by 3-fold in deer + moose plots, while white pine (Pinus strobus) was greater by over 5-fold. Forb cover was half as abundant in deer + moose plots compared to ungulate exclusion, while forb richness remained unaffected. Our results suggest that ungulate browsing during stand initiation can alter successional trajectories while still being compatible with long-term forest resilience; however, there are potential trade-offs between woody plant resilience and the vigor of the herbaceous layer when large herbivores are present. With relatively small long-term effects on structure and diversity and by accelerating succession towards longer-lived tree species, deer + moose browsing in northern temperate forests may be less of a management concern than is generally assumed.

AB  - Both termites and large mammalian herbivores (LMH) are savanna ecosystem engineers that have profound impacts on ecosystem structure and function. Both of these savanna engineers modulate many common and shared dietary resources such as woody and herbaceous plant biomass, yet few studies have addressed how they impact one another. In particular, it is unclear how herbivores may influence the abundance of long-lived termite mounds via changes in termite dietary resources such as woody and herbaceous biomass. While it has long been assumed that abundance and areal cover of termite mounds in the landscape remain relatively stable, most data are observational, and few experiments have tested how termite mound patterns may respond to biotic factors such as changes in large herbivore communities. Here, we use a broad tree density gradient and two landscape-scale experimental manipulations-the first a multi-guild large herbivore exclosure experiment (20 years after establishment) and the second a tree removal experiment (8 years after establishment)-to demonstrate that patterns in Odontotermes termite mound abundance and cover are unexpectedly dynamic. Termite mound abundance, but areal cover not significantly, is positively associated with experimentally controlled presence of cattle, but not wild mesoherbivores (15-1,000 kg) or megaherbivores (elephants and giraffes). Herbaceous productivity and tree density, termite dietary resources that are significantly affected by different LMH treatments, are both positive predictors of termite mound abundance. Experimental reductions of tree densities are associated with lower abundances of termite mounds. These results reveal a richly interacting web of relationships among multiple savanna ecosystem engineers and suggest that termite mound abundance and areal cover are intimately tied to herbivore-driven resource availability.

AB  - Overabundant Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer) are a threat to forest regeneration due to browse on seedlings of preferred species. We investigated the deer-management program of Cincinnati Parks (Ohio) to determine if controlled hunting reduced deer density enough to facilitate tree regeneration. We surveyed seedlings, saplings, trees, palatable herbs, and invasive shrubs in 5 sites. In all sites, sapling densities were <1000/ha, thus insufficient for forest regeneration. Four sites had seedling densities >2500/ha, considered sufficient for regeneration. However, when taxa that cannot contribute to future canopies (Fraxinus [ash], Asimina triloba [Pawpaw]) were excluded, all sites were below the density necessary for regeneration. Species preferred by White-tailed Deer were common in the canopy of the forests, but sparse in the seedling and sapling layers, suggesting deer will shift tree species composition. Sites also had low cover of herb species preferred by deer. Among sites, reduction of palatable herb cover was significantly associated with both recent deer density and invasive shrub cover, while tree-seedling density showed a negative trend with deer density. Our findings indicate management has not decreased deer populations sufficiently in the Cincinnati Parks to promote vegetation regeneration. Deer exclusion or underplanting of protected tree seedlings are needed to facilitate tree regeneration.

AB  - Questions Livestock grazing is an important driver of plant diversity in grasslands. Different mechanisms summarized in three main hypotheses have been proposed to explain its varying effects depending on productivity. The insufficient compensation hypothesis (ICH) states that livestock causes the extinction of species that cannot compensate for biomass removal in unproductive sites, reducing species richness. The competitive release hypothesis (CRH) states that livestock increases plant diversity by attenuating competition, especially in productive environments. In the convergent evolution hypothesis (CEH), livestock has minor effects on diversity in unproductive sites because plants that endure stress are pre-adapted to grazing. These hypotheses have rarely been compared formally, and have mostly been tested on large spatial scales. Here we simultaneously test these hypotheses on a local scale. Location Natural semi-arid grassland, Oaxaca, Mexico. Methods We performed a long-term exclosure experiment, recording plant diversity annually over 17 years. In 2017 we measured species richness over a grazing intensity gradient. We used linear mixed-effects models, nestedness and beta-diversity analyses to evaluate diversity and composition in relation to grazing and productivity. Results Plant diversity generally increased with grazing intensity. In line with CRH, species richness increased as grazing became more intensive due to a progressive incorporation of increasingly poor competitors to the community, with a seemingly stronger effect under high productivity. This suggests that herbivores limit competitive species and prevent competitive exclusion. ICH may play a secondary role because the effect was reversed in low productivity inside exclosures. Conclusions Our finding implies that in productive sites, the exclusion of livestock can be detrimental to plant diversity as a lack of grazing accelerates competitive exclusion. By contrast, in limiting environments, grazing can preserve diversity if livestock are kept at low stocking densities. Our results show that small-scale variations in productivity need to be considered when designing livestock management.

AB  - Herbivore exclusion is implemented globally to recover ecosystems from grazing by introduced and native herbivores, but evidence for large-scale biodiversity benefits is inconsistent in arid ecosystems. We examined the effects of livestock exclusion on dryland plant richness and reproductive capacity. We collected data on plant species richness and seeding (reproductive capacity), rainfall, vegetation productivity and cover, soil strength and herbivore grazing intensity from 68 sites across 6500 km(2) of arid Georgina gidgee (Acacia georginae) woodlands in central Australia between 2018 and 2020. Sites were on an actively grazed cattle station and two destocked conservation reserves. We used structural equation modeling to examine indirect (via soil or vegetation modification) versus direct (herbivory) effects of grazing intensity by two introduced herbivores (cattle, camels) and a native herbivore (red kangaroo), on seasonal plant species richness and seeding of all plants, and the richness and seeding of four plant groups (native grasses, forbs, annual chenopod shrubs, and palatable perennial shrubs). Non-native herbivores had a strong indirect effect on plant richness and seeding by reducing vegetative ground cover, resulting in decreased richness and seeding of native grasses and forbs. Herbivores also had small but negative direct impacts on plant richness and seeding. This direct effect was explained by reductions in annual chenopod and palatable perennial shrub richness under grazing activity. Responses to grazing were herbivore-dependent; introduced herbivore grazing reduced native plant richness and seeding, while native herbivore grazing had no significant effect on richness or seeding of different plant functional groups. Soil strength decreased under grazing by cattle but not camels or kangaroos. Cattle had direct effects on palatable perennial shrub richness and seeding, whereas camels had indirect effects, reducing richness and seeding by reducing the abundance of shrubs. We show that considering indirect pathways improves evaluations of the effects of disturbances on biodiversity, as focusing only on direct effects can mask critical mechanisms of change. Our results indicate substantial biodiversity benefits from excluding livestock and controlling camels in drylands. Reducing introduced herbivore impacts will improve soil and vegetation condition, ensure reproduction and seasonal persistence of species, and protect native plant diversity.

AB  - Past and current anthropogenic practices have resulted in dramatic alterations to ungulate population densities worldwide. When ungulate populations are overabundant, they can alter the dynamics, structure, and function of ecosystems. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), specifically, can occur at densities far greater than their historical records in parts of their native range, which includes forests in the northeastern U.S. They have been shown to alter community structure of native plants, indirectly impact animal communities, and promote the success of invasive species. Despite much research into the effects of overabundant ungulates and deer in particular, less is known about the effects of deer on soil microbial communities. Here, we utilized soil samples from inside and outside of six deer exclosures located in a regional second growth mixed hardwood forest on the Binghamton University campus in Vestal NY, USA. A metagenomic analysis was conducted on DNA extracted from the soil to identify the microbes present. Soil characteristics, including soil organic matter, soil moisture, pH, and electrical conductivity were also measured. Soil samples from inside exclosures had on average lower pH, higher soil moisture and organic matter, and higher electrical conductivity. The microbial communities across all samples were dominated by Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria. However, the structure of the microbial soil community appeared to differ between samples taken inside and outside the exclosures, with those taken outside more closely resembling other outside samples and those sampled inside soils showing more variability in community structure. Overall, our results suggest that overabundant deer may have a homogenization effect on the soil abiotic environment and the soil microbial community.

AB  - Disturbance regimes, like low-intensity fire, canopy gaps and ungulate browsing, play a critical role in determining ecological composition and structure in temperate forests around the world. Each disturbance (or lack thereof) can lead to unique plant communities, but we do not understand how combined disturbances change plant diversity and the resulting soil seed bank. Changes in the soil seed bank, which depend on the plants that survive post-disturbance, can then influence future biodiversity and succession. We used a long-term experiment in West Virginia, USA, that factorially manipulated low-intensity fire, deer exclusion and canopy gaps. Thirteen years after disturbance initiation, we sampled the seed bank from each disturbance treatment. We found that low-intensity fire led to increased seed bank density, with additional canopy gaps and deer exclusion each creating unique seed bank communities. Combined fire, canopy gaps and deer presence led to high seed bank diversity and the most unique seed communities, while canopy gaps and deer had no effect on seed banks unless the area was previously burned. In contrast, combined fire, canopy gaps and deer exclusion led to the lowest seed bank diversity of all treatments, reflecting the continued legacy of extant plants that grew immediately after disturbance. Seed communities were also distinct from extant understory species over 13 years, regardless of disturbance treatment. Each reintroduced disturbance combination left a unique legacy in the seed bank that will likely influence future forest reorganization following disturbances, adding to our understanding of how multiple disturbances influence forest succession and organization. Synthesis. Forest disturbance regimes have changed around the world and are being restored or manipulated to support biodiversity. Reintroduction of disturbance leads to unique plant communities, but we do not understand how combined disturbances change the soil seed bank. Using an experiment that manipulates low-intensity fire, canopy gaps and deer exclusion, we find that combinations of these experimental treatments leads to substantially different seed communities. These disturbance-altered seed banks will likely influence future biodiversity and successional patterns, highlighting how the restoration of disturbance can strongly and indirectly influence temperate forest community dynamics.

AB  - Climate models predict increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme-weather events. The impacts of these events may be modulated by biotic agents in unpredictable ways, yet few experiments cover sufficient spatiotemporal scales to measure the interactive effects of multiple extreme events. We used 15 years of a 28-year experiment spanning several significant droughts to investigate how rainfall, large herbivores, and soil-engineering termites affect understorey vegetation in a semi-arid savanna. Herbivory was the dominant influence on community structure-decreasing cover, increasing species richness, and favouring occurrence of annuals relative to perennials-but these effects were contingent on rainfall and termitaria in non-additive (hence unpredictable) ways. A separate experiment showed that resource enrichment, mimicking the effects of termitaria, does not straightforwardly compensate for top-down effects of herbivory. Synthesis. Our study highlights the potency of top-down forcing in African savannas. It suggests impressive robustness to drought and underscores the value of multi-decadal experiments for studying interactions among multiple drivers of ecosystem dynamics.

AB  - To elucidate the effects of modification of the understory aboveground plant biomass and soil nutrient and moisture environments on canopy tree growth in deer overabundance sites, we compared the canopy shoot growth of oak trees (Quercus crispula), which are not a target for bark stripping or bark feeding by deer, understory aboveground plant biomass, and components of soil nutrient and moisture between inside (protected) and outside (exposed) a large fenced area. We found that canopy shoot growth in the exposed area was reduced compared with that in the protected area. Net nitrogen (N) mineralization rates did not differ between areas, although understory aboveground plant biomass, total carbon (C) and N, and total soil inorganic N content were significantly lower in the exposed area than in the protected area. Indices of canopy shoot growth correlated significantly with soil water content, but due to the limited scope of our study this result does not confirm an effect of soil moisture on canopy shoot growth. Further study is required to clarify the effects of deer overabundance on canopy tree growth.

AB  - Large and small mammalian herbivores are present in most vegetated areas in the Arctic and often have large impacts on plant community composition and ecosystem functioning. The relative importance of different herbivores and especially how their specific impact on the vegetation varies across the Arctic is however poorly understood. Here, we investigate how large and small herbivores influence vegetation density and plant community composition in four arctic vegetation types in Scandinavia and Alaska. We used a unique set of exclosures, excluding only large (reindeer and muskoxen) or all mammalian herbivores (also voles and lemmings) for at least 20 years. We found that mammalian herbivores in general decreased leaf area index, NDVI, and abundance of vascular plants in all four locations, even though the strength of the effect and which herbivore type caused these effects differed across locations. In three locations, herbivore presence caused contrasting plant communities, but not in the location with lowest productivity. Large herbivores had a negative effect on plant height, whereas small mammalian herbivores increased species diversity by decreasing dominance of the initially dominating plant species. Above- or belowground disturbances caused by herbivores were found to play an important role in shaping the vegetation in all locations. Synthesis: Based on these results, we conclude that both small and large mammalian herbivores influence vegetation in Scandinavia and Alaska in a similar way, some of which can mitigate effects of climate change. We also see important differences across locations, but these depend rather on local herbivore and plant community composition than large biogeographical differences among continents.

AB  - The replacement of grasses by shrubs or bare ground (xerification) is a primary form of landscape change in drylands globally with consequences for ecosystem services. The potential for wild herbivores to trigger or reinforce shrubland states may be underappreciated, however, and comparative analyses across herbivore taxa are sparse. We sought to clarify the relative effects of domestic cattle, native rodents, native lagomorphs, and exotic African oryx (Oryx gazella) on a Chihuahuan Desert grassland undergoing shrub encroachment. We then asked whether drought periods, wet season precipitation, or interspecific grass-shrub competition modified herbivore effects to alter plant cover, species diversity, or community composition. We established a long-term experiment with hierarchical herbivore exclosure treatments and surveyed plant foliar cover over 25 years. Cover of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) proliferated, responding primarily to climate, and was unaffected by herbivore treatments. Surprisingly, cattle and African oryx exclusion had only marginal effects on perennial grass cover at their current densities. Native lagomorphs interacted with climate to limit perennial grass cover during wet periods. Native rodents strongly decreased plant diversity, decreased evenness, and altered community composition. Overall, we found no evidence of mammalian herbivores facilitating or inhibiting shrub encroachment, but native small mammals interacting with climate drove dynamics of herbaceous plant communities. Ongoing monitoring will determine whether increased perennial grass cover from exclusion of native lagomorphs and rodents slows the transition to a dense shrubland.

AB  - Disruptive effects have been described on the plants and ecosystems of oceanic islands due to the introduction of invasive herbivores. In the Canary Islands the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.) was introduced five centuries ago and currently is widespread in all ecosystems, although in the laurel forests it is very scarce. However, on Morello-Ericetum woodland mostly represented by disturbed laurel forest areas, rabbit density is higher. Here we analyzed the impact of rabbits on the Morello-Ericetum woodland using exclusion and control plots located in 11 sites in the Garajonay National Park (La Gomera Island). Rabbit browsing was assessed for 36 endemic species, 15 of them threatened, which were sowed in both control and exclusion plots. After three years of monitoring, our results show a significant negative effect on the establishment and seedling recruitment for 55% of the analyzed species, especially in summer when the rabbit density increases by nearly 30%. Also, plant growth (in 91% of the species) and flowering rate (36% of the species), were disrupted, which could cause a depletion of the seed bank. Among the five tree species included in the experiment, three were also significantly damaged, so rabbits could be even influencing canopy species, delaying forest recovery. The management of Morello-Ericetum woodland should be countered the effects produced by the rabbits on their tree composition, and to allow the development of an understory where endemic species recover their abundance.

AB  - Plant-herbivore interactions account for much of the biodiversity observed in an ecosystem. Plants may alter defense expression dependent on the specific herbivore present. Many studies focus on the optimization of these defenses against a single herbivore, but in an ecological context, there may be a myriad of herbivores at any given time. We designed a study to examine defenses employed by swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor) against insects and large mammals. We established six deer exclosures with trees located inside and outside each exclosure. Outside the exclosures, physical constraints only allow deer to feed up to a browseline on trees, whereas insects can potentially access all portions of the tree. Trees inside exclosures were only accessible to insect herbivores. Furthermore, insecticides were applied to half of the exclosures to create insect-free (i.e., insecticide applied), deer-free (i.e., inside exclosures), deer-only (i.e., outside exclosures with insecticide), and herbivore-free (i.e., inside exclosures with insecticide) environments. This design allowed us to analyze simultaneous defensive responses of individual trees to mammal and insect herbivores. We predicted that because insects represent a continuous threat, plants should invest in fixed concentrations of defenses (e.g., polyphenols, tannins, and condensed tannins), even when deer are absent. When deer are present, plants should increase investment in defenses in tissues that deer have access to. We found that plant defense strategies varied spatially on individual trees. When only insects were present, nutritional constituents (e.g., nitrogen and non-structural carbohydrates) did not change but antinutritional constituents increased. Contrastingly, when deer were present, both nutritional and antinutritional constituents decreased. We found a decrease in insect functional group diversity when deer were present. Our findings suggest that plants may partition defense strategies depending on the most prominent herbivore pressure. However, changes in insect functional group diversity may result from either changes in plant defense strategy or intraspecific competition among multiple herbivores. Future studies should investigate patterns of chemical heterogeneity displayed by plants in response to diverse herbivore pressures.

AB  - Ecological resilience to ungulate overbrowsing is an important issue in forest ecosystems. After chronic herbivory, the recovery rate of understory vegetation and its related functions can be slow even with decreasing grazing intensity; thus, detecting elasticity during alternative successional trajectories is fundamental to understanding state perturbations. In this context, we focused on physical plant-soil feedback (functional interactions between plant growth and soil physical conditions) and evaluated elasticity and recovery processes according to deer density. The effects of 40 years of chronic herbivory by sika deer (average density 14.7 individuals km(-2)) on the recovery of understory plant communities and associated changes in soil physical properties in headwater catchments were assessed. Using 8 years of catchment-wide exclusion (fenced) and reduction (only culled; average 4.3 individuals km(-2)) treatments, plot sampling was conducted in 2010 (before treatment) and 2018 (after treatment). The recovery of vegetation and soil physical properties were evaluated, and functional plant-soil relationships and spatial variability were assessed to detect recovery processes during alternative successional trajectory. Woody species increased only under the exclusion treatment and the average soil bulk density was lower than that under reduction treatments. Soil bulk density was negatively correlated with root biomass in the fenced catchment, and root biomass was positively associated with woody species richness. Reduced soil bulk density (similar to 0.5 g cm(-3)) was observed with greater root biomass and woody species richness on upper hillslopes in the deer-excluded catchment where plant coverage was minimal. Successional failure under the reduction treatment suggested slow recovery with a depressed threshold according to deer density, indicating a clockwise hysteretic response to deer density. Unlike plant coverage during the earlier period of overbrowsing, woody species root development led the recovery of functional physical plant-soil feedback; however, this was probably limited by the higher soil erosion rate in riparian areas and an under-developed herb layer. Our results highlight an alternative recovery trajectory of physical plant-soil feedback driven by an alternative plant element (woody roots) to recovery trajectory with increasing plant cover. However, riparian erosion and herb layer would still suppress recovery. Therefore, recovery might be slower at the landscape scale.

AB  - Rangeland management has traditionally focused on the grazing effects of livestock, or on wild ungulates because they are potential competitors with livestock. However, herbivory by smaller herbivores, such as lagomorphs, could play a much greater role in shaping the plant community than is commonly thought. Being selective feeders with high mass-specific metabolic rates, we hypothesized that lagomorphs impose an herbivory regime on the rangeland that differs from that of ungulates and drives the plant community toward a different composition. We used an 8-year exclosure experiment with three plot types (complete exclosure, partial exclosure, open rangeland), each 5.95 m2, to separate the effects of grazing by lagomorphs (jackrabbits and cottontails) from the effects of the large grazers (mainly cattle and bison) on vegetation structure and plant community composition. We replicated the experiment across 20 sites in a semiarid rangeland in the western US. The plant community in the complete exclosure plots (lagomorphs and ungulates excluded) developed a fivefold greater standing crop of grass than the open rangeland but supported the lowest biomass, density, and aerial cover of forbs. Partial exclosure plots (ungulates excluded, lagomorphs included) developed a community with higher forb phytomass (33.6% increase relative to open rangeland) and lower forb species richness (16.4% decrease relative to open rangeland). This effect was mainly caused by the encroachment of noxious weeds, including Salsola tragus (prickly Russian thistle/tumbleweed), which covered up to 37% of the ground in plots that lagomorphs had exclusive access to. We infer that selective grazing by lagomorphs facilitates noxious weeds that are elsewhere controlled to some extent by (a) the coarse grazing and trampling effects of large ungulates and (b) competition with native herbaceous species. For semiarid rangelands that have been degraded by livestock grazing, our complete and partial exclosures show that a reduction in stocking rate might not return the rangeland to its former state due to a hysteresis effect resulting from the facilitation of noxious weeds by lagomorphs. Rangeland management should be informed by an understanding of the entire food web, which includes the direct and indirect grazing effects of small herbivores such as lagomorphs.

AB  - Tidal marsh plant communities in the Pacific Northwest are characterized by tall, perennial graminoids (TPGs), which provide forage for herbivores such as Canada geese. Excessive grazing by Canada geese leads to loss of marsh habitat, and removal of grazing pressure is required for the vegetation to recover. Grazing exclosures (fences) are used to allow time and space for vegetation to recover following intensive herbivory; however, their effects on native plant community recovery has not been tested. Generalized linear models were used to compare TPG abundance in aboveground vegetation and surface seed banks in 1-year-old and 10-year-old exclosures at Nanaimo River Estuary (NRE) and Little Qualicum River Estuary (LQRE), respectively, to areas of the marshes that had no known history of grazing (undisturbed) and areas still actively grazed (grubbed). Compared to undisturbed sites, grubbed sites had 187.3% less mean TPG vegetation cover and 190.7% lower proportion of TPG seeds. The 1-year-old exclosures at NRE had 105.0% less mean TPG vegetation cover and 193.2% lower proportion of TPG seeds. The 10-year-old exclosures at LQRE had 7.0% greater mean TPG cover and 55.7% greater proportion of TPG seed than all undisturbed sites; however, these exclosures had 110.0% greater mean relative abundance of non-native TPGs than undisturbed sites. These results indicate vegetation may not recover towards comparable historic conditions through grazing exclusion alone, and that active restoration methods may be required following intensive grazing, especially in estuaries where the vegetation community and surface seed bank has a high abundance of non-native, invasive species.

AB  - Spiders play a key role in forest food webs, where they regulate decomposer populations and may act as predators of pests and disease vectors. Spider community composition is determined in part by vegetation structure. Therefore, the exclusion of large mammals, such as deer and wild boar, through wildlife fencing may affect the composition of spider communities and their prey in forest ecosystems. Web-building spiders and their prey were hand-collected in plots that had been fenced for three years, as well as adjacent unfenced plots in a mixed temperate forest in north-eastern Germany. Additionally, spiders in the leaf litter were sampled in fenced and unfenced subareas by sieving litter. Wildlife fencing did not significantly affect spider densities or community composition per microhabitat. However, fencing affected the cover of different microhabitats significantly as there was a higher density of larger trees and higher leaflitter cover in fenced plots while there was a higher percentage of bare ground and deadwood in unfenced plots. Spider communities and their prey composition differed significantly between microhabitats (deciduous trees, coniferous trees, dead wood, understory vegetation, leaf litter) independent of fencing. Thysanoptera prey was mainly caught by spiders on coniferous trees and in the understory vegetation. Heteroptera prey were captured most frequently in the understory vegetation while Hymenoptera (excl. Formicidae) prey were mostly caught on deciduous trees. Several spider species showed a preference between deciduous and coniferous trees in the mixed forest. Wildlife fencing alters the vegetation structure of mixed forests and has indirect effects on spider communities and their role in forest food webs due to alteration of microhabitat availability.

AB  - Vegetation type is an important component of savannas contributing to changes in soil health. In savanna landscapes, the tree-grass balance is primarily governed by water, nutrients, fire, herbivory, and their interactions. Here we investigated the long-term effect of herbivores, fire, and vegetation type, and their interactions on selected physical properties (bulk density, penetration resistance, aggregate size fractions, and mean weight diameter (MWD)) of water stable aggregates within the crest and foot-slope of 20-year-old Nkuhlu exclosures located in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Burning, herbivory, and open grassland zones had a significant main and interactive ecological impact on all the soil physical properties under investigation. The interactions between fire, herbivores, and vegetation type within the crest and foot-slope of the Nkuhlu exclosure had a significant impact on soil bulk density, with areas under tree canopies having lower bulk density than open grassland zones in all the exclosures. In all the sampling sites, both burnt and unburnt plots of the full exclosure had lower penetration resistance than the control site and partial exclosure. Moreover, unburnt plots and canopy cover increased aggregate size distribution and mean weight diameter of water stable aggregates. Since fire and herbivory are closely linked and bring about changes in soil physical properties, the understanding of the dynamics of fire, herbivory, vegetation, and their interactions can then be used to help make effective management decisions that incorporate concerns of biodiversity in savanna ecosystems.

AB  - 'Pleistocene rewilding' refers to the concept of restoring ecosystems to their state during the Pleistocene epoch, by (re-)introducing species or their close relatives that were present during that time, in an effort to revive ecological processes that existed before human-driven extinctions. This concept is highly controversial for both ethical and ecological reasons. Here I review evidence of recent northward range expansions of various large land mammals in boreal Eurasia, and discuss whether this provides evidence that rewilding projects might be justified and feasible. Around 100 years ago, the native boreal fauna of Eurasia included five species of large land mammals: moose Alces alces, brown bear Ursus arctos, wolf Canis lupus, reindeer Rangifer tarandus, and snow sheep Ovis nivicola, but since then the list has expanded. This is due to the introduction of bison Bison bonasus, Bison bison, muskox Ovibos moschatus, non-native deer, and feral horses, as well as the northward expansion of wild boar Sus scrofa, roe deer Capreolus capreolus, Capreolus pygargus, and red deer Cervus canadensis. In addition, several southern species temporarily occurred in the north, including tiger Panthera tigris, sika deer Cervus nippon, and yak Bos grunniens. This ongoing enrichment of the boreal fauna is reminiscent to Pleistocene rewilding. However, so far, the abundance of expanding large mammals species remains low. Large-scale projects on Pleistocene rewilding are labor-intensive, expensive, and not popular enough to receive support, and therefore their realization is problematic

AB  - The study evaluates the interactive effects of mammalian herbivores and trees on soil biochemical properties of a semi-arid savanna ecosystem in South Africa. Composite soil samples were collected at three radial distances from a tree base, namely besides the tree trunk, canopy edge, and outside canopy, for two trees (Combretum apiculatum and Grewia bicolor), in the full exclosure and open access area in the Nkuhlu exclosures of Kruger National Park. We measured total nitrogen (TN), total carbon (TC), pH, available phosphorus (P), microbial activity, exchangeable cations (calcium [Ca2+], magnesium [Mg2+], sodium [Na+] and potassium [K+]) and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Result indicates that pH and Mg2+ in full exclosure were significantly higher than outside, whereas TN, TC, available P, microbial activity, K+ and CEC were lower. Under canopy samples had more pH, TN, TC, available P, K+ and Ca2+ than those collected from other sampling zones, mainly because of the effect of litter accumulation under the tree canopies. With the exceptions of CEC and microbial activity, the effects of the two tree species on soil nutrients were similar. Microbial activity was significantly high, whereas CEC was low under G. bicolor than C. apiculatum. The canopy edge of G. bicolor had the highest microbial activity, while the area outside the canopy of C. apiculatum had the lowest than all the other treatments. These results indicate that the presence of herbivores and woody species differentially affects the spatial distribution of the various nutrients, soil microbiota and other chemical properties depending on their radial distances from the tree base.Conservation implications: It is ecologically unwise to completely eliminate trees and herbivores from savanna ecosystems, as they help to maintain soil fertility and biodiversity.

AB  - Fire and herbivory have profound effects on vegetation in savanna ecosystems, but little is known about how different herbivore groups influence vegetation dynamics after fire. We assessed the separate and combined effects of herbivory by cattle and wild meso- and megaherbivores on postfire herbaceous vegetation cover, species richness, and species turnover in a savanna ecosystem in central Kenya. We measured these vegetation attributes for five sampling periods (from 2013 to 2017) in prescribed burns and unburned areas located within a series of replicated long-term herbivore exclosures that allow six different combinations of cattle and wild meso- and megaherbivores (elephants and giraffes). Vegetation cover (grasses, mainly) and species richness were initially reduced by burning but recovered by 15-27 months after fire, suggesting strong resilience to infrequent fire. However, the rates of recovery differed in plots accessible by different wild and domestic herbivore guilds. Wildlife (but not cattle) delayed postfire recovery of grasses, and the absence of wildlife (with or without cattle) delayed recovery of forbs. Herbivory by only cattle increased grass species richness in burned relative to unburned areas. Herbivory by cattle (with or without wildlife), however, reduced forb species richness in burned relative to unburned areas. Herbivory by wild ungulates (but not cattle) increased herbaceous species turnover in burned relative to unburned areas. Megaherbivores had negligible modifying effects on these results. This study demonstrates that savanna ecosystems are remarkably resilient to infrequent fires, but postfire grazing by cattle and wild mesoherbivores exerts different effects on recovery trajectories of herbaceous vegetation.

AB  - Plants in suburban forests of eastern North America face the dual stressors of high white-tailed deer density and invasion by nonindigenous plants. Chronic deer herbivory combined with strong competition from invasive plants could alter a plant's stress- and defense-related secondary chemistry, especially for long-lived juvenile trees in the understory, but this has not been studied. We measured foliar total antioxidants, phenolics, and flavonoids in juveniles of two native trees, Fraxinus pennsylvanica (green ash) and Fagus grandifolia (American beech), growing in six forests in the suburban landscape of central New Jersey, USA. The trees grew in experimental plots subjected for 2.5 years to factorial treatments of deer access/exclosure x addition/no addition of the nonindigenous invasive grass Microstegium vimineum (Japanese stiltgrass). As other hypothesized drivers of plant secondary chemistry, we also measured nonstiltgrass herb layer cover, light levels, and water availability. Univariate mixed model analysis of the deer and stiltgrass effects and multivariate structural equation modeling (SEM) of all variables showed that both greater stiltgrass cover and greater deer pressure induced antioxidants, phenolics, and flavonoids, with some variation between species. Deer were generally the stronger factor, and stiltgrass effects were most apparent at high stiltgrass density. SEM also revealed that soil dryness directly increased the chemicals; deer had additional positive, but indirect, effects via influence on the soil; in beech photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) positively affected flavonoids; and herb layer cover had no effect. Juvenile trees' chemical defense/stress responses to deer and invasive plants can be protective, but also could have a physiological cost, with negative consequences for recruitment to the canopy. Ecological implications for species and their communities will depend on costs and benefits of stress/defense chemistry in the specific environmental context, particularly with respect to invasive plant competitiveness, extent of invasion, local deer density, and deer browse preferences.

AB  - QuestionsWhich are the effects of inter-annual meteorological fluctuations on plant species richness and vegetation dynamics in Mediterranean temporary ponds, shallow wetlands characterized by alternating phases of drought and flooding? Which are the effects of wild boar disturbance? How do the responses of specialist or non-specialist species of the habitat differ?
   LocationNW Sardinia Island (Italy).
   MethodsWe assessed plant cover during six years within one 60 cm x 60 cm quadrat in each of five areas. To measure the effect of inter-annual meteorological fluctuations on vegetation, we used two indices: the evapotranspiration and the synthetic agrometeorological indicator. To quantify the effect of disturbance by boars, we compared two treatments: disturbed and non-disturbed (located outside and inside 1.5 m x 1.5 m exclosures respectively). As a whole, we monitored 60 plots (6 years x 2 treatments x 5 replications). We analyzed data using ANOVA, PERMANOVA and BIO-ENV.
   ResultsPlant species richness and composition showed significant differences between years and treatments. Species composition was correlated with the evapotranspiration before the vegetative peak during the last period and with the agrometeorological indicator during the whole vegetative period. Specialist species showed much weaker growth, quantified as cover, in the drier years. Starting from the third survey year, plant richness and cover of specialist species were significantly higher in disturbed than in not-disturbed plots. The extent of bare soil generally was not affected by the treatment.
   ConclusionsMeteorological fluctuations affect plant species composition and vegetation dynamics in Mediterranean temporary ponds. The sensitivity of specialist species could make them particularly vulnerable to climate change. Nevertheless, they are resilient to unpredictable disturbances such as burrowing by wild boar. However, our results concerning the positive impact of wild boar disturbance on the vegetation cannot be generalized. Elsewhere, the lack of hunting activity could also be a problem for these habitats.

AB  - Most tundra carbon flux modeling relies on leaf area index (LAI), generally estimated from measurements of canopy greenness using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), to estimate the direction and magnitude of fluxes. However, due to the relative sparseness and low stature of tundra canopies, such models do not explicitly consider the influence of variation in tundra canopy structure on carbon flux estimates. Structure from motion (SFM), a photogrammetric method for deriving three-dimensional (3D) structure from digital imagery, is a non-destructive method for estimating both fine-scale canopy structure and LAI. To understand how variation in 3D canopy structure affects ecosystem carbon fluxes in Arctic tundra, we adapted an existing NDVI-based tundra carbon flux model to include variation in SFM-derived canopy structure and its interaction with incoming sunlight to cast shadows on canopies. Our study system consisted of replicate plots of dry heath tundra that had been subjected to three herbivore exclosure treatments (an exclosure-free control [CT], large mammals exclosure), and a large and small mammal exclosure [ExLS]), providing the range of 3D canopy structures employed in our study. We found that foliage within the more structurally complex surface of CT canopies received significantly less light over the course of the day than canopies within both exclosure treatments. This was especially during morning and evening hours, and was reflected in modeled rates of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary productivity (GPP). We found that in the ExLS treatment, SFM-derived estimates of GPP were significantly lower and NEE significantly higher than those based on LAI alone. Our results demonstrate that the structure of even simple tundra vegetation canopies can have significant impacts on tundra carbon fluxes and thus need to be accounted for.

AB  - Grazing, a defining use of rangelands, can have immediate and legacy impacts in ecosystems with short evolutionary histories of grazing and where climatic conditions are marginal and variable. In arid rangelands of the Colorado Plateau, domesticated ungulates were introduced in the 1800s at high densities and grazing has been maintained in the region at variable stocking rates for approximately the past 150 yr. Historic grazing practices, combined with a marginal climate, may have caused an irreversible shift in the vegetation community leading to limited recovery with cessation of grazing. Using three exclosures ranging from 12 to 50 yr of age, we evaluated vegetation composition, diversity, and cover inside the exclosures and compared them with directly adjacent, actively grazed areas outside of the exclosures in the fall and spring of 2018 and 2019. We then asked 1) How do exclosures and their adjacent unexclosed sites differ in vegetation diversity, composition, and cover? and 2) Are there significant differences in cover of key forage species in exclosed versus unexclosed areas? Overall, there were significant differences in vegetation communities inside and outside of exclosures in both seasons. Composition, alpha, and beta diversity differed between grazed and exclosed sites, with higher alpha and beta diversity in the 50-yr exclosure in the fall. Composition was significantly different between exclosures and unexclosed sites at all sites and in all seasons. Cover of several important forage grasses (Achnatherum hymenoides, Hilaria jamesii, Elymus elymoides) was higher in exclosed areas, while cover of Scleropogon brevifolius and Bouteloua gracilis was higher in unexclosed areas. Taken together, these results indicate limited recovery of vegetation in the absence of grazing, with exclosures exhibiting higher plant diversity, as well as cover of some desirable forage species, suggesting this area has not undergone irreversible state change but recovery may require > 50 yr of grazing cessation.

AB  - When exotic species are introduced to new environments, they often have a competitive advantage over native species. In northern Australia, pigs, cattle, and water buffalo have established widespread, feral populations. As ungulates have high water requirements, they typically congregate near waterpoints. We used a fencing experiment to test whether native macropods preferentially visited savanna waterholes where large ungulates were excluded. We also investigated whether water scarcity affected the visitation behaviour and temporal activity patterns of herbivores at waterholes and whether increasing prey aggregation at waterholes increased dingo presence. We found that macropods did not use fenced waterholes preferentially over unfenced ones. Cattle presence at waterholes increased as water became scarce, while macropod and pig presence peaked in the middle of the dry season. Macropod activity declined rapidly at the end of the dry season when cattle activity was greatest, suggesting that macropods may avoid waterholes in areas utilised by cattle when competition for resources is high. Macropods and all ungulates visited waterholes more during a drought year compared to an average rainfall year. Despite increasing prey activity, dingo presence at waterholes did not increase when water became scarce. However, dingo presence increased significantly on moonless nights. Our results suggest that competition between macropods and ungulates may intensify during periods of water scarcity. Climate change and pastoral intensification are likely to increase competition for resources between ungulates and macropods in Australian savannas, potentially threatening macropod populations across the landscape in the future. Significance statement In northern Australia, feral populations of pigs, cattle, and water buffalo compete with native wildlife for access to water sources. As interspecific competition favours species with a size advantage, we tested whether kangaroos and wallabies (macropods) preferentially use waterholes where large ungulates (cattle and buffalo) were excluded. We found that macropods avoided waterholes when cattle presence was high but did not preferentially use waterholes where livestock were excluded. When water scarcity peaked during a drought, macropods and all three feral ungulate species visited waterholes more. However, increased prey presence at waterholes during the drought did not correspond with increased predator (dingo) presence. Our study advances the understanding of behavioural interactions between invasive and native species at important shared resources, and how this may affect wildlife conservation in an increasingly unpredictable environment.

AB  - Grazing and browsing by large ungulates can have a strong effect on habitat composition and structure. Associated effects can be reduction in the abundance of palatable tree species and alter understory properties, thereby affecting habitat complexity. Changes in habitat structure and complexity can in turn affect arthropod predation pressure, as arthropod predators are strongly influenced by habitat characteristics. This may be increasingly important in production forests, as such systems are often more vulnerable to disturbances such as pest insects. However, studies exploring this indirect link between ungulates and predation rate are sparse. We explore this link through the comparison of fenced plots excluding ungulates (for four years) with associated control plots replicated in 16 forest stands covering a large geographical area. We measured vegetation characteristics to assess the effect of exclusion on habitat structure. We used plasticine models to compare predation rates in fenced and control plots on pine trees. In addition, we sampled herbivorous insects to explore the potential relationship between predation and herbivore abundance. We could only demonstrate a weak effect of browser exclusion on habitat structure, suggesting that the time of exclusion was too short to cause a vegetation response. In terms of arthropod predation, we found that predation was positively affected by understory cover, but not related to herbivore abundance. Understory properties such as species composition and biomass has been demonstrated to be affected by ungulates in other studies. Therefore, we propose that ungulate browsing -despite weak effects of browsing exclusion in our study -can affect arthropod predation via changes in the understory, which could potentially affect pest populations. Our study is one of the first attempts to connect effects of mammalian browsing to changes in predation rates on herbivorous insects.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Throughout the southeastern U.S., white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter deer) are the dominant herbivores and have the potential to impact vegetation communities through selective browse pressure. Previous studies regarding deer herbivory impacts focused on northeastern and midwestern U.S. forests. Additionally, most studies have observed herbivory effects over short timescales (i.e., <10 years). Therefore, we sought to determine deer herbivory effects on vegetation structure and composition among three different ecoregions in Mississippi at 0, 5, and similar to 20 years after exclusion. In 2000, 3 pairs of experimental units were identified in each of the Upper Coastal Plain, Lower Coastal Plain, and Mississippi Alluvial Valley ecoregions. An exclosure treatment was randomly assigned within each pair (averaging 2.7 ha) with the other experimental unit a control. From May-June, vegetation structure and composition were measured among 10 systematic sampling points per plot during 2000, 2005, and 2021. While no treatment effects on vegetation composition and structure were observed, among-year differences suggested a shift in overstory canopy conditions between 2005 and 2021 towards greater basal area and canopy coverage resulting in a decrease in forbs, legumes, shade intolerant species, and high year-round deer-preferred forage species. Deer herbivory effects could have been obscured by overstory conditions, low deer densities, and similar baseline conditions reflecting past herbivory effects. Regional differences in forest structure and composition and exclosure breaches may also be responsible for the lack of treatment effects. Future studies should consider utilizing disturbance to offset prior herbivory impacts and to standardize overstory conditions.

AB  - Here, we aimed to define ecological indicators of environmental change for monitoring the effect of a reintroduced species, the Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica), over the vegetation of a natural protected area with contrasting habitats. This species was reintroduced 30 years ago in the Sierra de Guadarrama National Park, Spain, and its population has since grown exponentially, reaching high densities in some areas. We tested the suitability of two complementary indicators: browsing damage on woody species and the percentage of moss cover loss on rocky outcrops. For this purpose, we used a mathematical approach to zone the natural protected area according to the historical presence of the species and established five different Iberian ibex pressure classes (Classes I-V). Our results showed a direct link between Iberian ibex pressure and vegetation status. Model predictions suggested 10% moss loss in the areas with low pressure (Class I) but 64% loss in the areas with high pressure (Class III), mostly due to ungulate trampling on rocks. Similarly, browsing damage increased with increasing pressure classes for different woody species. Low palatable plant species such as Pinus spp. showed little change in browsing damage for increasing ungulate pressure whereas more palatable plants (e.g., Erica arborea) showed significantly greater browsing damage variation across pressure classes (i.e., high sensitive to herbivory pressure). Both, moss cover on rocks and widely distributed palatable woody plants proved useful ecological indicators for monitoring ungulate populations in mountainous areas with a diverse array of habitats (e.g., rocky vs. woody). This methodology may help select the most suitable indicators for each type of ecosystem or dominant habitat in ungulate-dominated ecosystems.

AB  - Forest management can enhance the ecosystem services forests provide, but it can also alter the capacity of forests to provide those services in the future. Ecosystem-based management has been widely implemented to mitigate the deterioration of forest ecosystems by reducing dissimilarities between managed and natural forests. Ecosystem-based management objectives generally aim to maintain community composition, stand structure, ecosystem functions and services. Heavy browsing pressure by ungulates at densities unrepresentative of past abundance could interfere with these objectives by chronically and selectively browsing tree regeneration following logging.Using a browsing exclusion experiment, we investigated how the effects of different moose browsing pressures on tree regeneration could interfere with ecosystem management objectives in boreal forests of Quebec, Canada. Management objectives in this region include, among others, reaching targeted coniferous trees densities for commercial harvest, favouring the conservation of birches (Betula spp.) to maintain soil quality and conserving fruit-bearing trees due to their ecological significance for biodiversity. We used path analyses to differentiate direct and indirect effects of moose on seedling density and mixed models to investigate how browsing affected sapling recruitment and whether resulting densities are compatible with ecosystem management objectives.By directly reducing the overall sapling density, moose browsing indirectly increased seedlings densities of all deciduous species. This indirect effect increased with browsing pressure and favoured raspberry cover, which was positively or negatively linked to seedling density, depending on tree species. Moderate and heavier browsing pressures reduced coniferous sapling density below the ecosystem management target. Moose suppressed birch saplings so that the minimal target of 50 birches ha-1 was not met under heavier browsing pressure. Sapling density of fruit-bearing trees was low under all browsing pressures when compared to exclosures. Policy implications Heavy moose browsing is preventing the achievement of ecosystem management objectives in our study area.Positive indirect effects on seedling densities suggest that reducing moose density could allow released seedlings to replenish the sapling layer, but we discuss why this would not guarantee reaching ecosystem management objectives. To help forest managers evaluate and respond to challenges posed by high ungulate densities, we suggest incorporating browsing inventories in national forest surveys to monitor this chronic disturbance and modulate decisions for forest ecosystem management.

AB  - Understanding the influence of non-native herbivores on ecosystems by means of dietary foraging and seed dispersal is important for understanding how non-native species can alter an invaded landscape, yet requires multiple methodologies. In south-eastern Australia, introduced sambar deer (Rusa unicolor) are rapidly expanding in range and placing native ecosystems at risk through browsing and as vectors for seed dispersal. We simultaneously investigated sambar deer dietary composition and seed dispersal using DNA sequencing and germination trials, from faecal pellets collected in alpine and wet forest ecosystems. This allowed us to contrast the dietary impacts of introduced sambar deer in different environments, and to explore the potential for habitat-specific variation in diet. DNA sequencing of the trnL, ITS2 and rbcL gene regions revealed a diverse plant species dietary composition comprising 1003 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Sambar deer exhibited intermediate feeder behaviours dominated by forbs in alpine and shrubs in wet forest ecosystems. A large proportion of plant OTUs were considered likely to be native, however, the proportion of exotic species in the diet in both ecosystems was greater than would be expected based on the proportion of exotic species in each of the two landscapes. Seed germination trials indicated that sambar deer can disperse a substantial number of native and exotic species in both alpine and wet forest ecosystems. In alpine ecosystems, an individual sambar deer was estimated to disperse on average 816 (+/- 193) seeds per day during the study period, of which 652 (+/- 176) were exotic. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that native plant species comprise the majority of sambar deer diets in Australian ecosystems and that the introduced species is dispersing both native and exotic plant species via endozoochory. However, exotic species seedling germination numbers were significantly higher in alpine ecosystems, and given the large daily movements of sambar deer, represents a significant vector for the spread of exotic plant species. Management of native plant species and vegetation communities of conservation significance, or at risk to sambar deer browsing is of high priority, through either the removal of sambar deer or implementation of exclusion-based methods.

AB  - Large herbivores are considered a natural and important determinant for high biodiversity in woodland habitats and have been increasingly reintroduced to nature areas across Europe with the aim of re-establishing natural processes to promote and protect biodiversity. One of the herbivore species playing an increasing role in ecological restoration initiatives is the European bison - the largest extant terrestrial mammal in Europe. However, despite numerous reintroductions of bison for biodiversity purposes, the empirical evidence for their impact is highly limited. Using permanent plots, we investigated the impact of European bison on ground vegetation in forest habitats over a period of eight years. The bison increased the species richness of vascular plants, though mainly to the benefit of graminoids. The effect varied, however, among forest types, with the strongest effect in oak forests with dense and abundant ground vegetation while beech forests characterized by full canopy cover were unaffected. Bison also benefitted bryophytes, which increased in abundance, indicating a generally altered competitive environment with reduced dominance. These results thus provide some of the first empirical evidence, indicating that European bison can promote plant species diversity in forest habitats, by removal of plant biomass, zoochorous seed dispersal, and creation of microhabitat. We thus suggest that introduction of European bison to mixed light woodlands can be a good strategy, benefitting both biodiversity and the conservation of the threatened herbivore species itself.

AB  - The introduction of mammalian herbivores negatively affects insular vegetation, especially plant species with narrow distributions that are vulnerable to herbivory or that evolved in the absence of native mammal herbivores. Eradication programs have been performed on many islands worldwide, though assessment of the responses of vegetation is crucial to guarantee the success of these programs. In this study, we aimed to evaluate vegetation recovery after a reduction in the feral goat population on Es Vedr`a, an islet in the Balearic Islands (Western Mediterranean Basin). We monitored nine permanent plots in three different habitats (rocky areas, grasslands, shrublands) to evaluate the variation in plant coverage, functional traits and diversity indexes over time. We obtained data for each plot by annual field sampling in mid-May of 2016-2019. We observed a significant recovery of the predominant species in each plant community and an increase in many functional traits. We found significant variation in taxonomic diversity in rocky areas and grasslands, but not in shrublands, and functional diversity only varied in rocky areas. Therefore, plant diversity benefited from the reduction in the goat population and functional redundancy increased in rocky areas, improving the capacity to respond against disturbances. However, the reduction in the goat population was not sufficient to preserve plant communities and negative effects reappeared in 2019, coinciding with the increase in the goat population. Therefore, absolute eradication of introduced herbivores represents a unique, efficient strategy to guarantee the ecological restoration of affected habitats in microinsular ecosystems.

AB  - Earth's tropical savannas typically support high biomass of diverse grazing herbivores that depend on a highly fluctuating resource: high-quality forage. An annual wet-dry cycle, fire and herbivory combine to influence forage quality and availability throughout the year. In the savannas of northern Australia, a depauperate suite of large native (marsupial) herbivores (wallaroos [Osphranter spp.] and the agile wallaby [Notamacropus agilis]) compete for resources with non-native large herbivores introduced in the late nineteenth century, particularly bovines (feral and managed cattle [Bos spp.] and feral water buffalo [Bubalus bubalis]) that now dominate the landscape. Anecdotal reports of recent population declines of large macropods and negative impacts of bovines highlight the need to better understand the complex relationship between forage, fire and abundance of native and introduced large herbivores. The pyric herbivory conceptual model, which posits complex feedbacks between fire and herbivory and was developed outside Australia, predicts that native and introduced large herbivores will both respond positively to post-fire forage production in Australian savannas where they co-occur. We used grazing exclosures, forage biomass and nutrient analyses and motion-sensor camera-trapping to evaluate the overall robustness of the pyric herbivory model in the Australian context, specifically whether forage quantity and quality are impacted by herbivory, season and fire activity, and which forage attributes most influence large grazing herbivore abundance. Forage quantity, as measured by live, dead and total herbaceous biomass and proportion of biomass alive, was higher inside herbivore exclosures, even at relatively low densities of herbivores. Forage quality, as measured by fibre content, was not affected by herbivory, however, crude protein content of live herbaceous biomass was greater outside herbivore exclosures. Recent fire was an important predictor of all measures of forage quantity and quality. Recent fire occurrence decreased overall quantity (biomass) but increased quality (decreased fibre content and increased crude protein content); late dry season fires resulted in forage with the highest crude protein content. The predictions of the pyric herbivory conceptual model are consistent with observations of the feeding behaviour of introduced bovines and some large macropods in northern Australian savannas, lending support to the global generality of pyric herbivory in fire-prone grassy biomes.

AB  - Large introduced mammalian herbivores, either as livestock or feral populations, can have important effects on vegetation and animals. Introduced herbivores can be of high conservation concern if they impact threatened native species in protected areas. We evaluated temporal and spatial trends in the relative abundance of introduced water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) and their potential to induce competition-related ecological and demographic effects on native rusa deer (Rusa timorensis) in Komodo National Park and the Wae Wuul Nature Reserve-two protected areas in Eastern Indonesia. To monitor ungulate population abundances and population growth rates of water buffalo and rusa deer, we counted their dung (a validated abundance index in these two species) along 350 permanently marked transects at 11 sites over five islands annually between 2003 and 2018. Water buffalo dung abundance varied with the site, year and their interaction. Water buffalo dung was most abundant within the Wae Wuul Nature Reserve, and their dung abundance varied considerably among sites in Komodo National Park. Water buffalo site-specific dung abundances fluctuated independently over time. In areas of high water buffalo dung densities, rusa deer altered resource use and had lower population densities than sites without water buffalo. Rusa deer dung-based population growth rates were negatively influenced by density-dependent regulation and only weakly by water buffalo dung density. Currently, managers do not control water buffalo in either protected area. Nevertheless, the benefits of control could reduce water buffalo effects on vegetation composition, watercourse integrity, or the potential to transmit disease into native ungulates.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted involving deer exclosures and planting of Quercus acutissima, a deciduous oak, to reveal forest recovery patterns and factors following clear-cutting at overcrowded conifer plantation sites. Sites were selected in a warm temperate region in western Japan, which is dominated by deciduous broad-leaved secondary forests and extensive conifer plantations. Thirteen years after clear-cutting in the study area, naturally regenerated stands were established with exclosures. The exclosures housed vegetation dominated by pioneer trees, such as Mallotus japonicus or Zanthoxylum ailanthoides. In contrast, naturally regenerated stands without exclosures had limited pioneer trees present. Vegetation dominated by pioneer shrubs (e.g. Aralia elata) was established in these stands. Reduced canopy height and total basal area were observed for vegetation outside the exclosures. In stands where Q. acutissima was planted immediately after clear-cutting, the vegetation that is dominated by this species in the canopy layer was established in both stands with and without exclosure. Most of tree species that emerged after clear-cutting across all stands were of the frugivore seed dispersal type. However, results from this study suggest that these frugivore seed dispersal type trees are more vulnerable to deer browsing than trees from the Fagaceae family. Natural forest recovery following plantation clear-cutting could be inhibited due to deer herbivory at relatively low deer density if a major source of tree regeneration in clear-cut plantations is non-Fagaceae trees.

AB  - Overbrowsing by ungulates has degraded understory vegetation in worldwide forests. Understory degradation causes soil erosion and environmental degradation, causing mature tree decline. Although ungulate exclosure fences are installed to protect vegetation, their effectiveness in preventing tree decline associated with soil degradation remains unclear. We aimed to fill this gap on slopes of Mt. Shiraga, Japan, where sika deer have overbrowsed for >20 years. Tree-ring records in 1960-2022 for eight beeches per each of inside and outside fences were analyzed to compare stem basal area increment (BAI, cm(-2) yr(-1)) and trend change timings for BAI (i.e., break-point). Soil properties, exposed root height (ERH) as cumulative soil erosion index, and intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) as water limitation proxy were also compared. Compared with areas inside fences, areas outside fences had no understory vegetation, higher ERH, and higher soil hardness and moisture. BAI outside fences turned their growth trend from positive to negative since 2004, but not inside fences. Break-point of BAI outside fences matched the understory degradation period in the field. The long-term BAI trend (i.e., regression slope of BAI) after the break-point was negatively related to ERH but not to soil properties (e.g., soil hardness and moisture). Furthermore, BAI outside fences was negatively related to iWUE after the break-point, whereas BAI inside fences was not. These results indicate that the maintenance of understory by fencing prevents overbrowsing-associated mature tree decline through mitigating root exposure and related water limitation, despite the potential of water competition with understory.

AB  - Trophic rewilding that reintroduces large animals into landscapes to re-establish food web interactions and restore biodiverse ecosystems has gained widespread attention. Despite this attention, few empirical studies have assessed the effectiveness of trophic rewilding for promoting biodiversity and its wider ecological benefits. Here we tested if trophic rewilding that introduced functional analogues for extinct large herbivores into former farmland of lowland England delivered additional benefits to biodiversity and ecosystems functioning. We predicted that these benefits would exceed those achieved through passive rewilding, that is, unassisted habitat succession after the cessation of agricultural activity. Using a 9-year exclosure experiment, we found trophic rewilding reduced woody plant diversity and total carbon storage by 73% and 23%, respectively, compared to passive rewilding plots that excluded mammalian herbivores. However, trophic rewilding likely increased plant diversity and carbon storage compared to if land was left under continued agricultural production, e.g. artificial pastures associated with intensive livestock production. The vegetation changes accompanying trophic rewilding were further linked to a greater diversity and biomass of ground-dwelling arthropods by 21% and 167%, respectively, relative to passive rewilding, partly by creating more structurally complex vegetation. Given the trade-offs in biodiversity and ecosystem functions between trophic and passive rewilding, our study highlights that trophic rewilding will need to be applied alongside other interventions to tackle biodiversity loss while combatting climate change. Ultimately, the utility of trophic rewilding as a restoration tool will depend on the conservation outcomes valued by society.

AB  - Surveillance of endoparasites at the host community level is rarely reported for ungulates. Yet, changes in the composition and abundance of species in ungulate assemblages, coupled with environmental and climate change, bring into focus the need for baseline data on endoparasite occurrence in host species at the community level. We investigated the prevalence and intensity of eggs of endoparasites in feces of a dynamic boreal ungulate community in Yukon, Canada, that included reintroduced bison (Bison bison), as well as introduced elk (Cervus canadensis), naturally colonizing mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and resident populations of caribou (Rangifer tarandus), moose (Alces americanus), and thinhorn sheep (Ovis dalli). We also examined the change in endoparasite prevalence and intensity in bison fecal samples collected eight years apart. The prevalence of eggs detected in feces differed across species for most endoparasite groups. We also provide new records of several endoparasites in novel hosts or new geographic records. We detected a substantially greater prevalence and intensity of trichostrongyle-type eggs in bison feces between samples collected eight years apart. Our data emphasize the need for targeted pathogen surveillance programs to monitor the movement of various ungulate and associated endoparasites. This is particularly pertinent since our data potentially supports evidence for the continued northward expansion and host switching of protostrongylid species, which may have health implications for animals at a new interface.

AB  - Natural disturbances can maintain forest diversity by creating a heterogeneous resource landscape, which can contribute to coexistence of early-and late-successional species. However, almost all forested ecosystems are also subject to multiple anthropogenic stressors, which could inhibit plant diversity and forest recovery after natural disturbances. Here, we present the first large-scale replicated field experiment testing the interactions among two natural and two anthropogenic disturbances in a mature secondary temperate forest. Specifically, we test the extent to which: 1. a natural windthrow (tornado), 2. deer browsing, 3. salvage logging, a common forestry practice to generate revenue after natural disturbances, and 4. mechanical removal of the understory, drive subsequent plant community assembly, diversity, and abundance. Our results have two clear messages. First, the combined disturbances, especially salvage logging, increased plant species richness and abundance; we found 65 more species in 0.1 ha of the disturbed areas versus the same area of reference forest. Second, we found that it was critical to analyze plant growth forms separately; each major plant growth form responded to the distur-bances differently. Surprisingly, salvage logging, browsing, and vegetation removal had negligible effects on the diversity and abundance of tree seedlings or saplings. In contrast, salvaging increased herb richness by 30% (six extra species per 36 m2 plot), and shrubs were twice as abundant in salvaged versus unsalvaged plots. The combined disturbances created unique plant communities in comparison to adjacent undisturbed reference sites, but plant growth forms differed in which combination of disturbances shifted community composition the most. We did not find that non-native invasive species substantially increased in abundance in response to the dis-turbances, nor were invasive species unique to the salvaged areas. Together, our results demonstrate that a patchwork of combined natural and anthropogenic disturbances can promote plant diversity in a human-modified temperate forest. In particular, the combination of a natural wind disturbance and salvage logging benefited native herbaceous species, the plant group that represents the vast majority of vascular plant species (similar to 80%) in temperate forests across the world.

AB  - Livestock grazing is one of the most common management practices for grasslands and can greatly affect their biodiversity. However, arthropod diversity response patterns to grazing regimes are difficult to predict. We conducted a short-term grazing exclusion experiment in traditionally managed alkali grasslands in Hungary to investigate differences between grazed and ungrazed vegetation for different arthropod groups. The experiment was laid out in a full factorial design, with twelve 50 x 100 m short-term grazing exclosures in vegetation types with high (alkali wet meadow) and low productivity (alkali steppe). We sampled ground beetles and spiders with pitfall traps and true hoppers by sweep netting. We used vegetation type (wet meadow vs dry steppe), man-agement (grazed vs ungrazed) and their interaction as fixed effects in mixed models. We found higher species richness and activity density of spiders and ground beetles in the more productive wet meadow vegetation, where the community structure of each arthropod group also shifted toward hygrophilous species. Significant interactions between vegetation type and management indicated a dependence of management effects on vegetation types: arthropod community structure shifted towards hygrophilous species in ungrazed meadows, but not in ungrazed steppe sites. True hopper abundance was higher in grazed meadow sites, but lower in grazed steppe sites, compared to ungrazed sites. True hopper community structure shifted toward generalist herbivores in ungrazed sites, regardless of vegetation type. We concluded that vegetation types determine arthropod communities and modulate the effects of grazing on arthropods. Our results suggest that moderate disturbance from low-intensity grazing has a positive or neutral effect in wetter, more productive vegetation, but a negative or neutral effect in drier, less productive vegetation, depending on the arthropod group. Herbivorous insects that dwell on plants are particularly affected by management because they are more susceptible to direct impacts, such as unintentional predation by grazing cattle, and because of asymmetrical competition between mammalian and insect herbivores.

AB  - Understanding the influence of post-disturbance forest management on tree regeneration is critical for assessing ecosystem recovery and guiding future responses. In particular, the influx of elevated coarse woody material (CWM) following wind disturbance, if left in situ, may impede herbivore access, thereby protecting saplings from browsing damage through a natural 'exclosure effect'.In 2013, a tornado in northcentral Maine, United States and subsequent salvage logging operations created three clear 'treatments' for evaluation of the exclosure effect: blowdown, blowdown plus salvage logging and an undamaged control. Nine years post-tornado, we inventoried tree regeneration within these treatments to evaluate differences in sapling abundance, species composition, size structure and browsing intensity. We also inventoried CWM, including the height above forest floor.Results revealed significant differences in sapling composition and browsing intensity among treatments. The salvage treatment had the highest proportion of browsed saplings (56 +/- 28%; mean +/- standard error), followed by the control (9 +/- 10%) and blowdown (5 +/- 8%). Blowdown had by far the greatest mean (50 +/- 9 cm) and average maximum (169 +/- 43 cm) heights for CWM. Binomial generalized linear models revealed that browsing probability was a function of mean CWM height and an interaction between sapling density and proportion of sapling hardwoods. Thus, browsing damage was less likely in plots with greater CWM heights and more likely in plots with greater sapling density and more hardwood saplings.Synthesis and applications. This study furthers our understanding of ecosystem recovery following blowdown and salvage logging. Results suggest that salvage logging created important differences in coarse woody material (CWM) abundance and height distribution, when compared to un-salvaged areas, and that these differences in turn altered sapling size structure and browsing intensity. These findings highlight the potential long-term effects of successive disturbances, as the differences evident in these early stages may persist for decades or longer. Importantly, we provide evidence of the exclosure effect, suggesting that CWM retained in the un-salvaged area protected saplings from moose browsing. Thus, in post-disturbance areas where browsing threatens regeneration, we recommend that managers consider retaining CWM to serve as a natural exclosure.

AB  - Aim Functional traits mediate the interactions of species among themselves and with their environment, providing a link between diversity and ecosystem function. Crucially, the loss of biodiversity can jeopardize the functionality of ecosystems. Much focus is on predicting the impacts of current and future species loss; however, modern ecosystems have undergone biodiversity decline throughout the Late Quaternary, starting with the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions. Thus, the fossil record offers the opportunity to investigate the long-term legacy of biodiversity erosion and how this is affecting modern ecosystems in a cumulative manner. We aimed to investigate changes in functional diversity and redundancy of a local mammal community at Hall's Cave, a site with a continuous record from 21,000 years ago to the present. Additionally, we included several common introduced species in the modern community to test whether they restore some lost ecological function. Location Central Texas. Time period Late Pleistocene to Present. Major taxa studied Mammals. Methods We used eight functional traits (mass, diet, arboreality, cursoriality, soil disturbance, group size, activity period and migration habit), which, collectively, describe the ecological role of a species and its influence on ecosystem processes, to construct a multidimensional functional space. The functional richness, range and distribution of the Hall's Cave community and the degree of functional redundancy were characterized statistically over time. Results We found that declines in functional diversity were greater than expected given the decrease in species richness, implying that lost taxa contributed higher than average distinct ecological function. Functional distances between the remaining species increased through time, leading to reduced functional redundancy in younger communities. However, recently introduced taxa increased functional diversity to levels similar to those in the Holocene and partly restored the functional space occupied by Late Pleistocene fauna. Main conclusions Our local-scale analysis demonstrates how prolonged biodiversity erosion not only leads to functionally depauperate communities, but, crucially, lowers ecological resilience to future disturbance.

AB  - Most alpine ecosystems are subject to non-native species invasion as climate warms and human disturbance increases. Therefore, it is important to identify the main barriers and facilitators of alpine plant invasions. While there is much research in continental alpine areas, there is limited research in maritime environments, which have distinctive biological, edaphic and geomorphologic features due to the scarcity of snow in winter. Here, we examine the contribution of anthropogenic and biotic factors on non-native plant invasions in the alpine areas of lutruwita (Tasmania), Australia. Specifically, we test whether disturbances associated with roads and livestock grazing facilitate non-native plant invasion and if biotic resistance from native plants and wild grazing animals inhibits such invasion. We used floristic data from: a statewide database; data from long-term grazing exclosures, and data from paired quadrats on roadsides and natural vegetation. Our results showed that non-native plants were associated with roadside disturbance and livestock grazing, with the latter having a legacy effect of 50 years. The persistent effect of stock grazing was evident in the exclusion experiment monitored over 30 years, where non-native plants occurred sporadically in time and space. In contrast, we found that the presence of wild grazing mammals, complete vegetation cover and high native richness, restricted non-native plants, emphasizing the importance of biotic resistance in controlling non-native plant invasions. These results indicate that livestock removal and road closure could be effective in reversing non-native plant invasion in this and other areas with wild vertebrate herbivores and high plant cover.

AB  - Swahili coastal forests, spanning the Kenyan and Tanzanian coastlines and the Zanzibar Archipelago, are integral to the biodiverse Eastern Arc and Coastal Forest region. These forest ecosystems face considerable anthropogenic threats. This study contributes to the available knowledge on the floral composition and plant community assemblages of Mnemba Island, a small sandy cay in the Zanzibar Archipelago, which helps to establish baseline data for conservation purposes. Two main coastal forest plant communities were identified: (1) the Casuarina cunninghamiana-Suriana maritima open to closed sandy dry coastal forest, and (2) the Eugenia capensis-Mimusops obtusifolia coastal forest. A total of 91 different plant species belonging to 54 plant families were identified for the island. Community 2, an indigenous forest, supports diverse bird breeding colonies and is a crucial habitat for the threatened Aders' duiker. Understory development is limited due to the historical Suni antelope overpopulation. Environmental factors like salt spray, allelochemicals, herbivore browsing, and climate fluctuations influence the vegetation abundance and composition. The study underscores differences in species diversity and composition between the planted Casuarina community and the natural atoll vegetation. The natural vegetation shows affinities with the Zanzibar-Inhambane edaphic coral-rag scrub forest and the transitional rainforest. Several species characteristic of Indian Ocean atolls were identified, providing insights into invasion ecology and conservation strategies. The study contributes conceptually to our understanding of vegetation dynamics in island ecosystems by highlighting the interplay between plant communities, environmental processes, and human activities. The fragile yet resilient nature of Mnemba's unique ecosystem is emphasised, offering insights for conservation management, long-term monitoring, and adaptive approaches tailored to island environments.

AB  - Agents of global change commonly have a higher impact on island ecosystem dynamics. In the Mediterranean region, those dynamics have historically been influenced by anthropogenic impacts, for example, the introduction of invasive species and overharvesting of resources. Here, we analysed the spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation in sa Dragonera island, which experienced a large environmental change ca. 4000 years ago by the arrival of humans. Anthropogenic impacts, such as herbivory by goats and over-logging, ended in the 1970s, while in 2011 the site became the largest Mediterranean island where rats were eradicated. Invasive rats and goats played the ecological role of two endemic species, the cave goat and the giant dormouse, which inhabited the island for more than 5 million years and were rapidly extinct by humans. We used Landsat imagery to explore NDVI as a proxy of vegetation productivity over the years 1984-2021, orthophotos to assess changes in land and vegetation covers and historical plant inventories to study the dynamics in plant diversity. Results showed that those indicators steadily increased both in spring and in summer, while the noise around the trends was partially explained by climate variability. The regime shifts in the temporal dynamics of vegetation productivity suggested a transient from a perturbed to a non-perturbed stable state. Trends in successional dynamics, spatial self-organization and plant diversity also showed the same type of transient dynamics. Historical perturbations related to harvesting (mainly the synergies between goat browsing, burning and forest over-logging) were more important than rat eradication or the influence of climate to explain the vegetation dynamics. Our study shows the transient nature of this small island ecosystem after 4000 years of perturbations and its current path towards vegetation dynamics more controlled by ecological interactions lacking large herbivores and omnivores, drought dynamics and the carrying capacity of the island.

AB  - Fire and herbivory interact to alter ecosystems and carbon cycling. In savannas, herbivores can reduce fire activity by removing grass biomass, but the size of these effects and what regulates them remain uncertain. To examine grazing effects on fuels and fire regimes across African savannas, we combined data from herbivore exclosure experiments with remotely sensed data on fire activity and herbivore density. We show that, broadly across African savannas, grazing herbivores substantially reduce both herbaceous biomass and fire activity. The size of these effects was strongly associated with grazing herbivore densities, and surprisingly, was mostly consistent across different environments. A one-zebra increase in herbivore biomass density (similar to 100 kg/km(2) of metabolic biomass) resulted in a similar to 53 kg/ha reduction in standing herbaceous biomass and a similar to 0.43 percentage point reduction in burned area. Our results indicate that fire models can be improved by incorporating grazing effects on grass biomass.

AB  - Livestock browsing and trampling can deplete plant regeneration and thus drive natural ecosystems towards degradation. This phenomenon may be particularly true in tropical dry forests, which support extensive livestock herds feeding on native vegetation, but has rarely been experimentally addressed. Here we examine how browsing and trampling by exotic goats impacts seed bank and seedling survivorship of woody plant species in a Caatinga dry forest by performing a 4-year exclosure experiment. Soil seed bank and transplanted seedlings from four woody plants species were monitored through a year across 14 and 10 paired plots (free goat-access vs exclosure plots), respectively. Regardless of treatment, the soil seed bank was low in density 14 seeds/m(2) ( +/- 13, standard deviation) and taxonomically impoverished (24 species). Small to intermediate-sized seeds from dry fruits (75%) and abiotically dispersed species (65%) prevailed. The most common attractive structure was an elaiosome (33%), but pulp (14%) and aril (9.5%) were also recorded. 60% of the species presented some type of dormancy and 32% presented a pleurogram. 57% of the seeds were classified as forming a transient seed bank, while seasonally transient seeds accounted for 43% of the total seed bank. Seed bank attributes were not affected by goats, including proportion of viable seeds (25.85 & PLUSMN; 41.3 in exclosure plots vs 31.45 & PLUSMN; 42.49 in free-access plots) and diversity. However, seedling survival one year after transplantation was higher for the plant species in the exclosure plots (68.4%) as compared to the free-access plots (39%). Although there were no significant differences in seed bank, our results suggest that free-ranging goats in densities typical of the Caatinga region can impose elevated seedling mortality to the dominant woody dry forest species even considering a short period of time.

AB  - Most landscapes today have lost much of their historical biodiversity, particularly the largest animals (mega- fauna). Yet, in some regions declining human pressure and stronger conservation policies allow megafauna to return, and rewilding efforts sometimes seek to amplify these trends through reintroductions. Megafauna, however, return to landscapes still inhabited and used by people, making it crucial to understand how they adapt to such shared landscapes. Here, we studied the space use of a uniquely diverse megafauna community, including recently reintroduced European bison, in a rewilding area in the Romanian Carpathians. We conducted extensive sign surveys (2688 km) to monitor eight large mammals in 2022 and 2023. We then applied Bayesian occupancy models to understand the space use of our target species. Our results show that landscape composition is important for allowing a diverse megafauna community to share space with people. Many species (e.g., red deer, roe deer, grey wolf, brown bear) used different forms of refuge habitat (i.e., topographically complex areas, dense forest) to avoid people. Only one species, the European bison, appeared to be negatively affected by direct human pressure (i.e., active logging). Conversely, land-use legacies such as forest gaps and abandoned pastures were selected by most species (i.e., European bison, red deer, roe deer, wild boar, brown bear). Our study shows that diverse megafauna, including the largest species, can share space with people in mosaic landscapes. These landscapes, especially if human pressure is declining, offer major opportunities to protect megafauna and restore their ecological roles, in Europe and elsewhere.

AB  - There is growing interest in adapting forest management to increase diversity, in both composition and structure, to restore old-growth characteristics and to build resiliency against anthropogenic disturbances. In order to determine appropriate interventions, managers need to evaluate the quality of natural areas but efficient and effective measurements are elusive. Using a suite of herbaceous species and measuring their responses to experimental treatments, we aim to assess (1) the sensitivity of different metrics and (2) the current and likely future effects of gap-generating disturbances and abundant deer on the understory of a northern hardwood forest in Wisconsin, USA. More specifically, we investigated plant cover, density, height, aggregate height and the proportion of individuals producing flowers/fruits under unmanipulated canopies v. three gap sizes, with and without downed woody material (DWM) additions, and inside v. outside of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus vir-ginianus) exclusion fences, approximately seven years after treatment. The effects were taxon-specific with Anemone quinquefolia, Arisaema triphyllum, Laportea canadensis and Trillium grandiflorum being most responsive to canopy structure, Impatiens spp. and T. grandiflorum to deer pressure, and A. triphyllum, Impatiens spp., L. canadensis and Sanguinaria canadensis to canopy structure in combination with DWM. Cover was least responsive to treatments, density and proportion of sexually reproducing individuals sometimes differed, but height was overall the best metric. Mean height and maximum height showed similar results so we suggest that managers focus on measuring maximum height to limit sampling time. We also draw attention to the importance of retaining and/or creating DWM which has long been recognized as an important structural feature promoting diversity in natural forests. In the present study, DWM additions appeared to play a role in mitigating micro-climates and/or deer pressure for multiple herbaceous species.

AB  - Ecosystem restoration is a critical component of land management, countering the loss of native biodiversity. Restoration efforts are enhanced by reintroducing naturally occurring ecosystem processes, including disturbances that may impact species characteristics such as niche position or niche size. In grasslands, grazing and fire affect plant diversity and habitat complexity, which potentially influence insect dietary behaviors and thus their contributions to functions like seed and arthropod predation. Using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes, we characterized variation in the dietary niche of six ground beetle species (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in response to grazing by reintroduced bison and prescribed fire disturbances in twenty tallgrass prairies. Management disturbances did not affect activity density for most beetle species and mean trophic position was mostly unaffected. However, five of six species exhibited increased trophic niche area and breadth with disturbances, indicating a switch to a more generalist diet that incorporated a wider range of food items.The combination of bison and fire impacts may increase vegetation patchiness and heterogeneity, driving these diet changes. Morphological traits and microhabitat preferences might mediate response to disturbances and the resulting heterogeneity. Combining prescribed fire and grazing, which increases plant diversity and vegetation structural diversity, may help beetle communities establish over time and support the ecological functions to which these insects contribute.

AB  - In Argentina, the expansion of soybean production has forced the relocation of cattle to marginal sites for agriculture, such as the wetlands of the Parana River floodplain, constituting a threat to the vegetation of these ecosystems. In this context, the aims of this study were (1) to assess the effect of different resting/grazing periods on the composition, richness, diversity and dominance of functional groups of wetlands vegetation assemblages and (2) to analyze the influence of cattle exclusion on these parameters. For these purposes, three wetlands subjected to rotational grazing management included in different paddocks with different resting and grazing periods were selected. Exclosures were established in upland and lowland zones. Samples of vegetation cover were collected in these zones with quadrats of 4m(2). Our results demonstrated that vegetation parameters did not differ as grazing and resting time period differed. Both the wetland with short resting/long grazing period as well as the wetland with long resting/short grazing period had lower diversity and richness in comparison with the wetland without cattle grazing. Grazing exclusion favoured the survival of species in upland zones, increasing total richness and diversity and the development of unpalatable non-forage and shrub/subshrub species. Exclosures would be beneficial to the ecological condition of the vegetation of the wetlands, allowing grazing-sensitive species to recover from grazing and trampling.

AB  - Savannas are characterized by the co-occurrence of two different plant life forms: grasses and trees. Herbivory plays a major role in the balance between grasses and trees in savanna ecosystems. The present study aimed to investigate the impact and interactions between long-term (i.e. 20 years) herbivory and/or its exclusion and plant life form on the soil biochemistry of a protected semi-arid savanna ecosystem in the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. To study the effects of herbivory on soil properties, herbivore exclosures (fully fenced areas, partially fenced areas, and an unfenced area) were used in conjunction with plant life form (trees and grasses) were considered. Interaction effects of herbivory and plant life form on soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total nitrogen (TN), total carbon (TC), available phosphorus (available P), exchangeable cations (K+, Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+) cation exchange capacity (CEC), organic matter (OM) and total microbial activity were determined on savanna soils in the Nkuhlu exclosures, KNP. Exclosures where herbivores were present had significantly higher soil pH, The presence of herbivores caused an increase in soil pH, EC, exchangeable Na, CEC, and OM. The influence of the tree canopy was significantly more pronounced in elevating total C and N, exchangeable K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+, CEC and OM than observed in the open grassland zones across all exclosures. The two-way interaction between herbivory and plant life form resulted in significant decreases in TN, TC, exchangeable K, Na and Mg in open grassland areas outside of herbivore exclosures where large animals had direct access, as compared to areas within the exclosures which was protected from animal entry herbivory. This data can be used by national parks as an indicator to increase their knowledge of environmental issues relating to maintaining and preserving landscape features of savannas.

AB  - The reintroduction of wildlife can have significant ecological impacts by altering the flow of energy in food webs. Recently, plains bison were reintroduced to part of Banff National Park after a 150-year absence. The large herbivore's reintroduction was expected to have far-reaching effects on the ecosystem due to its significant energy requirements and interactions with habitat and other sympatric species. This study explores the impacts of bison reintroduction on the movement and resource use of another large-bodied grazer, the Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep. Between 2018 and 2021, we collected data from GPS collars fit on 39 bighorn sheep and 11 bison. We analyzed home range patterns, resource selection, and interactions to investigate the potential for interspecific competition, facilitation, and resource complementarity. At the population level, bison and bighorn sheep exhibited low levels of spatial overlap and there was strong evidence of resource separation in all seasons. Interactions between species did not appear to affect sheep movement rates; however, we did see differences in forage selection patterns for sheep with overlapping home ranges with bison. Collectively, results did not support the potential for competition or facilitation between bison and bighorn sheep and instead provided the strongest evidence of complementarity.
   Reintroducing North America's largest land mammal can have significant ecological impacts, particularly on the species they interact with. Using GPS data, we analyzed space and resource use of a recently reintroduced herd of plains bison to Banff National Park, to investigate potential interactions with another co-occurring grazing ungulate, the Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep. Comparing the potential for interspecific mechanisms, our study provides further evidence, that where suitable habitat exists, co-existence between lost species assemblages may be achieved meeting social and ecological goals.image

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) impact the ecological integrity of eastern deciduous forests by modifying plant community composition and structure. Previous studies have shown that overabundant deer can negatively impact the recruitment and persistence of both woody and herbaceous plants. However, the strength and nature of these interactions can depend on habitat context. Forest edges provide favorable habitat for deer along with many introduced plant species, and have the potential to modify the nature of deer impacts. Here, we explore whether forest edges shape the impacts of deer on plant communities within the forest landscape. Specifically, we excluded deer, or, alternatively, allowed deer access, in plots along the edge and within the interior of two northern hardwood forests. Background deer abundance in these forests was approximately 6-12 individuals per km(2). After eight years of exclusion, we surveyed plant communities within plots to assess the impacts of deer on plant community composition across the forested landscape. We found that the impacts of deer were robust across habitat context within the forest, with relatively weak impacts on cover and richness of both native and introduced species. Edge habitat, on the other hand, had strong impacts on cover of both native and introduced species, as well as woody and herbaceous species, but the magnitude of these impacts was variable across the two forest sites. This work suggests that deer can have modest impacts when at relatively low densities, and that these effects can be consistent across forest habitat types, while forest fragmentation and subsequent generation of edge habitat can be an important driver of composition in the forest understory.

AB  - Seed predation may reduce the quantity and diversity of seeds and limit seedling recruitment. However, the extent to which seed predation may depend on the species and vegetational microhabitat has been less studied. We studied seed predation of woody species in the Mediterranean-type ecosystem of central Chile. We explored if interspecific differences in the magnitude of seed predation depends on the seed mass, evaluated the role vertebrate herbivores in seed predation, and examined if seed predation depends on the vegetation patch type. We conducted a seed removal experiment with eight woody species in three vegetation patch types (forest, shrub, and open) and replicated in two localities. We established exclosures for birds and mammals (wire cages covering 1 m2) and evaluated seed removal during 18 days within and outside of them. We also evaluated the soil seed availability by collecting soil samples inside and outside these exclosures after 2 years of exclusion in the same vegetation patches, adding other three localities. Exclosures significantly reduced the number of seeds removed in all species and patch types of both localities (overall 24.02% of removal in non-exclusion areas vs. 1.77% in exclosures). The magnitude of seed predation was negatively related to the seed mass of species. Exclosures significantly increased the number and species richness of seeds in the soil of forest and shrub patches of four localities. The results suggest that seed predation is mainly produced by vertebrates, affects several woody species from central Chile, and is more common in forest and shrub patches.

AB  - Emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis), non-native shrubs, and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have been independently shown to affect woody seedling communities. Our objective was to determine the relative importance as well as additive and interactive-effects of these stressors in the context of two environ-mental factors, canopy tree competition and site wetness. We sampled 24 sites, representing three natural non -congruent gradients in ash mortality, deer browse, and introduced shrub invasion. We explored the responses of seedling species abundance, diversity and richness to an array of deer herbivory, ash mortality, and introduced shrubs and varying levels of canopy tree competition, site wetness. The effects of each stressor on the differences in the relative abundance of seedling species was also evaluated. Our results indicate a persistent negative effect of non-native shrubs in drier forest plots on native seedling abundance, richness, and diversity. In wetter forests, non-native shrubs had no effect on native seedling richness or abundance and were positively related to diversity. Deer browse had a negative effect on seedling diversity in wetter forests and no effect in drier forests. Canopy tree competition had a positive effect on seedling diversity in drier forest plots, but negatively affected diversity in wetter forest plots. Ordination analysis revealed that site wetness, non-native shrubs and the total basal area of trees in the stand had the largest impacts on the species composition of seedlings found at each site. Our results suggest that site wetness and chronic stressors like deer and introduced shrubs are interacting to shift seedling communities towards fewer native species as well as to reduce seedling species richness and diversity.

AB  - Increases in the number of wild herbivores resulted in understory degradation because of their overgrazing in forest ecosystems. Deer overgrazing has occurred soil erosion in Japanese beech forests where dwarf bamboo used to be densely covered. Soil erosion can result in a decrease in soil carbon and nutrient contents, causing the soil microbial respiration in such forest ecosystems to be degraded. The objective of this study was to clarify the effects of soil erosion, which sporadically occurs within the forests, on soil properties and microbial activity. Soil erosion indices, such as the maximum height of exposed roots from the soil surface (MAXH), tree and soil properties, microbial basal and substrate-induced respiration, were measured under the canopy of 16 beech trees in each of three deciduous broadleaved forests on southern Kyushu Island, Japan. Soil properties such as the humus mass and the organic matter contents of soil and humus decreased with MAXH. Basal and substrate-induced respiration decreased with increases in MAXH. Soil properties associated with organic matter increased with basal and substrate-induced respiration. These results suggest that soil surface layers that were rich in organic matter ran off because of soil erosion, resulting in the degradation of soil microbial activity. This study suggests that increases in wild herbivore populations degrade soil ecosystem functioning owing to the soil erosion induced by understory disappearance.

AB  - The exclusion of herbivores in forest areas is a strategy used to reduce the impact of selective browsing and increase the regeneration of desired plant species. On Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada), selective browsing by white-tailed deer prevents the regeneration of balsam fir - white birch forests leading to their conversion into white spruce forests. Large deer exclosures were established for ca 10-12 years in clear-cuts with patches of residual forest from 2001 to 2006 to assist in the natural regeneration of fir stands and to provide shelter and food resources for deer. Our objective was to assess how deer use exclosures after the removal of fences according to their spatial configuration and habitat composition. We randomly distributed automatic cameras for periods of 14 days during summer in six exclosures ranging from 3.1 to 11.2 km(2) (n = 25 cameras per exclosure) from which deer were reduced for 10-12 years. We compared candidate occupancy models that included spatial configuration and food resource variables while simultaneously controlling for variables affecting detection probability. We obtained weak evidence that deer habitat use increased by 19% when forage resources, represented by the cover of Cornus canadensis, increased from 0 to 100%. None of the other variables (distance between the border of exclosures and cameras and distance between forest patches and cameras) was retained, suggesting that the use of regenerating forests by deer in summer after a period of exclusion is related to forage availability and therefore, any forest management that improves food production during summer should help maintain or increase habitat use by deer.

AB  - Question Plant-plant facilitation is a critical ecological mechanism in arid environments, influencing biodiversity and ecosystem resilience globally. Shrubs often serve as nurse species, enhancing tree regeneration and sheltering plant communities, particularly in overgrazed or degraded habitats. In this study, we examine the role of shrubs as nurse species in the Socotra Archipelago (Yemen), a biodiversity hotspot in which several endemic tree species, including the iconic frankincense (Boswellia spp.), myrrh (Commiphora spp.), and Socotran dragon's blood (Dracaena cinnabari) trees, are threatened. This is largely due to a lack of natural regeneration caused by the combined effects of overgrazing by goats, sheep, and climatic events such as extreme droughts and cyclones. To aid conservation of threatened trees in arid regions, nature-based solutions are urgently needed to help tree regeneration. Effective nurse plants have this potential, particularly in arid environments. We therefore examined the role of thorny, poisonous, and/or unpalatable shrubs as nurse plants in sheltering threatened plant communities, with a focus on woody species in an arid insular context. Study Area The Socotra Archipelago (Yemen) situated in the western Indian Ocean, east of the Horn of Africa. It is a biodiversity sanctuary and a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site. Methods Vegetation surveys were conducted in 144 paired plots under six common shrub species and adjacent open areas. Community data, environmental variables, and functional traits were analysed using RLQ and fourth-corner analyses, while Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) evaluated the effects of environmental variables and nurse species on key functional traits based on Community Weighted Means (CWMs). Facilitation effects were quantified using the Relative Interaction Index (RII). Results Our analysis revealed significant variations in species composition and functional traits between under-canopy and open-area plots. Certain shrubs, such as Cebatha balfourii, facilitated significantly higher species richness under its canopy compared to open areas. Elevation and grazing pressure influenced these interactions, with notable effects on functional traits like the occurrence of legumes and tree growth forms. Buxus hildebrandtii was less effective in supporting species richness, while C. balfourii, Lycium sokotranum, and two Cissus species exhibited significant positive facilitation. The LMMs confirmed the importance of environmental variables and nurse shrub characteristics in shaping plant community dynamics. Conclusions The results highlight differences in the facilitative potential of the studied species, with some showing a stronger ability to act as nurse shelters through microhabitat amelioration and protection from herbivory. The presence of tree species under shrubs is confirmed, and the role of these nurse species in supporting diverse plant communities provides critical insights for conservation strategies, supporting biodiversity resilience and sustainable management in degraded landscapes like Socotra Island and other arid environments. Future efforts should focus on leveraging nurse shrubs to mitigate environmental pressures and enhance ecological restoration, in particular to help conserve range-restricted and threatened plant species.

AB  - Across boreal forests, trees are the main living biomass carbon (C) stock, but the understory vegetation can contribute significantly to the C cycling and net forest carbon dioxide (CO2) balance. The patchy understory vegetation, which consists of sunlit (i.e. lichen-like) and shaded habitats (i.e. dwarf shrub-like), is often altered by ungulate grazers. Grazers may influence understory CO2 exchange and, consequently, the forest CO2 balance. Grazing affects differently the biomass of slow-growing lichens compared to the faster-growing mosses and dwarf shrubs, and therefore the effects of grazing on CO2 exchange in the patchy understory vegetation may vary temporally. We studied how excluding grazing for short and long periods affects the CO2 exchange and vegetation biomass in the understory of an oligotrophic Scots pine forest. We measured growing season (2019, 2020) CO2 exchange across sunlit and shaded habitats inside fences that had excluded large grazers for 0-1 and 25-26 years and in the adjacent grazed area. In addition, we measured the height of understory vegetation. We found that short-term grazer exclusion increased ecosystem CO2 source fluxes only in the shaded habitats. However, long-term exclusion of grazing decreased CO2 net release regardless of the habitat type. Furthermore, grazer exclusion increased moss depth immediately, which coincided with an abrupt intensification of CO2 net release. Considering the impacts of grazing over both short- and long-term periods may help to forecast C fluxes more accurately, which may be relevant for informed climate solutions regionally and even on a larger scale.

AB  - Introduced ungulates have a profound impact on Hawaiian ecosystems yet are also considered a valuable resource for recreational and subsistence hunting. These conflicting values have led to challenging issues for resource managers. Distribution assessments allow resource managers to simultaneously prioritize areas for targeted removal for conservation benefit while also maintaining or even promoting hunting opportunities in other areas. This study identified distribution trends for three introduced ungulate species, wild pigs ( Sus scrofa), black-tailed deer ( Odocoileus hemionus columbianus), and feral goats ( Capra hircus) on the island of Kaua'i in the Hawaiian Islands. Using species distribution modeling techniques, we aimed to identify patterns in ungulate distributions across ecosystems and time, and potential species interactions. Data were collected using motion activated cameras deployed across the entire island of Kaua'i from July 2020 to July 2021. Wild pigs were the most frequently detected species, observed at 53 out of 59 locations, followed by black-tailed deer at 30 locations, and feral goats at 9 locations. Distribution models indicate some degree of competition between deer and pigs and show considerable overlap between black-tailed deer distribution and much of the last remaining critical habitat for threatened and endangered native species. Our results suggest that pigs prefer mid-elevation areas with moderate rainfall while goats preferred arid areas regardless of slope and elevation. Differences in the distribution and abundance of these species highlight the divergent impacts invasive ungulates have on native ecosystems throughout the Hawaiian Islands and may help identify high priority areas for their management.

AB  - Ecosystem engineers that modify the soil and ground-layer properties exert a strong influence on vegetation communities in ecosystems worldwide. Understanding the interactions between animal engineers and vegetation is challenging when in the presence of large herbivores, as many vegetation communities are simultaneously affected by both engineering and herbivory. The superb lyrebird Menura novaehollandiae, an ecosystem engineer in wet forests of south-eastern Australia, extensively modifies litter and soil on the forest floor. The aim of this study was to disentangle the impacts of engineering by lyrebirds and herbivory by large mammals on the composition and structure of ground-layer vegetation. We carried out a 2-year, manipulative exclusion experiment in the Central Highlands of Victoria, Australia. We compared three treatments: fenced plots with simulated lyrebird foraging; fenced plots excluding herbivores and lyrebirds; and open controls. This design allowed assessment of the relative impacts of engineering and herbivory on germination rates, seedling density, vegetation cover and structure, and community composition. Engineering by lyrebirds enhanced the germination of seeds in the litter layer. After 2 years, more than double the number of germinants were present in "engineered" than "non-engineered" plots. Engineering did not affect the density of seedlings, but herbivory had strong detrimental effects. Herbivory also reduced the floristic richness and structural complexity (<0.5 m) of forest vegetation, including the cover of herbs. Neither process altered the floristic composition of the vegetation within the 2-year study period. Ecosystem engineering by lyrebirds and herbivory by large mammals both influence the structure of forest-floor vegetation. The twofold increase in seeds stimulated to germinate by engineering may contribute to the evolutionary adaptation of plants by allowing greater phenotypic expression and selection than would otherwise occur. Over long timescales, engineering and herbivory likely combine to maintain a more-open forest floor conducive to ongoing ecosystem engineering by lyrebirds.

AB  - Experimental studies across biomes demonstrate that herbivores can have significant effects on ecosystem functioning. Herbivore effects, however, can be highly variable with studies demonstrating positive, neutral or negative relationships between herbivore presence and different components of ecosystems. Mixed effects are especially likely in the soil, where herbivore effects are largely indirect mediated through effects on plants. We conducted a long-term experiment to disentangle the effects of non-native moose in boreal forests on plant communities, nutrient cycling, soil composition and soil organism communities. To explore the effect of moose on soils, we conduct separate analyses on the soil organic and mineral horizons. Our data come from 11 paired exclosure-control plots in eastern and central Newfoundland, Canada that provide insight into 22-25 years of moose herbivory. We fit piecewise structural equations models (SEM) to data for the organic and mineral soil horizons to test different pathways linking moose to above-ground and below-ground functioning. The SEMs revealed that moose exclusion had direct positive impacts on adult tree count and an indirect negative impact on shrub percent cover mediated by adult tree count. We detected no significant impact of moose on soil microbial C:N ratio or net nitrogen mineralization in the organic or mineral soil horizon. Soil temperature and moisture, however, was more than twice as variable in the presence (i.e. control) than absence (i.e. exclosure) of moose. Overall, we observed clear impacts of moose on above-ground forest components with limited indirect effects below-ground. Even after 22-25 years of exclusion, we did not find any evidence of moose impacts on soil microbial C:N ratio and net nitrogen mineralization. Our long-term study and mechanistic path analysis demonstrates that soils can be resilient to ungulate herbivore effects despite evidence of strong effects above-ground. Long-term studies and analyses such as this one are relatively rare yet critical for reconciling some of the context-dependency observed across studies of ungulates effects on ecosystem functions. Such studies may be particularly valuable in ecosystems with short growing seasons such as the boreal forest.1.2.3.4.5.

AB  - While the direct effects of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on vegetation have been intensively studied, less is known about the indirect and interactive effects of herbivory on lower trophic levels, such as soil microbes and their processing of carbon pools. We explored how carbon dynamics shift with release from over-browsing by white-tailed deer in two mature stands of oak and hemlock trees. We measured soil carbon pools (for example, soil organic matter, carbon stocks, litter biomass, and litter stabilization) and fluxes (for example, soil respiration, methane uptake, microbial substrate use, and litter decomposition) using a spatially balanced survey design inside and outside two 24-year-old deer exclosures, one in each forest stand. Soil carbon pools were higher inside the exclosures than in deer-browsed plots in both forest stands, but the effect of deer herbivory on fine-scale spatial patterning of soil carbon pools and mean carbon fluxes varied by forest type. Release from deer herbivory in the oak stand increased the patchiness of soil pools and led to higher litter decomposition, soil respiration, and methane uptake rates. Release from deer herbivory in the hemlock stand did not affect the spatial structure of soil pools, had little effect on methane uptake, and had negative effects on litter decomposition and soil respiration. These differences may be due in part to the interactive effects of two herbivores, deer and the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), that appear to be limiting regeneration and promoting the proliferation of monodominant hay-scented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula) in the hemlock-dominated stand. Our work suggests that future efforts consider multiple zoogeochemical stressors simultaneously, in addition to variation in environmental templates, to explain uncertainties in carbon pools and fluxes in temperate forested ecosystems.

AB  - Grazing from megaherbivores such as bison (Bison bison) and periodic fire are 2 important disturbance regimes in grassland ecosystems. In restored tallgrass prairies where these processes were previously removed, prescribed fire application and bison reintroduction are tools used by managers to recreate habitat heterogeneity formed by these disturbances. Tallgrass prairie bird communities may be indirectly affected by these disturbances, as bison and prescribed fire alter the structure of critical breeding habitat for grassland birds. The objectives of this research were to determine the effects of bison and prescribed fire on grassland breeding birds in 2 tallgrass prairie preserves in the Midwest region of the United States. We surveyed bird communities, vegetation structure, and bison activity at an Illinois preserve (n = 20 sites) and an Indiana preserve (n = 27 sites) in 2020 and 2021 and compiled a history of restoration activities (e.g., prescribed fire, planting year) at these sites. Grazing and fire disturbances affected grassland bird diversity and abundances, whereas we found little to no evidence that restoration planting age and spatiotemporal factors affected grassland bird populations. Disturbance effects often corresponded to species-specific responses to changes in vegetation structure. Grassland-obligate bird diversity was lower in recently burned and ungrazed management units, in comparison to unburned-ungrazed and unburned-grazed sites. Henslow's sparrow (Centronyx henslowii), a species known to be sensitive to recent prescribed fire, exhibited increased abundance with time since fire, an increase that was further amplified with bison presence. These results highlight the importance of applying varying levels of grazing and fire disturbance to provide variable vegetation structure to accommodate the habitat preferences of a diversity of grassland bird species. Moreover, our results indicate that bison may play a role in mediating the differing effects of variable prescribed fire frequencies on grassland bird species of concern.

AB  - Large herbivores (>= 45 kg) fulfill key ecological functions. Since the Late Pleistocene megafauna diversity and abundances have declined sharply, with profound consequences for ecosystems. On this background the concept of trophic rewilding has emerged and is increasingly applied to restore natural disturbance regimes and trophic interactions, ultimately aiming to recreate self-sustaining, dynamic and diverse ecosystems. Effects of such efforts (e.g., more heterogeneous habitats) are evident, but herbivore space use, and the resulting distribution of effects on vegetation remain poorly understood. Here, we examine habitat selection of semi-feral water buffalos (Bubalus bubalis), horses (Equus ferus) and cattle (Bos taurus) in a Danish rewilding area. We modelled space use with remote sensed covariates, reflecting resources (vegetation greenness, distance to water) and infrastructure (distances to fences, paths, shelter). Seasonal differences and former land use were tested separately. We found large-herbivore space use to shift seasonally, reflecting food and water availability, and to be influenced by infrastructure and former land use. Horses reacted less to vegetation greenness and water than the two bovids. Cattle selected for green vegetation in summer, while buffalos showed the strongest association with water bodies. Overall, the three semi-feral herbivore species diverged in their habitat use both spatially and seasonally. This can be expected to translate to variable and complementary ecological impacts such as grazing, physical disturbances and habitat engineering. Such variable space use likely increases habitat heterogeneity and species richness. We therefore suggest that a diverse large-herbivore guild is key, both to understanding megafauna ecology and for successful rewilding efforts.

AB  - Large herbivores often co-occur and share plant resources with herbivorous insects in grassland ecosystems; yet, how they interact with each other remains poorly understood. We conducted a series of field experiments to investigate whether and how large domestic herbivores (sheep; Ovis aries) may affect the abundance of a common herbivorous insect (aphid; Hyalopterus pruni) in a temperate grassland of northeast China. Our exclosure experiment showed that 3 years (2010-2012) of sheep grazing had led to 86% higher aphid abundance compared with ungrazed sites. Mechanistically, this facilitative effect was driven by grazing altering the plant community, rather than by changes in food availability and predator abundance for aphids. Sheep significantly altered plant community by reducing the abundance of unpalatable forbs for the aphids. Our small-scale forb removal experiment revealed an "associational plant defense" by forbs which protect the grass Phragmites australis from being attacked by the aphids. However, selective grazing on forbs by sheep indirectly disrupted such associational plant defense, making P. australis more susceptible to aphids, consequentially increasing the density of aphids. These findings provide a novel mechanistic explanation for the effects of large herbivores on herbivorous insects by linking selective grazing to plant community composition and the responses of insect populations in grassland ecosystems.

AB  - Grazing herbivores may affect soil microbial communities indirectly by impacting soil structure and vegetation com-position. In high arctic environments, this impact is poorly elucidated, while having potentially wide-reaching effects on the ecosystem.This study examines how a key arctic herbivore, the muskox Ovibos moschatus, affects the soil microbial community in a high arctic fen. Environmental DNA was extracted from soil samples taken from grazed control plots and from muskox exclosures established 5 years prior. We sequenced amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene to provide insight into the microbial communities. We found that in the grazed control plots, microbial communities exhibited high evenness and displayed highly similar overall diversity. In plots where muskoxen had been excluded, microbial diversity was significantly reduced, and had more uneven intra-sample populations and overall lower ecological richness and even-ness. We observed that the composition of microbial communities in grazed soils were significantly affected by the pres-ence of muskoxen, as seen by elevated relative abundances of Bacteroides and Firmicutes, two major phyla found in muskox faeces. Furthermore, an increase in relative abundance of bacteria involved in degradation of recalcitrant carbo-hydrates and cycling of nitrogen was observed in grazed soil. Ungrazed soils displayed increased abundances of bacteria potentially involved in anaerobic oxidation of methane, whereas some methanogens were more abundant in grazed soils. This corroborates a previous finding that methane emissions are higher in arctic fens under muskox grazing. Our results show that the presence of large herbivores stimulates soil microbial diversity and has a homogenizing influence on the inter-species dynamics in soil microbial communities. The findings of this study, thus, improve our understanding of the effect of herbivore grazing on arctic ecosystems and the derived methane cycling.

AB  - Ungulate herbivory might induce different effects on the diversity and growth of trees and shrubs. The density, distribution, and the species of ungulates as well as plant communities' composition and other factors determine whether ungulate herbivory promotes or limits plants' diversity and growth. The impacts of ungulates on woody plants are commonly surveyed with exclosure-control approaches. In practice, such surveys frequently only cover short periods of time, addressing immediate management needs. Long-term surveys, documenting lasting effects of ungulate herbivory, are highly needed, but still rare. However, the general transferability of outcomes of long-term surveys might be limited due to different disturbing factors. This study addresses two basic aspects of long-term monitoring in mountainous forests, based on a unique 30-year data set: (1) Possible long-term effects of herbivores on forest vegetation (e.g., species/structural diversity of woody plants) and (2) potential differences between short-term and long-term surveys in terms of height growth patterns. In our study, diversity of woody plant species showed great variability with no significant impact of ungulate herbivory. The presence of ungulates had a significantly negative effect on the vertical structural diversity and growth of trees. Due to the slower growth on control plots, it took trees longer to reach a 160 cm height-threshold with their terminal shoots than on exclosure plots. Our long-term control-exclosure data set indicated that long-term survey data indeed might differ from growth patterns represented by short-term surveys. This can be induced by several factors, like site-specific growth patterns of trees, occurrences of natural abiotic disturbances that influence the functional life of exclosures, and others.

AB  - Plants are particularly vulnerable to physical disturbance in low productivity areas, due to the high energetic cost of replacing lost tissue. In the eastern United States, serpentine savannahs are fragmented ecosystems with high concentrations of rare endemic plant species, low concentrations of soil nutrients, and severe deer overpopulation. This study assessed the recovery of flowering plants in a serpentine savannah when deer were excluded. Plant count, flower count, vegetative area, and plant height of 10 serpentine plant species were compared inside and outside of deer exclusion structures throughout an entire growing season. Throughout the growing season and across the plant community, deer exclusion consistently increased values for all plant response traits measured. Species that responded most strongly to deer exclusion included Arabis lyrata (Brassicaceae, the wide ranging lyre-leaf rockcress) and the serpentine near-endemic Symphyotrichum depauperatum (a serpentine aster known only in the eastern US). The slender knotweed, Polygonum tenue performed worse in excluded areas, which may indicate exclusion by more competitive species, or, alternatively, local scarcity. Overall, species richness did not increase in excluded plots, which may indicate that years of deer overbrowsing have depleted the local seed banks. While longer term studies might reveal different results, this study showed significant differences in vegetation response traits between excluded and unexcluded areas in just one year. We recommend that further restoration efforts should include reintroductions of locally extirpated species, in combination with deer exclusion to allow rare serpentine plant communities and their seedbanks to recover from intense overbrowsing pressure.

AB  - Trees and shrubs in suburban forests can be subject to chronic herbivory from abundant white-tailed deer, influencing survival, growth, secondary metabolites, and ecological success in the community. We investigated how deer affect the size, cover, and metabolomes of four species in the understory of a suburban forest in central New Jersey, USA: the woody shrubs Euonymus alatus and Lindera benzoin, the tree Nyssa sylvatica, and the semi-woody shrub Rosa multiflora. For each species, we compared plants in 38 16 m(2) plots with or without deer exclosure, measuring proportion cover and mean height after 6.5 years of fencing. We scored each species in all plots for deer browsing over 8 years and assessed selection by deer among the species. We did untargeted metabolomics by sampling leaves from three plants of each species in an equal number of fenced and unfenced plots, conducting chloroform-methanol extractions followed by LC-MS/MS, and conducting statistical analysis on MetaboAnalyst. The proportion of a species browsed ranged from 0.24 to 0.35. Nyssa sylvatica appeared most selected by and susceptible to deer; in unfenced plots, both its cover and mean height were significantly lower. Only cover or height was lower for E. alatus and L. benzoin in unfenced plots, while R. multiflora height was greater. The metabolomic analysis identified 2333 metabolites, which clustered by species but not fencing treatment. However, targeted analysis of the top metabolites grouped by fencing for all samples and for each species alone and was especially clear in N. sylvatica, which also grouped by fencing using all metabolites. The most significant metabolites that were upregulated in fenced plants include some involved in defense-related metabolic pathways, e.g., monoterpenoid biosynthesis. In overbrowsed suburban forests, variation of deer impact on species' ecological success, potentially mediated by metabolome-wide chemical responses to deer, may contribute to changes in community structure.

AB  - The introduction of exotic herbivores to islands is one of the most harmful challenges to the conservation of insular biodiversity, causing the extinction or geographical reduction of many plant species worldwide and motivating conservation actions from environmental managers. Here, we evaluated the recovery of plant communities, specifically the endangered Medicago citrina, on a small islet close to Ibiza (Western Mediterranean Basin) after the complete eradication of introduced rabbits (fully eradicated in 2016). To evaluate the variation of plant richness and coverage, five permanent plots were installed in 2015 to record over five years. Additionally, an exhaustive census geolocating all M. citrina individuals was carried out in 2019. Total vegetation cover, plant richness and Shannon's diversity index significantly increased throughout the study period. We counted 2,322 M. citrina individuals over 15 cm tall and a large number of seedlings. Therefore, this population not only successfully recovered, but also established the largest population in the entire geographic distribution of this species. The demographic structure is dominated by young individuals and a few large individuals, and the distribution across the island is heterogeneous since the largest spots of individuals were located in ravines where air currents probably provided seeds from plants located in inaccessible cliffs. However, the appearance of the invasive insect Icerya purchasi now threats the population of M. citrina as it feeds on the tissues of adult plants and compromises its development and survival. This study proves the eradication of herbivores is the most efficient way to conserve vulnerable species.

AB  - Most grazing lands in Mediterranean ecosystems that support extensive sheep farming systems are characterized by unfavorable edapho-climatic conditions, especially in semi-arid areas. Often, though, their use is far from sustainable, causing erosion and ecosystem degradation impacts. In this paper, we explore the use, productivity, and flora diversity of typical Mediterranean grazing lands in four farms at the Agra locality in the western part of Lesvos Island, Greece. For a period of two consecutive growing seasons (September to June), we recorded herbage biomass on 16 plots of grazing lands with three measurements per season of land cover and plant productivity (biomass) inside small exclosures (cages) protected from grazing. We recorded the species richness of herbaceous plant communities within and outside the cages at the end of every growing season, the period of maximum growth of herbaceous species. We also chemically analyzed the biomass for crude protein at the end of each season. Results show sizable productivity differences among pasture plots as well as seasons and an overall medium to high degree of productivity and species richness considering the relatively intensive grazing, with little differences over the different cages and the degree of grazing intensity. These results suggest that the "history" of the fields is important, as grazing lands that had been used for arable crops in the past, as well as those leveled and in favorable locations, were the most productive and diverse ones, while shallower soils and inclined grazing lands showed signs of overuse and degradation. Overall, though, these ecosystems showed a high degree of resilience despite their intensive use.

AB  - Understanding the effects of traditional livestock grazing abandonment on the ability of mountain grasslands to sustain multiple ecosystem functions (ecosystem multifunctionality; EMF) is crucial for implementing policies that promote grasslands conservation and the delivery of multiple ecosystem services. In this study, we evaluated the effect of short- and long-term transhumant sheep abandonment on EMF through a grazing exclusion experiment in a grassland of the Cantabrian Mountains range (NW Spain), where transhumant sheep flocks graze in summer. We considered four key ecosystem functions, derived from vegetation and soil functional indicators measured in the field: (A) biodiversity function, evaluated from total plant species evenness, diversity and richness indicators; (B) forage production function, evaluated from cover and richness of perennial and annual herbaceous species indicators; (C) carbon sequestration function, evaluated from woody species cover and soil organic carbon indicators; and (D) soil fertility function, evaluated from NH4(+)-N, NO3(-)-N, P and K content in the soil. The EMF index was calculated by integrating the four standardized ecosystem functions through an averaging approach. Based on linear mixed modeling we found that grazing exclusion induced significant shifts in the considered individual ecosystem functions and also on EMF. Long-term livestock exclusion significantly hindered biodiversity and forage production functions, but enhanced the carbon sequestration function. Conversely, the soil fertility function was negatively affected by both short- and long-term grazing exclusion. Altogether, grazing exclusion significantly decreased overall EMF, especially in long-term livestock exclusion areas, while the decline in EMF in short-term exclusions with respect to grazed areas was marginally significant. The results of this study support the sustainability of traditional transhumance livestock grazing for promoting the conservation of grasslands and their ecosystem function in mountain regions.

AB  - Management of tree cover, either to curb bush encroachment or to mitigate losses of woody cover to over-browsing, is a major concern in savanna ecosystems. Once established, trees are often "trapped" as saplings, since interactions among disturbance, plant competition, and precipitation delay sapling recruitment into adult size classes. Saplings can be directly suppressed by wildlife browsing and competition from adjacent plants, and indirectly facilitated by grazers, such as cattle, which feed on neighboring grasses. Yet few experimental studies have simultaneously quantified the effects of cattle and wildlife on sapling growth, particularly over long time scales. We used a series of replicated 4-ha herbivore-manipulation plots to investigate the net effects of wildlife and moderate cattle grazing on Acacia drepanolobium sapling growth over 10 years that encompassed extended wet and dry periods. We also simulated more intense cattle grazing using grass removal treatments (0.5-m radius around saplings), and we quantified the role of intraspecific tree competition using neighborhood tree surveys (trees within a 3-m radius). Wildlife, which included elephants, had a positive effect on sapling growth. Wildlife also reduced neighbor tree density during the 10-yr study, which likely caused the positive effect of wildlife on saplings. Although moderate cattle grazing did not affect sapling growth, grass removal treatments simulating heavy grazing increased sapling growth. Both grass removal and neighbor tree effects on saplings were strongest during above-average rainfall years following drought. This highlights that livestock-driven reductions in grass cover and catastrophic wildlife damage to trees during droughts present a need, or an opportunity, for targeted management of sapling growth and woody plant cover during ensuing wet periods.

AB  - Questions: What is the role of native and domestic herbivores in native-alien vegetation changes in sub-Antarctic forests? Does herbivory suppression increase native while reducing alien species diversity?Location: Central-eastern Tierra del Fuego Island, Argentina.Methods: In four sites, we set up three different treatments: excluded grazing by livestock (cattle), by livestock and native (guanaco) herbivores, and grazed control plots in Nothofagus antarctica forests. We then monitored the dynamics of understorey native and alien plants (species richness, abundance) of dicots, monocots, and ferns over 6 years. Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used to determine the effects of herbivore exclusion and time on species richness and abundance. In addition, we calculated the abundance rate of change to quantify temporal dynamics.Results: Overall species richness did not change in the exclusion plots, but native and alien abundances were affected by herbivory and time since exclusion. The abundance of native monocots changed after herbivore exclusion, increasing its dominance significantly inside exclusion plots. However, the cessation of herbivory did not reduce alien species in general. Only alien dicots significantly declined in the livestock exclusion treatment. Further, we found that the two dominant alien grass species (Holcus lanatus and Poa pratensis) respond differently to grazing exclusion, and their response was modulated by forest basal area.Conclusions: Our results indicate that cattle and guanaco grazing had variable effects on native and alien plants, and that herbivore exclusion has a substantially positive effect on native grasses. However, the magnitude of temporal changes was more significant for vegetation richness and abundance than the effect of exclusion treatments. Herbivore exclusions can initiate a rapid recovery of compositional attributes of native vegetation in N. antarctica forests grazed by livestock.

AB  - Aims Soil processes in arid ecosystems are strongly controlled by resource scarcity. Grazing intensification can induce changes in ecosystem processes through multiple pathways, adding new constraints to those of local conditions. We focus on grazing-induced changes in litter traits and soil environment that may affect litter decomposition and N dynamics in temperate grass-shrub steppes. Methods We performed three litterbag decomposition experiments to evaluate: i) the effect of litter traits in a common garden (ex situ), ii) the effect of soil environment using a foreign common litter substrate (in situ), and iii) the interactive effects of litter traits and soil environment (grazed vs. exclosure communities, reciprocal transplants in situ). Field experiments were replicated in three blocks with paired plots under a long-term exclosure (> 25 years) and under year-round sheep grazing. Local litter included mixtures of species of grasses and shrubs, separately. Results Grazing exclusion did not alter litter decomposition rates, either through changes in litter traits or in soil environment. Nevertheless, N released during grass litter decomposition was 286% higher in exclosures than in grazing communities. The difference was associated to changes in litter C:N ratio. The effects were maintained when results were integrated to the entire litter community. Conclusion Our study suggests that litter decomposition rates in arid steppes are strongly controlled by local drivers. Ungulate grazing does not have an important influence on litter mass loss, but it can exert a strong control on N flux during decomposition, by changing grass litter traits.

AB  - Selective feeding by overabundant herbivores can considerably alter plant community composition and structure, often benefiting non-native species. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are a dominant herbivore in North America, known for their preference for native plants over unpalatable invasive species. Common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica L.), a widely invasive shrub, is largely avoided by deer, potentially facilitating its competitive advantage against native plants. This study investigates the interactive effects of R. cathartica invasion and deer browsing on native woody plants within a postindustrial urban forest undergoing restoration. Specifically, we employed both a long-term observational tree survey and an experimental shrub study to assess R. cathartica impacts on native trees and shrubs, and to investigate whether R. cathartica presence intensifies deer browsing. For the tree study, we surveyed 10 native tree species planted in areas with varying levels of R. cathartica invasion to assess tree health as a function of R. cathartica and canopy tree cover. For the shrub study, we examined deer and insect herbivory on five deer-resistant native shrubs with and without deer exclusion and R. cathartica removal. We found that increased R. cathartica cover correlated with reduced health in native tree species, a relationship not found between the trees and native canopy tree cover. We also found that all five planted native shrub species experienced considerable browsing, with deer and insect damage intensifying in the presence of R. cathartica. This study highlights the complex interplay between non-native plant invasions and native herbivore activity, demonstrating that R. cathartica indirectly facilitates increased deer herbivory on native species. These findings emphasize the need for integrated forest restoration strategies that address both invasive plant removal and herbivore management to support native species recovery.

AB  - In the degraded and modified environment of the Scottish Highlands, novel ungulate communities have arisen following local extinctions, reintroductions, and the introduction of non-native species. An understanding of the dynamics and interactions within these unique mammal communities is important as many of these mammals represent keystone species with disproportionate impacts on the environment. Using a camera trap survey, we investigated land cover preferences and spatiotemporal interactions within a Scottish ungulate community: the sika deer (Cervus nippon), the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), the red deer (Cervus elaphus), and the wild boar (Sus scrofa). We used generalised linear models to assess land cover preferences and the effect of human disturbance; spatiotemporal interactions were characterised using time interval modelling. We found that sika deer and roe deer preferred coniferous plantations and grasslands, with sika deer additionally preferring woodland. For red deer, we found a slight preference for wetland over woodland; however, the explained variance was low. Finally, wild boar preferred grassland and woodland and avoided coniferous plantations, heathland, and shrubland. Contrary to our expectations, we found no evidence that human disturbance negatively impacted ungulates' distributions, potentially because ungulates temporally avoid humans or because dense vegetation cover mitigates the impacts of humans on their distributions. Furthermore, we detected a spatiotemporal association between sika deer and roe deer. Although the underlying cause of this is unknown, we hypothesise that interactions such as grazing facilitation or an anti-predator response to culling could be driving this pattern. Our work provides a preliminary analysis of the dynamics occurring within a novel ungulate community and also highlights current knowledge gaps in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms dictating the observed spatiotemporal associations.

AB  - There is growing evidence that land-use management practices such as livestock grazing can strongly impact the local diversity, functioning, and stability of grassland communities. However, whether these impacts depend on environmental condition and propagate to larger spatial scales remains unclear. Using an 8-year grassland exclosure experiment conducted at nine sites in the Tibetan Plateau covering a large precipitation gradient, we found that herbivore exclusion increased the temporal stability of alpine grassland biomass production at both the local and larger (site) spatial scales. Higher local community stability was attributed to greater stability of dominant species, whereas higher stability at the larger scale was linked to higher spatial asynchrony of productivity among local communities. Additionally, sites with higher mean annual precipitation had lower dominant species stability and lower grassland stability at both the spatial scales considered. Our study provides novel evidence that livestock grazing can impair grassland stability across spatial scales and climatic gradients.

AB  - QuestionsFree-ranging herbivores are often seen as important endozoochorous dispersal vectors for plant propagules. Dispersal by free-ranging animals, in contrast to domestic animals, and its effects on vegetation have rarely been studied. We ask what are the effects of deposition of dung on open landscape vegetation, how does it influence vegetation development after disturbance by soil removal, and does it change species richness or composition?LocationThe Doupov Mountains, Czech Republic.MethodsWe established a six-year experiment in 2015 to study the effects of dung deposition on vegetation of an open grassland landscape. The experiment comprised 300 plots distributed across five fenced site locations and treatments were implemented in partially crossed design, with soil removed (disturbance) and dung pellets deposited; treatments were applied once to five replicates, from June to October 2015. We recorded plant species cover at the beginning of the vegetation seasons of 2016, 2017 and 2021.ResultsDung deposition increased species richness and Ellenberg Indicator Values for nutrients, and these effects were stronger in disturbed plots; however, these effects diminished with time. There were no effects of dung deposition on species composition. In contrast, disturbance affected species diversity, composition, Ellenberg Indicator Values for nutrients, proportion of dung-dispersed species, but not species richness. Surprisingly, there were no effects of timing of dung deposition.ConclusionsOur results indicate that endozoochorous seed dispersal by red deer impacts vegetation dynamics of this open grassland landscape, but effects are weak and diminish with time. Considering the large seed load in dung, it is possible that endozoochorous seeds from wild herbivores are incorporated into the soil seed bank, where they persist until appropriate ecological conditions for germination arise.
   Does deer poop influence vegetation? The answer seems to be 'it depends'. When deer drop dung into fully grown vegetation, the effect is close to zero. But when deer poop into disturbed vegetation with bare soil, more species appear, even though this effect does not last long.image

AB  - Declines in species diversity have been linked to shifting disturbance regimes and increases in ungulate herbivory. Successful forest regeneration depends on silvicultural methods that can address stand-specific recruitment limitations. This study revisits a long-term experimental gap study in a hemlock-hardwood forest. Our objective was to determine if the treatment effects of deer exclosures and gap size would alter regeneration trajectories. We examined cohort development using permanent plots and gap-wide surveys of likely gap-capture trees. After 18 years, deer herbivory was a strong filter for tree regeneration and appeared to pose an insurmountable bottleneck to the recruitment of some species. Overall, 90% of unprotected stems >0.5 to <= 2 m showed evidence of being browsed by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman). Our results indicate that browse sensitive species were unable to recruit even in resource-rich gap environments. Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L.) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britton) were particularly sensitive to herbivory and absent in heights >1 m outside exclosures. However, inside exclosures in larger gaps, yellow birch saplings often co-dominated the tallest cohorts and eastern hemlock was well established at heights >1 m. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) was the dominant tree species across all treatments and ironwood (Ostrya virginiana Mill.) was frequently among the tallest trees in gaps outside of deer exclosures. Gap size only impacted unprotected seedlings which suggests regeneration is more sensitive to gap size when deer are present. The installation of relatively small (similar to 3.5% of total gap area) deer exclosures, at year two post-harvest, provided opportunities for the recruitment of browse-sensitive species. Collectively, our results highlight the pervasive role of ungulates in structuring forest composition.

AB  - Naturalistic grazing by large herbivores is an increasingly practiced way of managing habitats with conservational value. It has the potential to restore and enhance biodiversity, creating self-sustainable environments vital for organisms requiring regular disturbances to moderate and/or reverse successional changes. European bison, Exmoor pony, and Tauros cattle were introduced in 2015 to a former military training area in Milovice, Czech Republic. The prevailing vegetation type is a forest-steppe savanna with Bromus erectus-dominated xeric grasslands mixed with deciduous shrubs and trees. After the cessation of military use, the area was abandoned which led to successional changes, including the dominance of tall grasses, litter accumulation, and bush encroachment. In 2017-2021, we monitored grassland vegetation in 30 grazed permanent plots (2 x 2 m) and 5 control plots representative of ungrazed, abandoned vegetation adjacent to the grazed areas. Naturalistic grazing increased species richness and the cover of forbs, while the cover of grasses and legumes was minimally affected. Grazing increased functional diversity of plant community, promoted a compositional change to small statured species and an increased incidence of red-list species. Seven years of continuous grazing increased the conservation value of this forest-steppe vegetation, a habitat type rapidly declining in Europe.

AB  - Sapling recruitment in hardwood forests is often suppressed by overstory shade, interspecific competition, and browsing pressure from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman). In some northern hardwood stands, these three interacting factors may cause persistent recruitment failure of the dominant canopy species, sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), into the sapling size class. In this study, we compared initial (two-year) sugar maple and hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana ((Mill.) K. Koch) seedling and sapling recruitment in strip clearcuts to strip selection cuts, with combinations of herbicide and deer exclosures, in a northern hardwood forest with limited sugar maple sapling recruitment. We found that sugar maple sapling recruitment was higher in exclosures, particularly in strip clearcuts. Moreover, mixed models predicted that exclosures in strip clearcuts with herbicide tended to benefit sugar maple sapling recruitment, especially when the pre-treatment density was less than similar to 1500 stems ha(-1). Sapling density of hophornbeam was also promoted in exclosure plots but was negatively affected by herbicide. Graminoid and Rubus spp. cover was also limited by herbicide following harvest, potentially alleviating constraints on future sugar maple sapling recruitment. Our findings indicate that sugar maple sapling recruitment in strip clearcuts is similar to strip selection cuts unless browsing pressure and interspecific competition are also alleviated.

AB  - Clearing of woodlands is used by graziers to promote pasture production, even though understanding of impacts of clearing on native fauna is lacking. We evaluate impacts of clearing on biodiversity by comparing invertebrates associated with ground-layer vegetation of cleared woodlands (grasslands) to that of nearby uncleared woodlands. Two replicates of grasslands consisting of pastures dominated by introduced grasses were compared with two woodlands at each of four locations. The adjacent riparian forest to each grassland and woodland site allowed evaluation of the effect of woodland clearing on the adjacent riparian zone. All habitats were grazed. Invertebrates of ground-layer vegetation were sampled using three suction subsamples of 1m(2 )at each site. Grasslands had significantly lower order richness and abundance of herbivores, pollinators and macroinvertebrates (food for birds) than the woodlands, whereas the riparian forests closely resembled each other in all metrics. Invertebrate assemblages of grasslands also differed significantly from those of the woodlands. BEST analysis showed that groundcover and leaf-litter percentage cover correlated strongest with invertebrate composition. This study has demonstrated that grazing management relying on clearing of fertile grassy woodlands of the rangelands of Central Queensland alters invertebrate diversity and assemblage. Thus, tree clearing not only leads to biodiversity losses in the canopy layer, but also in the ground-layer vegetation.

AB  - Riparian woody plant communities, including shrubs and trees, are essential for maintaining biodiversity, protecting against floods, reducing erosion, and transporting nutrients. However, these habitats are greatly threatened by human activities, particularly agricultural land acquisition, and the introduction of invasive species. This study examined species diversity and interspecific association in riparian woody plant communities along rivers in the Romanian Carpathians. The study focused on communities of Salix purpurea, S. alba, and Hippopha & euml; rhamnoides in mountain regions, with varying sampling efforts at different sites for each species. A total of 174 plant species were found, predominantly herbaceous (77.9%), followed by trees (11.6%) and shrubs (10.5%). While S. alba and S. purpurea communities show high species richness and abundance, S. alba has slightly higher diversity (H ' approximate to 2.23, SD = 0.28) than S. purpurea (H ' approximate to 1.69, SD = 0.42). Contrarily, significant differences exist between H. rhamnoides and S. alba communities in species richness (p = .007) and Shannon diversity (p = .004). PCA analysis elaborated on distinct distribution patterns of plant associations within habitats S. purpurea community, H. rhamnoides community, and S. alba community. Four invasive species (Oenothera biennis L. and Oxalis stricta L. in S. alba communities, Reynoutria sachalinensis Nakai in both S. purpurea and H. rhamnoides communities, and Erigeron canadensis L. in H. rhamnoides communities) were identified, as requiring conservation efforts. Hemicryptophytes dominate species richness, while microphanerophytes and megaphanerophytes significantly contribute to plant abundance. H. rhamnoides formed Hippopha & euml; rhamnoides dunes (2160) Natura 2000 habitat, while S. alba created galleries within the 92A0 Salix alba and Populus alba habitat. In conclusion, the findings from this study highlight the importance of preserving riparian habitats because their value goes beyond local or regional considerations and extends to the global scale due to their unique characteristics.

AB  - Elk Island National Park (EINP) is a fenced park in the Beaver Hills UNESCO Biosphere Reserve of central Alberta where aspen parkland is being conserved. This area maintains high densities of native ungulates including elk (Cervus elaphus), bison (Bison bison bison, B. bison athabascae), moose (Alces alces), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and mule deer (O. hemionus). Our objective was to evaluate spatiotemporal overlap and interspecific interactions between bison and elk in EINP using camera traps. Bison and elk have overlapping habitat use and diet and are the primary focus of ungulate management in EINP. We examined distributions of both species in relation to season, landscape characteristics, anthropogenic features, and heterospecifics using generalized linear models (GLMs). We then examined seasonal daily activity patterns of bison and elk and calculated the degree of overlap. The spatial analysis revealed that bison counts were positively associated with higher proportions of open habitats across seasons and in areas farther from water in summer and fall but had no associations with distance to water during winter. Bison removal year (years during which bison removals were conducted by Parks Canada) was a significant predictor variable for bison counts in winter when the bison roundup takes place. Elk avoided areas with high linear feature density across seasons. During fall and winter, we observed higher elk counts associated with bison presence. Temporal activity patterns revealed that elk were crepuscular in all three seasons, but bison activity patterns varied with diurnal activity being more common in the summer, crepuscular activity in winter, and intermediate activity patterns during fall. Coefficients of overlap between elk and bison were high in all three seasons with the greatest difference in daily activity patterns in summer and the highest overlap in winter when both species showed strong crepuscular activity. Despite the fenced perimeter in EINP resulting in high ungulate densities, limited dispersal, and low predation, our data show patterns of habitat use and interactions between bison and elk that were similar to those in other systems. Spatiotemporal partitioning does not appear necessary for coexistence of bison and elk in the aspen parkland.

AB  - The semi-domesticated nature of the reindeer (Rangifer tarandus L.) makes it a distinct case among the world's herbivores. Here, we review the literature on how reindeer shape vegetation and soil carbon and nitrogen cycles in northernmost Fennoscandia. We first describe main historical events that shaped the present-day grazing patterns in the different countries, then discuss the methodological considerations needed for interpreting evi-dence from grazer exclosures in ecological and environmental contexts. We argue that it is critical to be aware that these experiments do not measure the effect of grazing per se, but rather, they measure the responses of existing ecosystem structure and function to the sudden cessation of grazing in an environment, which was to a large degree shaped by it. Studies show that the direction and the magnitude of the effects of reindeer on vegetation and soil processes vary across habitats and depend on both the current land-uses and the historically formed grazing regimes; knowledge of the history is thus a key prerequisite for understanding the role of reindeer in ecosystems. As a general trend, reindeer affect soil nutrient cycles to a stronger extent in subarctic than in boreal ecosystems. In sites where reindeer have changed soil nutrient availability, they indirectly modify vegetation and productivity even after the cessation of grazing. We reason that the concepts of cultural and natural landscapes are not mutually exclusive in the case of reindeer ranges. Understanding how the intensity and seasonal timing of both past and present grazing direct ecosystem changes under climate warming is crucial for predicting future ecosystem structures and functioning in northern Fennoscandia as well as ecosystems in general.

AB  - Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) evolved in grasslands with a diet composed of highly nutritious forbs. However, pronghorn habitat throughout North America has been lost to fragmentation and degradation. Additionally, the effects different cattle grazing regimes have on forb biomass, protein, and energy production for pronghorn are not well known in West Texas. We sampled forbs during the growing season in the months of September 2018 and 2019 to assess the effects of different cattle grazing regimes on forbs. We hypothesized rotational grazing would increase the nutritional quality of the forb community and overall forb production, compared to continuous grazing and no grazing. We randomly sampled pastures subject to continuous and rotational grazing, as well as ungrazed exclosures using 100, 96, and 64 1 m(2) plots, respectively. We collected all forbs in each plot and analyzed differences in nutritional composition and biomass production using redundancy analysis. We found that the effects of grazing varied by year. In wetter conditions, rotational grazing exhibited higher forb quality and biomass, while exclusion from grazing exhibited these results under drier conditions. The knowledge gained from this study helps resource professionals and landowners understand how cattle grazing affects forbs for pronghorn. This knowledge may be used to improve the suitability of pronghorn habitat through cattle grazing regimes. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Society for Range Management.

AB  - The UN declaration of the Decade of Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030 emphasizes the need for effective measures to restore ecosystems and safeguard biodiversity. Large herbivores regulate many ecosystem processes and functions; yet, their potential as a nature-based solution to buffer against long-term temporal declines in biodiversity associated with global change and restore diversity in secondary forests remains unknown. By means of an exclusion experiment, we tested experimentally the buffering effects of large wild herbivores to avert against long-term biodiversity collapse in old-growth and secondary tropical forests in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil where sapling abundance and species richness declined c. 20% over the course of 10 years. The experiment comprised 50 large herbivore exclosure-open control plot pairs (25 at the old-growth forest and 25 at the secondary forest), where 2 m(2) were monitored in every plot during a 10-year period. Large herbivores were able to decelerate diversity declines and compositional change in the species-rich old-growth forest, but only decelerated compositional change in the secondary forest. In contrast, declines in species richness and abundance were unaffected by large herbivores on either forest. The buffering effects of large herbivores were strongly nonlinear and contingent on the initial level of diversity at the patch scale: highly diverse communities suffered the strongest collapse in the absence of large herbivores. Thus, larger buffering effects of large herbivores on the old-growth forest are the logical consequence of large herbivores buffering the many high diversity plant communities found in this forest. Conversely, as the secondary forest held fewer high diversity patches, buffering effects on the secondary forest were weak. Synthesis and applications. Our study indicates that large herbivores have moderate yet critical effects on slowing down community change and diversity loss of highly diverse plant communities, thus suggesting that the conservation of (and potentially trophic rewilding with) large herbivores is a fundamental nature-based solution for averting the global collapse of the strongholds of biodiversity. Its buffering effects on biodiversity loss operate at very small spatial scales, are likely contingent on successional stage and are most effective in old-growth or high diversity secondary forests.

AB  - Experimental results from a multi-year exclosure study (2009-2015) demonstrate strong effects of geese on plant cover and species diversity in an urban, restored tidal freshwater wetland. Access by geese inhibited plant establishment and suppressed plant diversity, particularly of annual plant species. Our experimental results demonstrate that the protection of newly restored tidal freshwater wetlands from geese is a make-or-break management activity that will determine the composition and long-term persistence of vegetation at the site. The causal herbivore, in this case, was resident, non-migratory Canada geese (Branta canadensis), which have increased dramatically over the last several decades and had high population densities throughout the study period. These findings suggest that management activities to reduce the population sizes of non-migratory goose populations will support greater wetland plant diversity.

AB  - Aims: Islands harbor crucial ecosystems that face expressive threats from invasive species, including goats, which have dramatically altered the vegetation dynamics of Trindade Island since their introduction in the 1700s. This study aimed to assess the effects of goats, as a primary biotic factor, alongside many abiotic factors influencing vegetation dynamics over time. Location: Trindade Island, South Atlantic Ocean. Methods: We analyzed vegetation cover changes from 1994 to 2024 using remote sensing data. We also evaluated the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and vegetation cover, and compared vegetation data obtained from fieldwork and remote sensing for 1994 and 2010. Results: A supervised classification approach was applied to identify vegetation types, achieving an overall accuracy of 89% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.8. The NDVI analysis explained 77% of the variation in vegetation cover, revealing increases in forest (65.06 ha) and grassland (325.14 ha) by 2024. No significant differences were found between fieldwork and remote sensing data (p > 0.05) for the earlier years analyzed. Although goats had a notable impact on vegetation (D-2 >= 0.75), their influence was amplified by abiotic factors, producing statistically significant correlations (D-2 >= 0.91) in generalized linear models. Incorporating both biotic and abiotic variables yielded models with higher explanatory power. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the complex interplay between goats and abiotic factors shaping vegetation dynamics on Trindade Island. The study highlights the necessity of targeted conservation strategies to mitigate the impact of invasive species on island ecosystems.

AB  - The ongoing loss of large trees and densification of shrubs are two prevalent processes that take place in African savannas, with profound consequences for their structure and function. We evaluated herbivore impacts on savanna woody communities using a long-term exclosure experiment in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, with three treatments: the exclusion of large mammals only (i.e. elephant and giraffe), exclusion of all herbivores larger than a hare, and areas open to all herbivores. We asked three questions: (1) How did variable exclusion of herbivores affect woody density and structure across the catena (i.e. riparian, sodic and crest vegetation)? (2) Did the exclusion of herbivores result in unique woody species composition? (3) Did herbivore exclusion result in a higher proportion of palatable species? After 17 years, we found that herbivores mainly affected the heights and densities of existing species, rather than leading to turnover of woody species assemblages. Although densities of individuals increased in the full exclosure (350 ha(-1)), the change was more moderate than expected. By contrast, mixed mega-and meso-herbivores decreased the number of trees and shrubs (decreases of 780 ha(-1)) via a variety of physical impacts. Meso-herbivores alone, on the other hand, had less impact on individual density (i.e. no change), but limited average height growth and canopy dimensions in certain habitat types. Where elephants are present, they are effective at reducing the density of woody stems to the point of counteracting woody encroachment, but at the same time are actively preventing the persistence of large trees (> 5 m) as well as preventing trees from recruiting to larger size classes. However, the lack of massive recruitment and woody cover increases with elephant exclusion, especially for more preferred species, suggests that factors beyond elephants, such as dispersal limitation, seed predation, and drought, are also acting upon species.

AB  - Dung beetles provide essential ecosystem services and serve as biodiversity indicators. Despite their importance, no studies have assessed their role in Pinus palustris (Longleaf Pine) forests. We assessed dung beetle diversity and abundance in a pristine Longleaf Pine forest in southwest Georgia, USA, by collecting beetles with pitfall traps in sites that excluded mammalian mesopredators as well as unfenced control sites. We collected 22 dung beetle taxa in total over a 24-month period and found higher beetle abundance and species richness in exclosure sites, though they showed no preference for dung source (i. e., Odocoileus virginianus [White- tailed Deer], Lynx rufus [Bobcat], Canis latrans [Coyote]). Melanocanthon bispinatus was the most abundant species (49.6% of total beetles). Results provide insight into the interactions of dung beetles and predators in Longleaf Pine ecosystems.

AB  - Resource selection by animals varies depending on spatial and temporal context, thus it is important to account for these factors when conducting studies that examine this behavior relative to the availability and distribution of resources. Many resource selection studies combine fine-scale animal location data obtained using global positioning system (GPS) technology and coarse-scale, remotely sensed, spatial layers. Fewer studies combine fine-scale animal location data with vegetation data collected in the field, which can identify important fine-scale drivers of resource selection. Understanding fine-scale resource selection of ungulates inhabiting regions dominated by closed-canopy forests may provide important information regarding management actions that improve habitat quality. From April 2021 to August 2022, we conducted vegetation surveys at locations (n = 1294) used by 39 GPS-collared elk Cervus canadensis and at paired random locations (n = 2509) available to elk. We used conditional logistic regressions to compare seasonal (spring, summer, fall, winter) vegetation characteristics between used and available locations. We also conducted a species indicator analysis to compare plant species found at used and available locations during peak foraging periods (dawn/dusk). Regardless of season, the probability of use by elk increased as tree basal area (m2/ha) decreased, and the presence of herbaceous plants increased. Clovers (Trifolium spp.) were indicators of locations used by elk during primary foraging periods regardless of season. Other plants that were indicators of locations used by elk during at least one season included purple-crown vetch Securigera varia, bird's foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus, and black medick Medicago lupulina. This research highlights the importance of managed openings, ecotones, and other communities characterized by reduced tree cover and increased herbaceous plants to meet the foraging needs of elk in landscapes dominated by closed-canopy forests. Creating and maintaining managed herbaceous openings and restoring open-forest communities will likely facilitate elk population growth and expansion.

AB  - Across Japan, populations of Sika deer (Cervus nippon) have grown rapidly over recent decades, and Odaigahara has particularly high densities of Sika deer. In Odaigahara, this overpopulation has led to changes in stream flow and riparian landscapes, with formerly diverse communities of dwarf bamboo growing increasingly homogenous. Lower-layer vegetation (Sasamorpha borealis, Sasa nipponica, bryophytes) that had covered Odaigahara disappeared, the number of trees of higher-layer vegetation decreased, and the landscape changed from a humid, dense landscape to a bright, homogenous landscape. Vegetation plays an important role in the succession of benthic invertebrates in streams. In this study, we examined changes in the benthic invertebrate assemblages of Odaigahara and related them to vegetation history. In 2006, there were fewer individuals and genera of benthic invertebrates than in 1983. Benthic invertebrate composition also differed from 1983 and the degree of difference varied by stream basin. The abundance of Ephemeroptera (e.g. Drunella spp.) was decreased and of Plecoptera (e.g. Sweltsa spp.) was increased. Over the same period, lower-layer vegetation and humidity decreased while temperature increased; these factors also likely contribute to the observed changes to benthic invertebrate assemblages.Implications for conservation: The forests of Odaigahara are still subject to complex factors such as sika deer, human activities and global environmental changes. Comparison of current and historical benthic invertebrate communities will help to identify the restoration goals for the forest ecosystems necessary for benthic invertebrate communities. Proper management of deer and conservation of remnant vegetation, including rhizomes, in the Odaigahara will contribute to the maintenance of the present and future benthic invertebrate community.

AB  - There is widespread concern that cessation of grazing in historically grazed ecosystems is causing biotic homogenization and biodiversity loss. We used 12 montane grassland sites along an 800 km north-south gradient across the UK, to test whether cessation of grazing affects local alpha- and beta-diversity of below-ground food webs. We show cessation of grazing leads to strongly decreased alpha-diversity of most groups of soil microbes and fauna, particularly of relatively rare taxa. By contrast, the beta-diversity varied between groups of soil organisms. While most soil microbial communities exhibited increased homogenization after cessation of grazing, we observed decreased homogenization for soil fauna after cessation of grazing. Overall, our results indicate that exclusion of domesticated herbivores from historically grazed montane grasslands has far-ranging negative consequences for diversity of below-ground food webs. This underscores the importance of grazers for maintaining the diversity of below-ground communities, which play a central role in ecosystem functioning.

AB  - The world's terrestrial biomes are broadly classified according to the dominant plant growth forms that define ecosystem structure and processes. Although the abundance and distribution of different plant growth forms can be strongly determined by factors such as climate and soil composition, large mammalian herbivores have a strong impact on plant communities, thus defaunation (the local or functional extinction of large animals) has the potential to alter the compositional structure of plant growth forms in natural ecosystems. Tropical rainforests sustain a high diversity of growth forms, including trees, palms, lianas, shrubs, herbs and bamboos, all of which play important ecosystem functions. Here, we experimentally evaluate how large mammalian herbivores affect the dominance, diversity and coexistence of these major tropical forest plant growth forms, by monitoring communities of saplings on the understorey in 43 paired exclusion plots in a long-term replicated exclusion experiment in the understorey of the Atlantic forest of Brazil. Over the course of 10 years large herbivore exclusion decreased diversity among growth forms, increased the absolute abundance of palms and trees (22% and 38% respectively) and increased the diversity of species within these two groups, to the detriment of other growth forms. Furthermore, all pairwise relationships between growth forms were positive on plots where herbivores had access, whereas several strong negative relationships emerged in plots where herbivores were excluded. This occurred despite strong background directional temporal trends affecting plant communities in both experimental treatments across the region. Synthesis. Our work indicates that the defaunation alters growth form dominance by favouring palms and trees while eroding diversity among growth forms and coexistence on a temporal scale. Large herbivore mammals promote diversity among growth forms, preventing the hyper-dominance of trees and palms, yet without supressing the diversity of species within growth forms. We argue that large herbivore mammals affect growth forms through several non-mutually exclusive mechanisms, including herbivory, seed dispersal and physical disturbance, as well as differential effects linked to the morphological and physiological adaptations of growth forms. We conclude that defaunation might lead to profound impacts on important ecosystem functions underpinned by growth form diversity, and result in vertical and horizontal structural simplification of tropical rainforests.

AB  - Island species play important roles in local ecosystems, but they are undergoing unprecedented rates of extinction from a variety of threats including emerging infectious disease, invasive species, and climate change. These threats are of particular concern for island species because island species often have limited genetic or geographic ability to escape these threats. Little is known about the long-term population trends of the Island Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma insularis), a species endemic to Santa Cruz Island in California's Channel Islands. We used a 20-year mark-resight dataset to describe long-term trends in Island Scrub-Jay adult population growth, survival, and recruitment, and to relate those trends to major drivers of island endemic extinctions (including disease, invasive species, and climate change). We used a variance components analysis to separate sampling and process variance and identified population declines of similar to 1.8% annually that were driven by a reduction in adult survival in the later years of the study. Although we found little evidence for impacts of disease and climate, we found some evidence that observed declines coincided with timing of an increasing wild turkey population but were not correlated with feral sheep or pig presence or eradication. We discuss these findings in the context of previous population estimates for this species and current management actions being considered to conserve the Island Scrub-Jay.

AB  - Herbivores shape vegetation by suppressing certain plant species while benefitting others. By thus modifying plant species functional composition, herbivores affect carbon cycling, albedo, vegetation structure and species' interactions. These effects have been suggested to be able to counteract the effects of increasing temperatures on vegetation in alpine environments. Managing the dominant large ungulates in these ecosystems could thus provide a tool to mitigate climate change effects. However, it is possible that legacy effects of past grazing will dampen ungulate impacts on vegetation. We shed a light on this topic by investigating the short- and long-term effects of varying sheep densities on the plant trait composition in the Norwegian alpine tundra with centuries-long of intensive grazing history. In the first part of our study, we quantified the effects of sheep on the plant community functional trait composition at different elevations and under moderate and low productivity in. We combined data from two long-term (14 and 19 yr) sheep fence experiments and showed that differences in sheep densities did not affect plant trait composition, irrespective of productivity. However, in the second part of our study, we showed that the plant trait composition in mainland (that has been grazed for centuries) differed from vegetation on islands which have been herbivore-free. Taken together, these results suggest that sheep have an effect on the alpine plant communities on historical time scales covering centuries, but that the resulting sheep grazing resistant/tolerant communities may not respond to shorter-term (14 and 19 yr) changes in sheep densities, that is, at temporal scales relevant for ecosystem management. Furthermore, we showed that the plant trait composition at the site with low productivity had gone through a temporal trait change independent of sheep treatment, potentially due to increased temperatures and precipitation, suggesting that sheep may not be able to counteract climatic impacts in the areas with centuries-long grazing history.

AB  - Abundant food resources in riparian zones provide efficient foraging sites for waterbirds. Herbivory is a key ecosystem process that has widely recognized effects on primary production and vegetation structure and composition. However, there is limited understanding of impacts of waterbird herbivory on riparian zone vegetation. In this study, a bird exclosure experiment with five levels of foraging intensities (no foraging, very little foraging, light foraging, moderate foraging and heavy foraging) was set up in Shengjin Lake to study the effects of waterbird foraging on the community structure of sedge meadows and individual traits of the dominant plant Carex thunbergii. Foraging intensity had little effect on community structure. The dry mass of C. thunbergii decreased with the increasing foraging time. Waterbird foraging reduced leaf dry mass under heavy foraging by 27.7% and root dry mass by 45.6% compared to CK (no foraging). Waterbird foraging increased allocation to shoot growth but had a weak effect on elemental allocation of C. thunbergii. The foraging intensity significantly affected the morphological traits of C. thunbergii. The results of structural equation modeling showed that RSR (root: shoot ratio represents the ratio of dry mass) and RL (root length) are key traits in driving the dry mass decline in the presence of bird foraging. This study may contribute to a better understanding of the adaptability of perennial herb plants to waterbird foraging and maintain the healthy development of wetland ecosystems.

AB  - Despite the large body of theory concerning multiple disturbances, relatively few attempts have been made to test the theoretical assumptions of how and if disturbances interact. Of particular importance is whether disturbance events are linked, as this can influence the probability and intensity of ecological change. Disturbances are linked when one disturbance event increases or decreases the likelihood or extent of another. To this end, we used two long-term, multi-disturbance experiments in northern Wisconsin to determine whether earthworm invasion is linked to canopy gap creation and white-tailed deer browsing. These three disturbances are common and influential within North American temperate forests, making any interactions among them particularly important to understand. We expected both deer and canopy gaps to favor invasive earthworms, particularly species that live close to or on the soil surface. However, we found only partial support of our hypotheses, as both deer exclosures and canopy gaps decreased earthworms in each experiment. Further, earthworm density increased the most over time in areas far from the gap center and in areas with deer present. Deer exclosures primarily decreased Aporrectodea and Lumbricus species, while gaps decreased Dendrobaena and Lumbricus species. Our findings show that earthworm invasion is linked to deer presence and gap-creating disturbances, which provides new insight in multiple disturbance theory, aboveground-belowground dynamics, and temperate forest management.

AB  - The frequency of severe wildfires is on the rise in the Mediterranean Basin as a result of climate change and land abandonment. Recurrent wildfires may retard or impede ecosystem recovery, frequently requiring the implementation of restoration practices. In that context, a post-fire deer exclusion experiment was conducted in a Mediterranean mixed forest ecosystem with high population densities of deer species (Fallow deer and Red deer). A deer exclusion area was established as a form of restoration intervention to promote post-fire vegetation recovery. We surveyed plant species during the second and third springs after fire in both deer-excluded and deer-allowed areas in order to detect changes in the community. We analyzed the plant species composition, species diversity, and structure of herbaceous and woody plant communities. We also compared the frequency of annual and perennial herb species, functional groups, and post-fire plant regeneration strategies. The main differences were due to differences between springs rather than of deer-excluded and deer-allowed plots. Deer consumed both woody and herbaceous species, favoring the assemblage of herbaceous over woody species. Deer favored the establishment of annual forbs, including unpalatable and/or exotic species, while limiting the abundance of graminoids. Observed deer impacts could have been magnified during the second spring by a drought. Our study demonstrates that deer exclusion can be an effective restoration practice for promoting post-fire herbaceous regeneration in forests with significant densities of wild ungulates, although seasonal effects may override restoration practice effects.

AB  - Feral hogs modify ecosystems by consuming native species and altering habitat structure. These invasions can generate fundamentally different post-invasion habitats when disturbance changes community structure, ecosystem function, or recovery dynamics. Here, we use multiple three-year exclusion experiments to describe how feral hogs affect hyper-productive brackish marshes over time. We find that infrequent yet consistent hog foraging and trampling suppresses dominant plants by generating a perpetually disturbed habitat that favors competitively inferior species and disallows full vegetative recovery over time. Along borders between plant monocultures, trampling destroys dominant graminoids responsible for most aboveground marsh biomass while competitively inferior plants increase fivefold. Hog activities shift the brackish marsh disturbance regime from pulse to press, which changes the plant community: competitively inferior plants increase coverage, species diversity is doubled, and live cover is lowered by 30% as large plants are unable to take hold in hog-disturbed areas. Release from disturbance does not result in complete recovery (i.e., dominant plant monocultures) because hog consumer control is a combination of both top-down control and broader engineering effects. These results highlight how habitats are susceptible to invasive effects outside of structural destruction alone, especially if large consumers are pervasive over time and change the dynamics that sustain recovery.

AB  - Studies on the impacts of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter deer) herbivory on vegetation biomass and nutritional availability are limited. Considering deer can shift plant species composition and abundance through selective browsing, we sought to investigate whether deer could influence their own nutritional carrying capacity. Using paired control and exclosure experimental units constructed in 2000 on three Wildlife Management Areas in the Upper Coastal Plain, Lower Coastal Plain, and Mississippi Alluvial Valley (hereafter Delta) ecoregions of Mississippi, we collected biomass samples following methods initially used on the sites in 2005. Biomass data were collected during July - August of 2021 at 15 random sampling points per experimental unit. Additionally, representative samples of each plant species were collected and analyzed for crude protein content to determine nutritional carrying capacity. By analyzing biomass data from 2005 and 2021, we found between-year differences, but no differences by treatment (exclosure vs. control). Notably, there was a simultaneous increase in shade tolerant species and decrease in shade intolerant species from 2005 to 2021, and a decrease in preferred forage species. Nutritional carrying capacity was only determined using 2021 data and revealed a lack of treatment effects. The differences between ecoregions demonstrated abundant low quality forage on both Coastal Plain sites (Upper and Lower) and a comparatively low amount of forage that was higher in quality in the Delta. Results suggest changing understory light conditions and a need for additional management if increasing available forage for deer is a desired management outcome. Specifically, regional differences in nutritional availability between the Coastal Plain sites and the Delta site illustrate the potential for active management to aid in the promotion of herbaceous understory forage species.

AB  - Tree-removal treatments have been broadly applied across pinon-juniper ecosystems of the western United States to reduce tree cover, stimulate understory plant production, and promote habitat for shrub- and grassland-obligate wildlife species. Mastication treatments have become an increasingly common approach, yet the efficacy of these treatments can vary on the basis of a variety of factors, including soil characteristics, woodland structure, and grazing pressures. Here, we assessed vegetation responses to mastication treatments across three dominant soil types in two-needle pinon (Pinus edulis Engelm. [Pinaceae])- one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma [Engelm.] Sarg.) woodlands in southeast Colorado, United States, a region characterized by monsoonal precipitation, limited presence of introduced plant species, and relatively high grazing intensity by cattle and wildlife. We found that mastication treatments were effective at increasing herbaceous plant cover and species diversity (by 1.2 x and 1.5 x) and at reducing the amount of exposed soil (60% reduction) 3 yr following treatment. This was mainly due to increases in native perennial grasses. Further, there were limited (and insignificant) increases in cover of annual plants and low abundance of introduced species in treated plots. Understory plant responses to treatment were similar across soils with a range of available water capacities. The increase in understory plant cover and richness paired with the low abundance of introduced species suggests that mastication treatments increase forage production for cattle and wild ungulates. In addition, the lack of soil type differences in treatment response suggests that mastication treatment placement does not need to prioritize soil type and can instead focus on other key areas of importance, such as wildlife habitat connectivity, historic woodland structure, and treatment feasibility.

AB  - Herbivory serves as a critical top-down mechanism within plant communities by regulating biodiversity, productivity, and ecosystem function. Although top-down impacts of mammalian herbivores have garnered significant fi cant attention in the literature, fewer studies have investigated the role of herbivorous reptiles, which can serve as crucial herbivores for some ecosystems, in regulating plant communities. In southeastern coastal plain longleaf pine forests of the United States, Gopher Tortoises ( Gopherus polyphemus) ) are a keystone species that may suppress plant productivity and promote local diversity within hyperdiverse understory plant communities. In January 2019, we established permanent tortoise exclusion plots with corresponding accessible control plots within an active Gopher Tortoise population at Splinter Hill Bog Preserve in southwestern Alabama. We measured the response of plant species diversity, composition, and productivity through a single growing season to quantify short-term impacts of tortoise exclusion on understory plant communities. We found that tortoise exclusion plots had 35% % more plant cover, with a 15% % reduction in plant richness, 6% % reduction in evenness, and 12% % reduction in Shannon's diversity, relative to control plots. Within a single growing season, tortoise exclusion explained 5% % of the variation within overall plant community composition. Our results provide clear evidence on the role of Gopher Tortoise herbivory for the maintenance of plant diversity within species-rich longleaf pine forests of the southeastern United States, even across a single growing season.

AB  - Aims Classical theory predicts that herbivores impact herb assemblages and soil nitrogen (N) cycling through selective plant consumption and the deposition of N-rich waste, with effects dependent upon ecosystem N availability. Herbivores are predicted to accelerate N cycling when N availability is high and decelerate cycling when availability is low. However, experimental tests of these theories in natural systems are limited and have yielded contradictory results. California's widespread chaparral shrublands provide a tractable system in which to test these theories. They are prone to periodic crown fire, which temporarily removes living shrub cover, deposits mineral N on soils and allows diverse herbaceous assemblages to dominate the landscape for 3-5 years. Chaparral is also increasingly vulnerable to herbaceous invasion; mammalian herbivory may limit the establishment of non-native herbs in the shrub understory.
   Methods We implemented a 2-year herbivore-exclosure experiment (Hopland, CA) to assess the impact of mammalian herbivory during early post-fire chaparral succession, both on herbaceous plant assemblages and soil N and C cycling. We predicted that, in high-N post-fire conditions, mammalian herbivory would not demonstrate a strong preference for N-fixing herbs, would accelerate N cycling and would reduce the abundance of non-native herbs.
   Important Findings Excluding mammalian herbivores increased herb standing biomass by 54%, but changed neither the relative abundance of N-fixing vs. non-N-fixing herbs nor any measure of N or C cycling. Herbivore impacts on nutrient cycling may not be significant over the 2-year time scale of the experiment and physical effects of herbivore activity could have counteracted the influence of plant litter and animal dung/urine inputs. Mammalian herbivores concentrated their feeding on typical non-native herbs, slightly decreasing their relative abundance; however, mammalian herbivory was not sufficient to stem the invasion of chaparral by invasive herbs or alter C and N cycling over the first 2 years after fire.

AB  - High densities of native and introduced deer hamper the regeneration of temperate forests worldwide. Sport hunting is often the sole means of deer control, but whether it can restore forest regeneration remains uncertain.We assessed the potential to restore forest regeneration using unrestricted sport hunting alongside commercial harvesting and government-funded culling of introduced sika deer (Cervus nippon) across a 594 km2 landscape in North Island, New Zealand. We used six decades of repeated measurements of forest regeneration and deer presence, alongside monitoring of tagged stems in a 20-year paired exclosure experiment, to determine whether deer control restored regeneration.In our exclosure experiment, mountain beech (Fuscospora cliffortioides) seedling and sapling density, growth and survival were variable but consistently higher when deer were excluded by fencing. Sapling counts in unfenced plots were approximate to 3-10 times lower after 60 years of deer control compared with unfenced plots, before sika colonisation and other mountain beech forests without sika deer. This result suggests canopy replacement remains at risk despite government-funded culling and encouragement of sport hunting.Individual-based demographic models show that mountain beech is unlikely to regenerate following canopy gap formation in our study landscape unless deer impacts are reduced from current levels. These demographic models predicted present-day forest regeneration far better than two widely used proxies of deer impact: plot-based counts of saplings and estimates of deer densities from faecal pellet counts.Synthesis and applications. Here, we show that intensive culling beyond that achievable by sport hunting is needed to reduce deer densities enough to assure canopy regeneration. These interventions will be necessary in the many places worldwide where sport hunting is being relied upon to protect forests but appears to be failing. Given the controversy associated with deer culling, and the need for clear evidence to justify its implementation, we suggest managers could strengthen the evidence base for their interventions by collecting data to build demographic models.

AB  - Grazing and shrub encroachment are major drivers of vegetation types and soils characteristics in arid and semiarid areas. However, the effects of grazing on shrub growth, particularly soil properties and plant reproductive traits, remain largely unexplored. Here, we conducted three long-term sheep grazing intensity experiments (e.g., no-grazing, moderate grazing, and heavy grazing) in Inner Mongolia to explore how different grazing intensities affect the distributions of soil property heterogeneity and reproductive traits of the dominant shrub species in the desert steppe, Reaumuria songarica. This study highlights the significant effects of grazing on soil properties, plant reproduction, and ecosystem heterogeneity in desert grasslands. Grazing modifies soil physicochemical properties by increasing soil moisture, bulk density, and nutrient content beneath shrubs, with these effects varying by soil depth, canopy width, and specific soil characteristics. Grazing enhances soil heterogeneity for carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, particularly in surface and deeper soil layers, while reducing heterogeneity in pH and surface phosphorus, thereby intensifying fertile island effects. Regarding plant reproduction, grazing reduces female fitness and seed quantity but improves seed quality. Overgrazing disrupts nutrient partitioning, negatively impacting reproductive traits. Shrub mound height and canopy cover positively influence reproductive success, yet changes in soil heterogeneity alter nutrient allocation, further affecting reproduction. Therefore, targeted grazing management is essential in arid ecosystems to balance soil quality, enhance plant reproduction, and promote rangeland sustainability.

AB  - We evaluated patterns of herbivory and predation/scavenging by a small mammal, the arctic ground squirrel (Urocitellus parryii), as an indicator of biological diversity, vegetation structure, and ecological integrity on two contrasting islands in the vast and remote Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. Using DNA metabarcoding techniques, we assessed the taxonomic composition of vertebrates, vascular plants, and bryophytes at family and growth form levels in arctic ground squirrel fecal samples collected on the ecologically intact island of Chowiet, which supports diverse seabird and vegetation communities, and the degraded island of Chirikof, which has incurred centuries of disturbance from introduced arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) and cattle (Bos taurus taurus). We also evaluated whether fecal samples collected across the growing season (May-August) could act as indicators of herbivore-plant phenology. We did not detect any vertebrate taxa, however, observed herbivory patterns closely matched known differences in island plant diversity based on independent surveys. Diets from the ecologically intact island exhibited higher taxonomic richness, greater evenness, and higher shrub content than the ecologically degraded island, which is a grass- and forb-dominated ecosystem. On Chowiet Island, diets changed seasonally, likely in response to changing availability, nutritional quality, and toxin content associated with primary production. Small mammal diet served as an effective indicator of plant diversity, vegetation structure, and ecological integrity when compared against known composition and status of these remote island ecosystems. Non-invasive fecal sampling and dietary analyses using genetic techniques may provide a useful strategy for monitoring biological diversity, particularly in remote areas where widespread intensive sampling is unfeasible.

AB  - Societal Impact StatementTo better understand the impact of human settlement on vegetation distribution and disturbance regimes in Madagascar, the 2021 Malagasy Grassy Biomes Workshop called for an examination of the role of extinct megafauna in determining the historic distribution of habitat mosaics across regions that are today dominated by vast treeless grasslands. A systematic literature review facilitated the reconstruction and evaluation of giant tortoise habitat, feeding habitats, diets and Aldabrachelys tortoise impacts on disturbance regimes. In conclusion, reintroduction of mixed-feeding Aldabrachelys (the diets of which were often dominated by C-3 woody material, but never by C-4 grasses, across its range), will likely impact plant species composition, select a tree-rich habitat mosaic, reduce fire frequency, re-establish lost ecological functions and improve landscape productivity at a range of scales, including rangeland palatability, benefitting both biodiversity and human wellbeing.SummaryGrasslands with little tree cover today comprise 80% of Madagascar's habitat. Determining their extent at human settlement can guide ecological restoration and enhance human well-being, so the 2021 Malagasy Grassy Biomes Workshop identified the role of extinct megafauna in determining habitat as a critical knowledge gap. Using a systematic literature review, combined with extracted datasets, we address this, examining anticipated habitat selection by giant tortoises following reintroduction to Madagascar (where the Aldabran giant tortoise, Aldabrachelys gigantea, provides ecological functions lost when A. abrupta and A. grandidieri went extinct). When comparing current and historical tortoise selection of habitat across the Mascarenes and Aldabra with contemporary Malagasy habitat, areas in Madagascar where giant tortoises historically ranged, today have a significantly different habitat composition to the forested habitat that supported giant tortoises on other islands. Dietary C-13 isotope ratios show that Malagasy Aldabrachelys and Mascarene tortoises were mixed feeders, with diets often dominated by C-3 woody intake, but never by C-4 grasses. Across systems, giant tortoises required and selected, tree-rich habitat mosaics, different to current pastoralist fire-selected Malagasy grasslands characterized by sparse tree cover. Furthermore, Aldabran Aldabrachelys tortoise turf, restricted to small areas (large tracts of unshaded vegetation present physiological challenges to Aldabrachelys' survival), is compositionally different to Malagasy and African obligate C-4 grazing lawns. Ecological, palaeoecological, geomorphological and molecular evidence support a lost Malagasy habitat mosaic where hippo and tortoise diets were C-3-dominated, because they inhabited closed-canopy systems, with abutting open-canopy areas harbouring endemic-rich, C-4 grassy understories and limited grasslands. The review suggests that rewilding with A. gigantea will help restore ecological functions, productivity and landscape-scale degradation lost through cattle-based pastoralism, re-establish tree-rich habitat mosaics, and mitigate against frequent bushfires, benefiting biodiversity and humans at multiple scales.

AB  - QuestionMammalian herbivory affects the structure and composition of plant communities, soil characteristics and intraspecific leaf traits. Understanding the effects of this type of herbivory is particularly relevant in grey dunes, a priority habitat type of the European Union Habitats Directive.LocationS & aacute;lvora island (NW Spain).MethodsVegetation surveys and sampling were carried out in a coastal grey-dune community, comparing the structure and composition of plant communities and soil characteristics in plots with herbivory exclusion and plots with herbivore activity, in autumn and spring. Changes in the specific leaf area (SLA), C/N ratio, delta 13C and delta 15N of two main plant species were also analysed.ResultsThe differentiation between treatments was low in autumn, in contrast to spring results, which demonstrated seasonal variation in the plant community and herbivore behaviour. Spring results showed lower above-ground dry mass in plots with herbivory due to defoliation, but greater richness and diversity, indicating that intermediate levels of disturbance reduced competition from dominant species. Herbivory treatments were different in terms of species composition, highlighting the positive effects of herbivory on the development of the threatened species Linaria arenaria. Soil temperature and moisture content were higher in herbivory plots because of the suppression of vegetation cover and the effect of trampling, respectively. No differences were detected in the chemical composition of the soil or the SLA, although the variability of these traits was greater in herbivory plots, indicating spatial heterogeneity generated by the activity of herbivores. No differences between treatments were obtained for % C and delta 13C, whereas herbivory plots showed lower values of N content and delta 15N as an adaptive response to herbivory pressure at the leaf and root level.ConclusionOur findings show that herbivory effects on plant communities vary by season - stronger in spring and weaker in autumn - emphasising the need for seasonal analysis and highlighting disturbance as a driver of spatial heterogeneity.

AB  - Over the last +150 years, increases in woody vegetation in drylands and associated declines in herbaceous vegetation have led to widespread interest in reversing this trend. However, the effects of native, noncharismatic herbivores, such as lagomorphs, on these efforts are largely unknown. For 11 years post-treatment, we quantified the effects of native lagomorphs on restoration efforts in sagebrush (Artemisia L.) communities exhibiting legacy effects of past management, including depleted understories and overabundant sagebrush. Reducing sagebrush and seeding perennial grasses was necessary to attain substantial increases in large perennial grass cover and density, but this outcome was realized only with lagomorph exclusion. A small native bunchgrass and perennial forb cover and density increased in all treatments with lagomorph exclusion. This suggests that lagomorphs contribute to the persistence of a depleted understory in areas with increased woody vegetation. In areas where sagebrush was reduced, the cover and density of sagebrush was greater with lagomorph exclusion. This suggests that lagomorphs could hinder sagebrush recovery after disturbances that reduce or eliminate sagebrush. Lagomorph herbivory had a substantial effect on vegetation dynamics and affected the outcome of restoration efforts in these dryland systems. This could reduce livestock forage and alter habitat of wildlife species, potentially affecting their conservation. Lagomorphs and other noncharismatic, native herbivores may facilitate the persistence of depleted understories in areas where woody plants have increased. Results of this study suggests that the potential effects of lagomorph and other native herbivores should be considered and addressed in management, restoration, and conservation plans.

AB  - Biological invasions are a major threat to the terrestrial ecosystems of the sub-Antarctic islands. While non-native plants generally have negative impacts on native arthropods, few studies have investigated how both native and non-native arthropods and plants interact in the sub-Antarctic islands. This was the aim of our study, which was conducted on three islands of the Kerguelen archipelago. The design was based on the spatial proximity of areas dominated by non-native or native plant species. Trait-based indices were calculated to characterize the functional structure of plant communities, considering plant stature and leaf traits. Native and non-native vegetation had contrasting functional composition but their functional diversity was similar. The effects of the type of vegetation, native or non-native, and plant functional diversity on arthropods were tested. Native macro-arthropod richness and abundance were similar or higher in non-native vegetation, and benefited from greater plant functional diversity. Abundances of macro-herbivores, macro-decomposers and macro-predators were also similar or higher in non-native vegetation. Conversely, the abundances of micro-arthropods, Symphypleona springtails and Oribatida mites, were higher in native vegetation but we also found that plant functional diversity had a negative effect on Symphypleona. Our results suggest that non-native plants can affect micro-arthropods directly or indirectly, likely through their effects on abiotic factors. By affecting macro-arthropod abundances across different trophic groups and by depleting micro-arthropods, non-native plants can alter trophic interactions, functional balances and the functioning of whole ecosystem.

AB  - In disturbance-adapted ecosystems, the removal of disturbance can lead to losses of diversity and sometimes irreversible changes in community composition. It is important to identify the thresholds at which these changes can occur, and to understand the reversibility of these shifts. We examined this question in a vernal pool ecosystem that evolved with low to moderate levels of grazing disturbance. In this system, it is not clear whether the negative effects of long-term grazing exclusion are reversible through grazing reintroduction. We compared adjacent vernal pool wetlands in annual Mediterranean grasslands under three grazing management strategies: continuously grazed (100+ years), long-term excluded (40+ years) and 2 years of reintroduced grazing. We also asked whether grazing treatments altered pool characteristics that are likely to influence plant community composition, and how these relationships changed with environmental conditions. Reintroducing grazing to vernal pools led to both increased diversity and native cover, but the effects on native cover were more immediate than on diversity. We identified several biotic and abiotic mechanisms related to this pattern, including changes to competitive dynamics that favour small statured native annuals and increases in hoofprint microdepressions that make soil moisture more available to plants. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that reintroduced grazing at moderate stocking rates can have significant effects on plant communities after just 2 years and can increase native cover more quickly than overall diversity. Our findings suggest that the negative effects of long-term grazing exclusion in vernal pools may be reversible, but that land managers interested in restoring diversity should plan to monitor beyond the first two years of grazing reintroduction.

AB  - Silviculture methods such as clearcutting, shelterwood seed cutting, and selection system are used to manipulate the canopy and regenerate new cohorts in hardwood stands. Additionally, site preparation can be utilized to alter seedbed conditions with the aim to promote changes in species composition. However, limited seed availability and increased ungulate browsing may limit successful natural regeneration in some areas. Our objective was to investigate the influence of regeneration method, site preparation, deer exclusion, and direct seeding on the regeneration of a managed northern hardwood forest. Utilizing a randomized split-plot design with three splitting levels, we examined the effects of four different regeneration methods, two site preparation treatments, seed limitation and deer browsing on composition, compositional heterogeneity, and richness of regenerating tree species. We observed significant differences in the resulting species composition related to the regeneration and site preparation methods. Shelterwood seed cutting implemented with 60% and 30% residual canopy cover, along with scarification, increased species richness and species compositional heterogeneity. However, the combination of deer exclusion and direct seeding resulted in the highest species richness across all treatment combinations. Deer exclusion alone did not enhance richness or compositional heterogeneity, highlighting the impeding effect of limited seed availability. We found that direct seeding successfully altered species composition and increased species richness. Our results suggest that while the regeneration and site preparation methods can benefit natural tree regeneration, approaches that also address both seed limitations and deer browsing will be necessary to increase the tree species diversity in some cases.

AB  - Questions: Oceanic islands are global hotspots of endemism and evolutionary radiations but many have been severely degraded by human activities and biological invasions. We evaluated the pace and direction of the natural recovery of ecosystems over 77 years across a subtropical oceanic archipelago including islands of various size, elevation, histories of human settlement and deforestation, and invasions by non-native plants and mammals. This information is essential to guide the ecological restoration of the archipelago. Location: Forest vegetation on nine of the Ogasawara Islands in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Methods: We first digitized historical vegetation data of the Ogasawara Islands collected during field surveys in 1935. Then, after checking their species compositions, we integrated past and present plant community types. Finally, we identified the landscape-scale changes in forest vegetation by comparing vegetation maps from 1935, 1979 and 2012. Results: Over 77 years, the vegetation trajectories of each island varied depending on the introduction of invasive alien species and the remaining proportion of native forest, the latter of which had a strong influence on the recoverability of native forest. Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of the history of invasive species introductions and the remaining proportion of native forest-both of which reflect the intensity of anthropogenic disturbance-in determining the degree of human intervention needed for restoration on oceanic islands.

AB  - High densities of cattle (Bos taurus) and wild ungulates (Rocky Mountain elk, Cervus canadensis; mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus) have impacted the abundance and population dynamics of palatable woody species in forests of the interior Pacific Northwest, USA. As a result, large shrubs are functionally absent from some forest stands. Physical structures can provide safe sites for browsed species to persist within forests. We evaluated the role of coarse woody debris and conifer trees in protecting a common, yet heavily browsed species, serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia) from elk, deer and cattle. We measured height and architecture of individuals and the degree to which they were protected by coarse woody debris and unpalatable conifers in areas exposed to ungulates and in ungulate exclosures. Multiple linear regression and quantile regression were used to test for the effects of protection and foliar overlap on plant height. Results showed that increased protection and foliar overlap resulted in a lower proportion of shrubs exhibiting arrested architecture. Shrub height increased as foliar overlap and protection increased, with effects primarily restricted to high levels of protection (> 300 degrees surrounded by nearby conifer trees and/or coarse woody debris). Taller shrubs were most associated with intermediate levels of foliar overlap. Results support the hypothesis that understory structural elements can act as protective barriers. Forest management actions (e.g., prescribed fire, understory thinning) that reduce the prevalence of structures may unintentionally suppress browsed shrub species and contribute to the continued functional absence of tall deciduous species in dry conifer forests.

AB  - Grazing disturbance affects an extensive area of the Monte desert (Argentina). Arthropods are the main faunistic component of the Monte and play key roles in ecosystem processes. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of grazing on the canopy arthropod assemblages that inhabit three representative shrub species of the southern Monte (Chuquiraga avellanedae, Schinus johnstonii and Larrea divaricata). Three sampling sites were established in three paddocks grazed by sheep and another three sites in a grazing exclosure. Five specimens of each shrub species were selected per site. Canopy arthropods were sampled using the beating method. The response of arthropod assemblages to grazing was found to vary among shrub species and between seasons. The assemblages associated with two shrub species (L. divaricata and C. avellanedae) were modified significantly by grazing. The most marked response was a general decrease in arthropod diversity in disturbed sites. The abundance of sap-sucking arthropods increased with grazing. These results could be related, in part, to differences in canopy architecture between grazed and ungrazed sites. This study contribute to understanding the ecological impacts of grazing on biological communities of the southern Monte and will aid in developing management strategies that improve regional biodiversity outcomes.

AB  - Ecological theory predicts the strongest ecosystem effects of herbivory when dominant and ecologically important species are consumed. Bilberry, Vaccinium myrtillus, is such a key plant species, attractive to many other species in the boreal forests, for example ungulate and invertebrate herbivores. Large herbivores may remove substantial biomass and alter plant quality and therefore affect abundance and populations of invertebrate animals sharing the same food plant. We combined experimental exclusion of ungulates with a browsing intensity gradient to investigate the 15-year effect of ungulate (Cervus elaphus and Ovis aries) browsing on bilberry plant size and on bilberry-feeding herbivorous larvae (Lepidoptera and Symphyta), in a Norwegian old growth boreal forest ecosystem. Bilberry ramets in exclosure plots had nearly nine times higher dry mass and three times higher abundance of invertebrates feeding on them than in ungulate-access plots. Sweep-netting data verified these findings as larval numbers were twice as high in exclosure plots. The pattern in the large herbivore effects on bilberry size and abundance of herbivorous larvae were identical along the browsing gradient. Differences in larval abundance between treatments, as indicated by leaf-chewing, increased during the 15-year study period, and the community fluctuations were larger when ungulate herbivores were excluded. The browsing effect was moderated by plant quality as larval densities were lowest on both heavily-browsed and non-browsed plants, and highest on ramets that had 50 similar to 74% of annual shoots browsed. Our study supports previous findings in that bilberry is relatively disturbance tolerant and may recover quickly, but that ungulates may compete with herbivorous larvae for food biomass. Additionally, our results strongly indicates that population insect community peaks and fluctuations are dampened by ungulate consumption. Our findings add to the understanding on how ungulates may structure forest ecosystems directly and indirectly. (C) 2021 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Questions Does clear-cutting intended to boost regeneration of abandoned secondary forests lead to an irreversible shift to non-forest vegetation under high deer density? Location Warm-temperate forests in Boso Peninsula, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Methods We designed a factorial experiment including two levels of forest canopy treatment (clear-cutting or intact canopy) and two levels of herbivory control (presence or absence of deer) using 24 plots of 10 m x 10 m. Vegetation dynamics occurring under each experimental treatment were tracked for 7.5 years. Results Ground vegetation under the closed canopy did not change significantly for 7.5 years both inside and outside the deer fences. However, plots were rapidly covered by early-seral plants till 1.5 years after the cutting event. The quick growth of ground vegetation after clear-cutting was supported by plants that are known to have soil seed banks, as suggested by their ubiquity immediately after clear-cutting. Species richness of ground vegetation was maximized at that time and gradually decreased afterward, suggesting biological filtering. This filtering process worked differently inside and outside the deer fences, resulting in different types of vegetation. The clear-cut-and-fence plots became dominated by tree recruits that will recover secondary forests in the future. Contrastingly, vegetation outside the fences lacked many species (e.g., common tree species) that were found inside the fences and became dominated by shrubs and plants unpalatable to deer. This post-cutting vegetation outside the fences was not similar to that inside the deer fences at any seral stage. This means that the vegetation outside the fences could be tracking an alternative successional trajectory rather than a case of arrested succession. Conclusions Here, abandoned secondary forests still seem to maintain a high regeneration potential that would be triggered by clear-cutting, but reducing herbivory pressure by deer is necessary to avoid the risk of alternative successional trajectories.

AB  - The past century witnessed a dramatic increase in deer abundance in North America, Western Europe, and Japan, that triggered profound changes in the vegetation structure of temperate forests. Considering the effects large herbivores can have on soil properties and organisms, it is likely that such increased deer abundance will have consequences belowground. Current studies in temperate forests, however, found inconsistent results regarding the effect of deer on soils within, and across, ecosystems. These inconsistencies may be the result of a timedependent response of the soil to deer presence. Short-term belowground modifications may reflect the direct interactions of deer on soil (i.e. trampling and waste deposition), while long-term belowground modifications may reflect both direct and indirect effects of deer on soil (e.g. through vegetation shifts). To test these ideas, we measured the effects of deer on soil properties and prokaryotic communities in the temperate forests of Haida Gwaii, Canada. We compared three complementary systems varying in duration of deer presence or exclusion, so as to be able to assess the short- (before and after a deer cull), intermediate- (inside vs. outside deer exclosures) and long- (comparing islands with and without deer) term effects of deer, respectively. We found no change in soil physical and chemical properties and in prokaryotic community structure after one year of deer removal. Twenty years of deer exclusion significantly reduced soil compaction but had no effect on soil prokaryotic community structure. Over 70 years of deer presence significantly correlated with: increased soil compaction, reduced total soil phosphorus content and soil prokaryotic diversity, and modified soil prokaryotic community structure and composition. Such effects of deer on the soil may have consequences for nutrient cycling. Revealing the belowground effects of deer in temperate forests, therefore, requires long-term studies, longer than most of those currently available in the literature.

AB  - 1. Given the current rates of climate change, with associated shifts in herbivore population densities, understanding the role of different herbivores in ecosystem functioning is critical for predicting ecosystem responses. Here, we examined how migratory geese and resident, non-migratory reindeer-two dominating yet functionally contrasting herbivores-control vegetation and ecosystem processes in rapidly warming Arctic tundra.
   2. We collected vegetation and ecosystem carbon (C) flux data at peak plant growing season in the two longest running, fully replicated herbivore removal experiments found in high-Arctic Svalbard. Experiments had been set up independently in wet habitat utilised by barnacle geese Branta leucopsis in summer and in moist-to-dry habitat utilised by wild reindeer Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus year-round.
   3. Excluding geese induced vegetation state transitions from heavily grazed, moss-dominated (only 4 g m(-2) of live above-ground vascular plant biomass) to ungrazed, graminoid-dominated (60 g m(-2) after 4-year exclusion) and horsetail-dominated (150 g m(-2) after 15-year exclusion) tundra. This caused large increases in vegetation C and nitrogen (N) pools, dead biomass and moss-layer depth. Alterations in plant N concentration and CN ratio suggest overall slower plant community nutrient dynamics in the short-term (4-year) absence of geese. Long-term (15-year) goose removal quadrupled net ecosystem C sequestration (NEE) by increasing ecosystem photosynthesis more than ecosystem respiration (ER).
   4. Excluding reindeer for 21 years also produced detectable increases in live above-ground vascular plant biomass (from 50 to 80 g m(-2); without promoting vegetation state shifts), as well as in vegetation C and N pools, dead biomass, moss-layer depth and ER. Yet, reindeer removal did not alter the chemistry of plants and soil or NEE.
   5. Synthesis. Although both herbivores were key drivers of ecosystem structure and function, the control exerted by geese in their main habitat (wet tundra) was much more pronounced than that exerted by reindeer in their main habitat (moist-to-dry tundra). Importantly, these herbivore effects are scale dependent, because geese are more spatially concentrated and thereby affect a smaller portion of the tundra landscape compared to reindeer. Our results highlight the substantial heterogeneity in how herbivores shape tundra vegetation and ecosystem processes, with implications for ongoing environmental change.

AB  - Despite wide recognition of the importance of anthropogenically driven changes in large herbivore communities-including both declines in wildlife and increases in livestock-there remain large gaps in our knowledge about the impacts of these changes on plant communities, particularly when combined with concurrent changes in climate. Considering these prominent forms of global change in tandem enables us to better understand controls on savanna vegetation structure and diversity under real-world conditions. We conducted a field experiment using complete and semi-permeable herbivore exclosures to explore the difference in plant communities among sites with wild herbivores only, with cattle in addition to wild herbivores, and with no large herbivores. To understand variation in effects across climatic contexts, the experiment was replicated at three locations along a topoclimatic gradient in California. Critically, this is the first such experiment to compare cattle and wildlife impacts along an environmental gradient within a single controlled experiment. Vegetation structure responded strongly to herbivore treatment regardless of climate. Relative to the isolated effects of wildlife, exclusion of all large herbivores generally increased structural components related to cover and above-ground biomass while the addition of cattle led to reductions in vegetation cover, litter, shading and standing biomass. Furthermore, wildlife had a consistent neutral or positive effect on plant diversity, while the effect of livestock addition was context dependent. Cattle had a neutral to strongly negative effect at low aridity, but a positive effect at high aridity. These results suggest that (a) herbivore effects can override climate effects on vegetation structure, (b) cattle addition can drive different effects on diversity and (c) herbivore effects on diversity are modulated by climate. Synthesis. Our results illustrate very distinctive shifts in plant communities between two realistic forms of change in ungulate herbivore assemblages-livestock addition and large herbivore losses-particularly for plant diversity responses, and that these responses vary across climatic contexts. This finding has important implications for the management and protection of plant biodiversity given that over a quarter of the Earth's land area is managed for livestock and climate regimes are changing globally.

AB  - Globally, subalpine and alpine plant communities are receiving increasing attention owing to disproportionately rapid warming at high altitudes, and the resultant habitat shrinkage leaving high-altitude specialists with nowhere to migrate. The Hawaiian subalpine zone (1,700-3,000 m) is an interesting example of this potential phenomenon because of the high endemism. We analyzed plant species richness, cover, and density from 89 plots (1,000 m(2)) sampled in 2010-2018 across two volcanic mountains, Haleakala on Maui, and Mauna Loa on Hawai'i. Most of the 139 plant species recorded were non-native (55%), with the remainder endemic (31%) and indigenous (14%). Plot-level richness differed from gamma diversity, with endemic species more abundant than non-native species. Non-native species richness was higher on Haleakala than Mauna Loa. These communities are patchy with low-lying (< 1 m) vegetation, and lower cover on younger drier Mauna Loa (36%) than Haleakala (54%). Density was largely consistent with the understory cover data, with endemic Vaccinium reticulatum (>3,500/ha) and indigenous Leptecophylla tameiameiae (>2,430/ha) shrubs dominant on both volcanoes. Woodland communities were encountered only on Mauna Loa, with endemic trees Metrosideros polymorpha on wetter, south aspects, and Sophora chrysophylla on the drier, leeward side. Hawaiian subalpine vegetation varies among islands, volcanoes, and aspects, yet remains largely native-dominated, though with increasing threats from climate change, invasive non-native species, and wildfire. We recommend continued monitoring of biotic communities and climate in this sensitive zone, in situ physiological studies for the native matrix species, stricter non-native species biosecurity and sanitation protocols, wildfire prevention, and improved documentation of the effects of feral ungulates.

AB  - Background and aimsUngulates are integral to Mediterranean ecosystems, influencing vegetation dynamics and soil microbial communities. While previous studies have documented the effects of herbivory on the soil microbiome (e.g. nitrogen-fixation groups), the impacts on root-associated fungal communities and their role in plant responses to herbivory remain poorly understood. These interactions are vital for ecosystem functioning and deserve further investigation.MethodsTo explore these interactions, we used Agrostis spp. as species model, a common grass genus, highly consumed by ungulates worldwide. Roots were sampled from areas with high ungulate activity (deer density of 25-40 ind/km2) and from adjacent 14-year ungulate exclosures to assess long-term changes in root-associated fungal communities. Additionally, Agrostis plants were grown in soils from these areas under greenhouse conditions to evaluate their regrowth capacity after simulated herbivory.ResultsThe fungal communities of the roots differed significantly between plants grown inside and outside the ungulate exclosures. Despite these differences, the regrowth capacity after simulated herbivory was not significantly affected by the soil origin (areas with and without herbivory). Plants grown in sterilized soils with recolonized fungal communities exhibited enhanced growth compared to those in untreated soils.ConclusionsThe study demonstrates that ungulate herbivory alters root-associated fungal communities in Agrostis spp., yet plant growth remains unaffected, suggesting resilient plant-fungal interactions. Our findings show that microbial diversity alone may not predict ecosystem function, emphasizing the need to consider both taxonomic and functional dimensions of soil communities in conservation strategies for Mediterranean ecosystems.

AB  - Wildlife defaunation in tropical forests disrupts critical ecological functions such as predation, seed dispersal, and nutrient cycling. While exclusion experiments are commonly used to investigate the effects of wildlife loss on plant diversity and vegetation structure, their potential impact on broader ecosystem functions remains underexplored. Here we investigate how defaunation could affect ecosystem functions in the Amazon rainforest by quantifying the changes in the occurrence and frequency of behaviors exhibited by terrestrial mammals induced by experimental defaunation. Using camera traps, we recorded vertebrate behaviors across exclusion and control plots, categorizing them into feeding, excretion/defecation, bioturbation, and trampling. We then calculated weighted standardized indices, integrating behavior frequency and body mass, to assess the potential local impacts of vertebrates across plots. We found that all behaviors were drastically reduced (>95 % reduction) under severe defaunation conditions, primarily due to the absence of medium- and large-bodied mammals and birds. In defaunated plots, small mammals partially performed some behaviors, but they were unable to compensate for the loss of larger species. These results highlight the substantial reduction in critical vertebrate behaviors and suggest that such changes can significantly disrupt ecosystem functions in defaunated tropical forests.

AB  - Conservation managers often monitor umbrella species as indicators of broader biodiversity patterns, but this assumption is seldom evaluated due to lack of survey data and objective umbrella criteria. We evaluated the performance of eight candidate umbrella species in representing broader patterns of mammal biodiversity in Sumatra, Indonesia, using a comprehensive camera trap dataset from the island's largest remaining tropical rainforest. We employed an occupancy modeling framework to quantify the association between species-level occupancy and four community-level biodiversity parameters while accounting for imperfect detection. Sambar deer and clouded leopard were consistently ranked the top umbrellas. Areas where these species were prevalent were associated with higher levels of community occupancy, species richness, functional and phylogenetic diversity. Sumatran tiger and rhino were among the lower ranked umbrellas, and inadequately represented other biodiversity parameters despite being the main subjects of monitoring. Our results demonstrate that the occurrence status of charismatic species commonly regarded as umbrellas does not necessarily represent broader patterns of biodiversity. Species that are frequently overlooked by conservation decision-making may better represent overall mammal diversity. We advocate utilizing umbrella fleets with multiple species monitored to better represent biodiversity patterns, and encourage broader application of our data-driven framework to assess umbrella species performance.

AB  - The urgent need to preserve ecosystems over vast areas has placed rewilding with wild herbivores to the forefront. However, there are still few scientific experimental field studies dealing with its effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Since 1993, in France, a socially natural population of wild horses (Equus ferus przewalskii) has been managed for its conservation. This introduction is an opportunity to compare this new management system with the multi-secular extensive sheep breeding and the more recent conventional domestic horse breeding. We sought to discover if plant communities show differences depending on the grazers and the managing system. We surveyed 208 plots divided into six grazed sites (two sites per type of grazer), where all plants species and their percent cover were listed within 1m2, and environmental variables - such as stones percent cover, slope - were measured within 100m2. To focus on the grazer effects, we used a subsample of plots with similar environmental variables. To study the grazing system - management choices - effects, we ran the analyses using all the plots. At both scales, our results show that species richness, evenness and heterogeneity are significantly higher with wild horses than with sheep grazing. Intermediate value is measured for evenness concerning domestic horses at the grazing system scale. Species richness is significantly higher for domestic horses than sheep focusing on the grazer; intermediate values are measured for evenness and heterogeneity. At both scales, wild horses also favour dicots rather than monocots. Our results indicate that grazing by horses maintains and promotes grassland diversity, especially when horses are managed 'as wild' - allowing them to express their natural behaviour. However, further studies are needed focusing on populations of patrimonial plant species over time, other taxonomical groups and/or on functional diversity and ecosystem services to compare and test more finely the effects of an animal bred extensively and 'as wild'.

AB  - Grassy ecosystems cover >25% of the world's land surface area. The abundance of herbaceous vegetation in these systems directly impacts a variety of ecological processes, including carbon sequestration, regulation of water and nutrient cycling, and support of grazing wildlife and livestock. Efforts to quantify herbaceous biomass, however, are often limited by a trade-off between accuracy and spatial scale. Here, we describe a method for using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to estimate continuous aboveground biomass (AGB) at sub-meter resolutions over large (10-10 000 ha) spatial scales. Across two African savanna ecosystems, we compared field- and LiDAR-derived structural metrics-including measures of vegetation height and volume-with destructively harvested AGB by aligning our geospatial data with the location of harvested quadrats. Using this combination of approaches, we develop scaling equations to estimate spatially continuous herbaceous AGB over large areas. We demonstrate the utility of this method using a long-term, large herbivore exclosure experiment as a case study and comprehensively compare common field- and LiDAR-derived metrics for estimating herbaceous AGB. Our results indicate that UAV-borne LiDAR provides comparable accuracy to standard field methods but over considerably larger areas. Nearly every measure of vegetation structure we quantified using LiDAR provided estimates of AGB that were comparable in accuracy (R-2 > 0.6) to the suite of common field methods we evaluated. However, marked differences between our two sites indicate that, for applications where accurate estimation of absolute biomass is a priority, site-specific parameterization with destructive harvesting is necessary regardless of methodology. With the increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing data globally, our results indicate that many measures of herbaceous vegetation structure can be used to accurately compare AGB, even in the absence of complementary field data.

AB  - Endangered species, despite often living at low population densities, may undergo unexpected density-dependent feedbacks in the case of successful recovery or marked reduction in range. Because density-dependence dynamics can increase risk of extinction, these effects can hamper conservation efforts. In this study, we analyze the dynamics of the largest population of the tamaraw Bubalus mindorensis, a critically endangered ungulate species endemic to Mindoro island, Philippines. The population is located within a <3000 ha area in Mounts Iglit-Baco Natural Park, with limited expansion possibilities. We took advantage of a 22 year time series of tamaraw counts to estimate annual population growth rate and possible density-dependence, accounting for sampling errors in the counts. The tamaraw population has been increasing at an average rate of +5% per year, as would be expected given its protected status by law. Population growth showed strong spatial structuring, with a population growth close to +10% in the core area of protection, and a reduction of abundance of -5% at the periphery of its range, inside the protected area. This range constriction is concerning because our best population dynamics model suggests significant negative density-dependence (Bayes factor = 0.9). The contraction of tamaraw range is likely caused by anthropogenic pressures forcing the species to live at relatively high densities in the core zone where protection is most effective, creating source-sink dynamics. Our study highlights the fact that, despite the continuous population growth over the last two decades, the long-term viability of the Mounts Iglit-Baco Natural Park tamaraw population remains uncertain.

AB  - Rapid climate warming has contributed to significant changes in Arctic and boreal vegetation over the past half century. Changes in vegetation can impact wildlife by altering habitat and forage availability, which can affect behavior and range use. However, animals can also influence vegetation through foraging and trampling and therefore play an important role in determining ecosystem responses to climate change. As wildlife populations grow, density-dependent processes can prompt range expansion or shifts. One mechanism for this is density-dependent forage reduction, which can contribute to nutritional stress and population declines, and can also alter vegetation change trajectories. We assessed the range characteristics of a migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus) herd in east-central Alaska and west-central Yukon Territory as it grew (1992-2017) then declined (2017-2020). Furthermore, we analyzed the correlation between caribou relative spatial density and vegetation change over this period using remotely sensed models of plant functional type cover. Over this period, caribou population density increased in all seasonal ranges. This was most acute in the calving range where density increased 8-fold, from 1.5 to 12.0 animals km-2. Concurrent with increasing density, we documented range shifts and expansion across summer, post-calving and winter ranges. In particular, summer range size doubled (12,000 km2 increase) and overlap with core range (areas with repeated year-round use) was halved. Meanwhile, lichen cover, a key forage item, declined more in areas with high caribou density (2.4% absolute, 22% relative decline in cover) compared to areas where caribou were mostly absent (0.3% absolute, 1.9% relative decline). Conversely, deciduous shrub cover increased more in high caribou density areas. However, increases were dominated by less palatable shrubs whereas more palatable shrubs (i.e., willow [Salix spp.]) were stable or declined slightly. These changes in vegetation cover were small relative to uncertainty in the map products used to calculate change. Nonetheless, correlations between vegetation change and caribou range characteristics, along with concerning demographic trends reported over this same period, suggest changing forage conditions may have played a role in the herd's subsequent population decline. Our research highlights the potential of remotely sensed metrics of vegetation change for assessing the impacts of herbivory and trampling and stresses the importance of in situ data such as exclosures for validating such findings.

AB  - The increasing deer population has significantly altered the forest ecosystems. Deer browsing affects not only plant species diversity and composition but also other organisms indirectly, along with soil properties. However, the effects of deer grazing on the soil microbial community and the underlying mechanisms have not been well understood. To assess these effects, we compared the understory environment and soil microbial community inside and outside fences at Mt. Shiraga, where severe soil environmental degradation has occurred due to sika deer grazing. We selected 20 Fagus trees inhabiting areas within and outside the fences with similar topological features. Eleven environmental variables and both soil prokaryotic and fungal communities were compared between samples inside and outside the fences. The area inside the fence had significantly higher dwarf bamboo density and soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content, whereas soils outside the fences had higher pH and bulk density. The diversity index of the fungal community, in terms of the number of amplicon sequence variants, inside the fence was higher than that outside, whereas that of the prokaryotic community did not differ between fences. Both prokaryotic and fungal communities differed between inside and outside fences. The prokaryotic community changed with the soil C/N ratio, and the relative abundance of oligotrophic bacteria increased with decreasing soil C/N ratio. The fungal community also changed with soil pH and dwarf bamboo density, with the relative abundances of symbiotrophic fungi and ectomycorrhizae increasing with increasing soil pH. Comparative analyses between inside and outside fence samples might provide information on soil microbial community changes with the changes in soil properties after deer grazing.

AB  - The upland and mountainous regions of northern Europe provide a wide variety of ecosystem services. However, these ecosystem services are highly vulnerable to environmental and land-use change. To ensure their future conservation, it is therefore, essential to understand whether upland plant communities will respond positively or negatively to a range of environmental factors such as grazing pressure and landscape-scale factors such as changes in atmospheric SO2 and NOx deposition. To understand this, here, we describe the long-term trends in four UK upland communities (high-level grassland, intermediate grassland, blanket bog, high-level bog) using four replicated long-term experiments examining the effects of sheep grazing compared to no-sheep grazing in Moor House (from 1954 to 2016). Our results showed that species richness and abundance recovered in grazed plots after 2000, with improvements in species richness and abundance of vascular plants, mosses, and liverworts. Unfortunately, no improvement was found for lichens. Species richness, vascular plants, and mosses recovered the fastest, and much faster than liverworts. There was no evidence of slower recovery of species richness and abundance in plots where sheep grazing was removed. These results are consistent with longitudinal studies suggesting recovery after 2000 as a result of reduced atmospheric deposition. Although trends in diversity and abundance in the grazed and ungrazed plots were not identical, they were not markedly different either. The similar richness and abundance trends in the grazed and ungrazed plots found in each plant community suggest that within-community dynamics may overcome initial differences between the grazing treatments over time. In contrast, differences in richness and abundance among plant communities over time suggest that some landscape-scale trends, such as those caused by a reduction in nutrient inputs, initiate community-dependent recovery.

AB  - The removal and exclusion of non-native ungulates for conservation of biodiversity is common globally, including on tropical Pacific Islands. However, the poorly quantified effects of ungulate exclusion on fuels and wildfire may represent an important conservation trade-off. We measured fuels (live and dead fuel loads, type, height and continuity) and modelled potential wildfire behaviour (flame height and rate of spread) inside and outside of 13 ungulate exclosures, three of which received active ecological restoration (e.g. planting of native shrubs and trees), across a 2,740 mm mean annual rainfall (MAR) gradient on the Island of Hawaii. Differences in fuel characteristics and modelled wildfire behaviour inside versus outside of ungulate exclosures were assessed using linear mixed effects analyses. Non-native ungulate removal, in general, increased fine fuel loading (average change ranged from -0.7 to 11.3 Mg/ha), shrub fuel loading (-0.1 to 5.6 Mg/ha) and modelled flame lengths (-0.2 to 1.9 m). Post-removal fine fuel loading and modelled flame lengths increased linearly and positively with moisture availability, by as much as 56% in the wettest sites. Dead fine fuels, a key driver of fire intensity and combustion rates, also increased with ungulate removal. Sites undergoing active ecological restoration exhibited reductions in fuel loading, with greater reductions over time since ungulate removal; by the 10th year following ungulate removal, fine fuel loading was reduced at restoration sites by 41%. Synthesis and applications. Dry and mesic environments where wildfire occurrence is more frequent are of particular concern following non-native ungulate removal, but with drought even typically wet environments can be at high risk of wildfire following ungulate removal. Given limited resources, managers in mesic and wet forests might focus first non-native ungulates in non-native grass-dominated areas that contribute disproportionately to wildfire spread and are adjacent to fenced higher value areas, while managers in dry to mesic areas might focus on removing non-native ungulates. Where possible, land managers in all situations should invest in long-term fuel management strategies such as active ecological restoration to reduce fuel loads and the occurrence and intensity of wildfires.

AB  - Large herbivores are keystone species, so changes in their population abundance can have cascading effects on ecosystems. Over the last decades, many species of deer (Cervidae) have experienced unprecedented densities across many areas of the Northern Hemisphere, potentially leading to simplification of plant-pollinator communities, disruption of their interactions, and destabilization of ecological networks. Our study explores the impacts of increasing red deer (Cervus elaphus) densities on plant-pollinator networks.<br /> We describe, to our knowledge, the first large wild herbivore manipulative experiment with increasing densities, consisting of comparable hectare-scale enclosures in a Mediterranean ecosystem. We simulated two current scenarios of deer overabundance: high densities (>30 individuals km(-2)) and hyper densities (>90 individuals km(-2)). We compared these scenarios to an adjacent control exclosure (no deer). Deer herbivory reduced flower abundance of shrubs, as well as flowering plant and pollinator richness. Remaining plants and pollinators lost interactions, and some plants lost pollinator visitors. Network specialization and modularity decreased because modules (groups of strongly connected species) formed by herbs and specialist pollinators were gradually extirpated as deer density increased. This simplification increased network connectance and nestedness. Network robustness (a measure of stability) remained unaltered because the dominant plant, which attracted most pollinators, was unpalatable to deer.<br /> We conclude that, in overabundant deer scenarios: (1) impacts on plant-pollinator networks will increase with increasing deer density; (2) plant-pollinator networks will be eroded, especially if composed of palatable, rare plants, visited by specialist pollinators; but (3) plant-pollinator network stability will not be affected if dominant plants are generalists and unpalatable.

AB  - Wetlands provide vital services on which human societies depend. As they have been rapidly degrading due to anthropogenic impacts worldwide, wetland restoration is increasingly applied. When a return to the original state of a wetland is constrained, forward-looking restoration can provide a new way to enhance an ecosystem's ecological integrity. However, the direction in which new ecosystems will develop is strongly coupled to the initial environmental conditions and may benefit from active decisions on (future) management. To improve the natural values of a degrading freshwater lake in the Netherlands, a forward-looking restoration project was initiated in lake Markermeer in 2016, involving the construction of a 700-ha archipelago called the "Marker Wadden". This archipelago should provide new habitat to higher trophic levels in the lake's food web through the development of currently missing Common reed (Phragmites australis) dominated marshlands with gradual land-water transitions. However, the restoration project faces strong grazing pressure by Greylag geese (Anser anser) that possibly inhibit reed establishment. Here, we aimed to unravel the effect of herbivory by Greylag geese (using exclosures) and the introduction of reed rhizomes on early vegetation development and carbon dynamics on the bare soils of this new ecosystem in a manipulative field experiment. Our results showed that excluding herbivores strongly increased reed-vegetation cover, density and maximum height, but only when reed rhizomes were actively introduced. Spontaneous vegetation development on bare soils was limited, and colonization by Broadleaf cattail (Typha latifolia) dominated over reed. Net ecosystem exchange of carbon and ecosystem respiration were strongly linked to vegetation development, with highest methane emissions in the most densely vegetated plots. We conclude that the establishment of reed marshes can strongly benefit from excluding herbivores and the introduction of reed, and that otherwise other vegetation types may establish more slowly in newly created wetlands. This illustrates how active management of vegetation development has the potential to benefit novel ecosystems.

AB  - Windstorms are natural factors in vegetation dynamics, but their intensity is increasing and undermines the forest resilience. Post-event interventions depend on forest types and management purposes. To promote mixed stands that are less susceptible to windthrow than monocultures, natural tree regeneration is usually recommended. However, wild ungulates attracted by the increased food supply in the new clearings can influence the secondary succession and slow down vegetation recovery. The impact of ungulate pressure on secondary successions in blowdown areas is still poorly known, especially in Mediterranean areas, which is particularly vulnerable to climate stressors. We investigated this topic using a monospecific silver fir (Abies alba) forest of artificial origin in the Apennines as a model system. The forest was left to natural succession after a severe windthrow in 2015, offering the opportunity to establish an ungulate exclosure experiment to analyse vegetation changes over six years. For the whole plant community, cover and height, alpha-diversity (species richness, Shannon and evenness indexes), and species composition were recorded yearly, together with tree seedling density, in open and fenced plots at increasing distances from the forest edge. Ecological and functional traits (proportion of light-demanding and forest specialists, endo-/epi-zoochorous species), and life-forms of the community samples were also analysed. Overall, we found that ungulates significantly influenced the dynamic trajectories of secondary succession. The effects on plant cover and diversity were negative and increased with distance from the forest edge. The presence of ungulates favoured generalist species and endozoochorous taxa. However, distance from the forest edge strongly reduced the latter effect. The average density of tree seedlings was overall high (ca. 10,000/ha), but it was strongly reduced by ungulates for three deciduous species and A. alba, the most browsed species. Natural recolonization after windthrow in Apennine pure silver fir stands may favour the formation of mixed, less susceptible forests, but the current ungulate pressure slows down this process, especially in the areas furthest from the forest edge.

AB  - Aboveground ecosystem structure moderates and even confers essential ecosystem functions. This includes an ecosystem's carbon dynamics, which are strongly influenced by its structure: for example, tropical savannas like those in central Kenya store substantial amounts of carbon in soil. Savannas' belowground allocation of carbon makes them important for global carbon sequestration, but difficult to monitor. However, the labile soil carbon pool is responsive to changes in ecosystem structure and is thus a good indicator of overall soil organic carbon dynamics. Kenya's savanna structure is controlled by belowground ecosystem engineers (termites), ambient weather conditions, and the aboveground engineering influences of large-bodied, mammalian consumers. As a result, climate change and biodiversity loss are likely to change savannas' aboveground structure. To predict likely outcomes of these threats on savanna soil carbon, it is critical to explore the relationships between labile soil carbon and ecosystem structure, local climate, and mammalian consumer community composition. In a large-scale, long-term herbivore exclosure experiment in central Kenya, we sampled labile carbon from surface soils at three distinct savanna structural elements: termite mounds, beneath tree canopies, and the grassland matrix. In one sampling year, we measured total extractable organic carbon (TEOC), total extractable nitrogen (TEN), and extractable microbial biomass for each sample. Across three sampling years with varying weather conditions, we measured rate of labile soil carbon mineralization. We quantified areal coverage of each structural element across herbivore community treatments to estimate pool sizes and mineralization dynamics at the plot scale. Concentrations and stocks of soil TEOC, TEN, and microbial biomass were driven by the structural element from which they were sampled (soils collected under tree canopies generally had the highest of each). Large-bodied herbivore community composition interacted variably with concentrations, stocks, and carbon mineralization, resulting in apparently compensatory effects of herbivore treatment and structural element with no net effects of large herbivore community composition on plot-scale labile carbon dynamics. We confirmed engineering of structural heterogeneity by consumers and identified distinct labile carbon dynamics in each structural element. However, carbon and nitrogen were also influenced by consumer community composition, indicating potentially compensatory interacting effects of herbivore treatment and structural element. These results suggest that one pathway by which consumers influence savanna carbon is by altering its structural heterogeneity and thus the heterogeneity of its plot-scale labile carbon.

AB  - Large terrestrial herbivorous mammals (LTH-mammals) influence plant community structure by affecting seedling establishment in mature tropical forests. Many of these LTH-mammals frequent secondary forests, but their effects on seedling establishment in them are understudied, hindering our understanding of how LTH-mammals influence forest regeneration in human-modified landscapes.We tested the hypothesis that the strength of LTH-mammals' effects on seedling establishment depends on landscape protection, forest successional stage and plant species' traits using a manipulative field experiment in six 1-ha sites with varying successional age and landscape protection. In each site, we established 40 seedling plot-pairs, with one plot excluding LTH-mammals and one not, and monitored seedlings of 116 woody species for 26 months.We found significant effects of LTH-mammal exclusion on seedling survival contingent upon the protection of forests at the landscape level and forest stage. After 26 months, survival differences between LTH-mammal exclusion and non-exclusion treatments were greater in protected than unprotected landscapes. Additionally, plant species' traits were related to the LTH-mammals' differential effects, as LTH-mammals reduced the survival of seedlings of larger-seeded species the most. Overall, LTH-mammals' effects translated into significant shifts in community composition as seedling communities inside and outside the exclosures diverged. Moreover, lower density and higher species diversity were found as early as 12 and 18 months outside than inside exclosures.Synthesis and applications. Insight into the interactions between LTH-mammals and seedling communities in forest regeneration can be instrumental in planning effective restoration efforts. We highlight the importance of landscape protection in seedling survival and the role of LTH-mammals in promoting seedling diversity in mature forests but also in secondary successional forests. The findings suggest that conservation efforts and possibly trophic rewilding can be important approaches for preserving diversity and influencing the trajectory of secondary tropical forest succession. However, we also caution that an overabundance of LTH-mammals may adversely impact the pace of forest succession due to their preference for large-seeded species. Therefore, a comprehensive wildlife management plan is indispensable. Additionally, longer term studies on LTH-mammals are necessary to understand the effects of temporal fluctuations that are undetected in short-term studies.

AB  - Our study monitored the changes in elephant numbers, distribution, and ecological impacts over a 50-year period. During this period, the free-ranging intermingled movements of wildlife and traditional subsistence pastoralists across the Amboseli ecosystem were disrupted by a national park, livestock ranches, farms, settlements, and changing lifestyles and economies. Elephants compressed into the national park by poaching and settlement turned woodlands to grassland and shrublands, and swamps into short grazing lawns, causing a reduction of plant and herbivore diversity and resilience to extreme events. The results echo the ecological findings of high-density elephant populations in protected areas across eastern and southern Africa. The impact has led to the view of elephants in parks as being incompatible with biodiversity and to population control measures. In contrast to Amboseli National Park, we found woody vegetation grew and plant diversity fell in areas abandoned by elephants. We therefore used naturalistic and exclosure experiments to determine the density-dependent response of vegetation to elephants. We found plant richness to peak at the park boundary where elephants and livestock jostled spatially, setting up a creative browsing-grazing tension that caused a patchwork of habitats and peak of plant richness. Prehistorical and historical literature reviews lend support to the Amboseli findings that elephants and people, the two dominant keystone species in the savannas, have been intimately entangled and coexisted prior to the global ivory trade and colonialism. The findings point to the need to view specific elephant populations in historical perspective and, as far as possible, create connectivity beyond protected areas to allow mobility on an ecosystem and landscape scale. The Amboseli study underscores the significance of space and mobility in the keystone role of elephants, and community-based conservation as a way to foster coexistence at an ecosystem and landscape scale. Space and mobility also alleviate the ecological disruption of compressed populations, and minimizes population management.

AB  - Restoration of plains bison (Bison bison bison) in the northern Great Plains has been controversial for a variety of reasons, including the public concern that bison will supplant cattle on public rangelands. Riparian zones are among the most biologically rich areas within rangelands, but they are highly sensitive to disturbances such as grazing, leading to the public perception that riparian vegetation communities will be negatively impacted by year-round bison grazing compared with the norm of seasonal cattle grazing. Our objective was to evaluate the vegetation community and soil compaction conditions of areas in the northern Great Plains of Montana, where bison have been restored 5 -10 yr as year-round grazers, compared with adjacent sites where cattle have been retained as seasonal grazers. Out of the 24 variables we assessed, only 2 significantly differed between the grazer treatments within our study's time frame and stocking rates. Native species diversity was significantly higher in the bison-grazed treatment (F [1,1,5.98] = 8.16, P = 0.03), and woody height heterogeneity was twice as high in the bison-grazed treatment than the cattle-grazed treatment (F [1,5.97] = 5.81, P = 0.05). Although longer-term studies are required, our findings indicate that year-round bison grazing under the current stocking rates did not degrade riparian vegetation communities compared with seasonal cattle grazing and rather benefitted some aspects of the plant community.

AB  - Herbivory by barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) alters the vegetation cover and reduces ecosystem productivity in high-Arctic peatlands, limiting the carbon sink strength of these ecosystems. Here we investigate how herbivory-induced vegetation changes affect the activities of peat soil microbiota using metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and targeted metabolomics in a comparison of fenced exclosures and nearby grazed sites. Our results show that a different vegetation with a high proportion of vascular plants developed due to reduced herbivory, resulting in a larger and more diverse input of polysaccharides to the soil at exclosed study sites. This coincided with higher sugar and amino acid concentrations in the soil at this site as well as the establishment of a more abundant and active microbiota, including saprotrophic fungi with broad substrate ranges, like Helotiales (Ascomycota) and Agaricales (Basidiomycota). A detailed description of fungal transcriptional profiles revealed higher gene expression for cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, lignin and chitin degradation at herbivory-exclosed sites. Furthermore, we observed an increase in the number of genes and transcripts for predatory eukaryotes such as Entomobryomorpha (Arthropoda). We conclude that in the absence of herbivory, the development of a vascular vegetation alters the soil polysaccharide composition and supports larger and more active populations of fungi and predatory eukaryotes.

AB  - Mountainous grasslands in South America, characterized by their high diversity, provide a wide range of contributions to people, including water regulation, soil erosion prevention, livestock feed provision, and preservation of cultural heritage. Prior research has highlighted the significant role of grazing in shaping the diversity and productivity of grassland ecosystems, especially in highly productive, eutrophic systems. In such environments, grazing has been demonstrated to restore grassland plant diversity by reducing primary productivity. However, it remains unclear whether these findings are applicable to South American mountainous grasslands, where plants are adapted to different environmental conditions. To address this uncertainty, we conducted a meta-analysis of experiments excluding livestock grazing to assess its impact on plant diversity and productivity across mountainous grasslands in South America. In alignment with studies in temperate grasslands, our findings indicated that herbivore exclusion resulted in increased aboveground biomass but reduced species richness and Shannon diversity. The effects of grazing exclusion became more pronounced with longer durations of exclusion; nevertheless, they remained resilient to various climatic conditions, including mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature, as well as the evolutionary history of grazing. In contrast to results observed in temperate grasslands, the reduction in species richness due to herbivore exclusion was not associated with increased aboveground biomass. This suggests that the processes governing (sub)tropical grassland plant diversity may differ from those in temperate grasslands. Consequently, further research is necessary to better understand the specific factors influencing plant diversity and productivity in South American montane grasslands and to elucidate the ecological implications of herbivore exclusion in these unique ecosystems.

AB  - Mediterranean landscapes have been shaped by millennia of human activities, but recent land use changes resulted in the loss of open habitats and the introduction of a novel predator, the cattle egret (Bublucus ibis). These processes may specifically affect reptiles, so we investigated their impacts on reptile communities in 272 maquis in Northern Israel. We collected data on climate, land use, land cover, and potential egret predation pressure, and modelled their effects on reptile species abundance, richness, and turnover. Reptile abundance increased in colder, wetter and higher sites whereas species richness peaked in sites with intermediate geoclimatic conditions. Both abundance and richness were positively associated with goat grazing. Reptile species known to be preyed upon by egrets exhibited lower abundance at sites with high egret predation pressure. Total reptile abundance, egret-prey abundance, and reptile richness tended to be higher in sites with intermediate cover of woody vegetation. Species turnover was weakly related to variation in climate and habitat variables. In sum, maquis reptile assemblages are shaped by an interplay of climate, land use, habitat structure, and predation risk. Consequently, climate warming may lead to abundance declines in drier sites and some reptile habitats are deteriorating in the absence of goat grazing. Alarmingly, a novel threat manifested by the expansion of cattle egrets can have adverse effects on the abundance of egret-sensitive species. Collectively, these processes highlight reptile communities as an emerging conservation concern in maquis ecosystems exposed to land use and climate change, specifically where cattle egrets are prevalent.

AB  - Throughout eastern North America, chronic white-tailed deer overbrowsing and widespread exotic plant invasions degrade native plant diversity and abundance. However, because deer densities are high across entire regions, it is challenging to find large areas where deer have been at low density for long periods. We predicted native plant diversity and abundance would be significantly higher during gap-phase regeneration where deer have been maintained at low densities (similar to 7 deer/km(2)) compared to where deer have been chronically overabundant. Simultaneously, we predicted that exotic plant diversity and abundance would be lower in gaps where deer have been maintained at low versus high densities. We also evaluated whether deer density interacts with gap age, gap size, and gaps in dry versus more mesic forest patches. We studied 41 gaps throughout an 88 km(2) fenced military post where deer were maintained near pre-European-settlement densities for 67 years and in nearby forests where deer have been overabundant for decades. Native species richness, diversity, and cover were 37-65% higher, and exotic species cover was 80% lower in canopy gaps at low relative to high deer density. Stem height and density of multiple native canopy tree species (e.g., two Quercus spp.) were 5-20-fold higher within canopy gaps at low deer density. Moreover, 10 native woody species were indicators of low deer density, including three Quercus species, whereas no native woody species were indicators of high deer density. Deer were the primary filter underlying these different patterns in diversity, abundance, and plant height. Our findings demonstrate that gaps develop a vigorous and diverse native sapling layer, with far fewer exotics, in areas of low deer density without a history of chronic overbrowsing. We propose that military posts may be conservation and native plant regeneration hotspots wherever they regularly cull deer.

AB  - Moose (Alces alces) is a large herbivore that can mediate boreal forest regeneration after timber harvest through selective browsing of tree species. Despite increasing evidence of moose browsing influence on tree growth in early successional forests, climate effects due to changes in carbon sequestration rates and biophysical factors such as albedo remain largely unexplored. We used 11 years of data from 44 pair-sites of herbivore exclosures within clear-cut forests in Norway to investigate how moose browsing alters aboveground tree biomass and albedo. We find a higher total aboveground tree biomass (mainly deciduous species) in unbrowsed than browsed forest plots, as moose browsing limited the growth of tree biomass. The effect of moose exclosure on relative tree abundances differed between sites, suggesting that moose browsing has stronger effects on forest structure than composition. At the same time, moose increased forest albedo relative to un-browsed forests, driving biophysical cooling. When averaged at regional levels, climate effects due to changes in biomass and albedo are of similar magnitude, but contributions can diverge in specific locations. In a region with intensive forestry operations and high moose density, CO2 emissions from moose browsing in post-harvested sites can be equal to about 40% of the annual emissions of fossil fuels from that region. Cooling effects from increased albedo can offset about two thirds of this impact. Given its influence on tree growth rates and climate impacts, management of moose browsing density should be integrated into forest management plans to optimize climate change mitigation and forest productivity.

AB  - Livestock interactions with wildlife have been a concern for managers historically. Invasive feral swine represent an additional management concern in the realm of resource competition as well as zoonotic disease spread between livestock and wildlife. Our study deployed game cameras on a ranch in the Rolling Plains of North Texas to obtain a better understanding of the possibility of interspecies interactions among cattle, feral swine, and white-tailed deer across spatial, temporal, and seasonal variables. Species' use of bottomlands, shallow uplands, and deep uplands within the ranch were monitored continuously over the course of a year. Cattle and feral swine exhibited high diel activity overlap with the greatest overlap estimates occurring in bottomlands (Delta = 0.889) and wintertime (Delta = 0.875). Cattle and deer exhibited lower diel overlap (Delta = 0.596-0.836, depending on the season and vegetation type), which could be a sign of niche partitioning between the two ungulates. Image captures and overlap estimates suggest interactions between cattle and the other two species occur less frequently in shallow upland sites relative to the other vegetation types. Though image captures of the three species were 17-69% lower in summer relative to fall, indirect interactions may remain high due to competition for shared resources and greater reliance on watering sites. Results suggest that land managers should focus on bottomland sites for feral swine eradication efforts and as areas of increased contact among species. Results can be used to guide livestock and wildlife management and herd health decisions, which can improve ranch economic, environmental, and social sustainability.

AB  - Alteration of local biodiversity by climate change may be especially impactful in the Arctic, where species richness is characteristically low and environmental conditions are changing rapidly. Two species of arctic large herbivores that survived rapid warming during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, caribou and muskoxen, again face accelerated warming and changes in vegetation seasonality under contemporary climate change. While numerous studies have investigated the roles of weather and primary productivity in population dynamics of these species, opportunities for investigation of their dynamics in sympatric populations have been limited. We analyzed the population dynamics and offspring production of sympatric caribou and muskoxen at a study site in West Greenland over an 18-year period (2002-2019) during which the timing of spring green-up has advanced rapidly. In caribou, population growth rate and calf production were greater following warm winters but lower in years with earlier spring green-up. While calf production was highly variable, caribou abundance declined over the course of the study. In contrast, muskox population growth and calf production both increased following earlier springs. Moreover, muskox abundance increased over the course of the study, despite a negative association between their rate of increase and winter temperature, perhaps indicating that winter weather was less important than spring green-up timing in their dynamics. Hence, sympatric populations of these two herbivores displayed opposing demographic responses to winter weather and spring plant phenology at this shared location. These results emphasize the complexity of predicting large herbivore responses to climate change, and highlight the potential for impacts to species richness of large herbivore communities as the Arctic continues to warm.

AB  - Shifts in animal husbandry and landscape use have significantly changed ungulate grazing effects on ecosystem functioning. These changes are now the subject of extensive research with respect to plant and soil communities, but the results of these studies are highly varied and context dependent. The objective of this study is to address contextual variation by holding all sampling methods and analytical approaches constant and analyse the effect of the feral goat (Capra hircus) population of Mallorca Island, Spain, on soil physical, chemical and biological characteristics across five controlled sites. Specifically, vegetation cover and soil properties in fenced plots excluded from ungulates were compared with adjacent grazed plots in five independent mountain areas of Mallorca. Soil microbial activity measured as Community-Level Physiological Profiles (CLPP) using EcoPlate (TM) increased when ungulates were excluded. However, all other physical and chemical measures of the soils did not vary significantly when we considered ungulate exclusion across all plots, and this may be caused by a soil community that is simply robust to the effects of the herbivores. Or, it may be due to the high heterogeneity that was detected among pair plots comparisons within each of the five sites. Indeed, we find more variability within a site than among our independent sites leading us to hypothesize that grazing does influence biogeochemical cycles, but it does it by increasing variability of the system in general. Our well-controlled multilevel meta analysis confirms the notion that ungulate effects are highly context dependent, and soil heterogeneity makes resolving clear patterns very challenging. Apparently, context persistently drives the soil response more than the grazing itself, and this is seen even at very small scales.

AB  - Ungulate browsing has been studied for several decades in the northern hemisphere. However, studies have mainly focused on just one or two ungulate species, while rarely contrasting the relative effects of summer and winter browsing. This limits our understanding of the dynamics and effects of browsing in landscapes where ungulate species diversity is increasing. We conducted a seasonal exclosure experiment on former clear-cuts in a multi-species ungulate system in Sweden, to investigate the relative impacts of summer and winter browsing on the conifers Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) at the tree species level. We tested for differences in individual conifer growth and demographic responses between Summer browsing, Winter browsing, No browsing, and Control treatment plots over a 4.5 year experimental period. We defined the demographic response as the distribution of conifers among different height classes. Individual growth rates and demographic responses of both conifer species were similar in the plots with No browsing (year-round exclosures) as in the Control plots with year-round browsing. Plots subject to Summer and Winter browsing differed in terms of their demographic response relative to plots with No browsing and Control plots; more stems reached taller height classes in the Summer and Winter browsing plots with slight differences between the conifer species. We discuss the different responses of Scots pine and Norway spruce considering their differences in palatability and their ability to tolerate plant-plant competition in a multi-species ungulate system, in light of potential associational effects. If fencing is intended to be used as a management practice to mitigate the impacts of deer browsing on conifer growth, our results suggest that a total exclusion of deer does not necessarily enhance conifer growth during the first years of regeneration.

AB  - Aim: Evaluate the temporal changes in species diversity, composition, and structure of ephemeral plant communities and the seed bank in response to long-term herbivore exclusion over 11 years in plots with and without herbivores.LocationNorth-central Chile.Methods: We obtained information on ephemeral vegetation cover in August and September using the intercept point method and recorded seed abundance in April. The Bosque Fray Jorge National Park Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research (LTSER) provided these records covering 11 years (2009-2019). From the original experiment of 20 plots, we used eight plots divided into two treatments: four plots allowed free access to all herbivores (with herbivores), while the other four plots excluded herbivores (without herbivores).Results: We found that Hill-Shannon diversity increased in plant communities with herbivores and a temporal increase in the cover of the dominant species, Plantago hispidula, under herbivore exclusion. In wet years, species richness and temporal turnover of plant communities increased independently of treatment. Although seed abundance differed among treatments and years, population structure remained constant over time and among treatments, suggesting that the seed bank acts as a buffer against shocks that modify plant community dynamics. Structural equation modeling revealed that precipitation, via its positive effects on Plantago hispidula, increases native plant richness to a greater extent than herbivores. However, in the absence of herbivores, precipitation directly affects native species richness. Moreover, we found that precipitation also influences the native species richness of the seed bank, both directly and indirectly, although its impacts exhibit a time lag.Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that the temporal dynamics of ephemeral plant communities and seed banks in semi-arid ecosystems are strongly coupled to climate variability, highlighting the vulnerability of these communities to biodiversity loss and climate change.

AB  - QuestionLivestock grazing affects plant communities in drylands worldwide. However, our current understanding of the Patagonian drylands has primarily been derived from comparing exclosures with grazing conditions or from single-site grazing gradients. The pending question is: do impacts of grazing intensification on Patagonian plant communities change along aridity gradients?LocationPatagonia, Argentina.MethodsWe surveyed vegetation cover of perennial species in paddocks with different sheep-grazing pressure (ungrazed, lightly, moderately, and intensively grazed, based on long-term stocking rates), in three plant communities located along a regional aridity gradient: a semi-desert (arid), a shrub-grass steppe (semi-arid), and a grass steppe (dry sub-humid). In these communities, we analyzed the effects of grazing pressure on the total cover of vegetation, the cover of dominant plant life-forms (grasses and shrubs), the plant species diversity, and the traits of dominant plant species.ResultsIntensification of sheep grazing significantly decreased total vegetation cover in the semi-desert, but not in the steppes. Although grazing decreased the cover of grasses (particularly of the highly preferred ones) in all communities, in the shrub-grass and grass steppes this reduction was offset by an increase in the cover and size of shrubs. Plant diversity was not consistently affected by grazing pressure in these communities. Traits of dominant plant species partially explained community responses to grazing intensification.ConclusionsLivestock grazing intensification reduces the forage quantity and quality of Patagonian plant communities, but the severity depends on plant community types. In semi-deserts (the most arid), grasses were drastically affected, while in the steppes, the grazing effects on grasses were low and partially compensated by an increase in the cover and size of shrubs, which fulfill critical roles other than forage provision. It is fundamental that grazing pressure be adapted to forage resource availability for each community type to achieve sustainable management in the context of climate change.
   We studied the impacts of intensifying livestock grazing on Patagonian plant communities across an aridity gradient. Grazing intensification reduced both the quantity and quality of forage within all plant communities, but the severity of the impacts increased with increasing aridity. Management of grazing pressure should be adapted to each community type to achieve sustainable management in the context of climate change.image

AB  - Tree species richness, forest structure, and seasonal fluctuations between rainy and dry seasons can strongly affect trophic interactions in forest ecosystems, but the inter- and scale dependence of these variables remains unclear. Using artificial caterpillars (similar to 18,000 replicates), we analyzed predation pressure by arthropods, birds, and rodents along a tree species richness gradient across seasons in a subtropical tree diversity experiment (BEF-China). The aim of the study was to test if forest structure, in addition to tree species richness, has an effect on predation pressure and to further specify which structural variables are important in driving predation. We assessed the effects of tree species richness and forest structure at the plot and local neighborhood levels. We also included fine-scale placement covariates, plot size, and topographical covariates of the study site. Forest structure and tree species richness independently and interactively affected predation pressure. The spatial scale was an important determinant for tree species richness and structural effects, extending from within plot scales to the overall heterogeneity of the plots' surrounding environment. For example, the effect of branch density in the local neighborhood depended on both surrounding tree species richness and plot-level vegetation density. Similarly, visibility-enhancing factors increased attacks by arthropods (lack of branches in close surroundings) and by birds (open area), depending on the surrounding vegetation. A comparison of structural measures showed that predation pressure can be addressed in much greater detail with multiple specific structural features than with overall forest complexity. Seasonal change also affected predation pressure, with foliage being a stronger attractant in spring, but also by presumable topography-driven study plot differences in sun exposure and humidity between rainy and dry seasons. Our study demonstrates that predation pressure is not simply a function of tree species richness or structure but is shaped by the interplay of structural elements, spatial scale, and seasonal dynamics along gradients of tree species richness and forest structure. The structural and seasonal effects are important to take into account when addressing how current and future biodiversity loss may change top-down control of herbivory and overall ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Temperate grassland biomes are globally imperiled, and grassland birds are in precipitous decline as a result. The majority of North America's grassland birds breed on rangelands occupied by domestic cattle, but reintroductions of bison to restore evolutionary grazing patterns are increasingly common. Grassland landscapes in western North America have undergone drastic changes since millions of bison occupied this landscape, and the biodiversity effects of bison on modern rangelands remain poorly understood. Here, we test the biodiversity effects of native versus non-native grazers in the context of a highly diverse grassland bird community on the Northern Great Plains of North America. We compared the effects of 2 different grazing treatments common across the region on avian diversity: seasonally grazed and manually rotated domestic cattle, and year-round, free-moving bison. We also test whether estimated abundances of 11 grassland/steppe obligate songbirds differ between these two management regimes. We found roughly equivalent bird diversity, as measured by species richness and Shannon's diversity index, at sites occupied year-round by bison and seasonally by cattle. We also found no significant effect of grazer type on 9 of 11 grassland songbird species. The two exceptions were Grasshopper Sparrow and Vesper Sparrow, which were more abundant in bison pastures. Our results suggest that both native and nonnative grazers can create habitat for a highly diverse assemblage of grassland birds under grazer-specific management regimes.

AB  - Seasonal nomadic pastoralism (SNP), a traditional practice uniquely adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, plays a critical role in alleviating grazing pressure on alpine grassland ecosystems. However, the responses and underlying adaptive mechanisms of dominant plateau ungulates to SNP remain poorly understood. This study investigated the disturbance sensitivity of the Kiang (Equus kiang) and the Tibetan Gazelle (Procapra picticaudata). It further explored their adaptive mechanisms across multiple ecological niche dimensions in the context of SNP in Shiqu County, eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Based on our findings, the Tibetan Gazelle exhibits greater sensitivity to disturbance compared to the Kiang. The herd sizes of both species were significantly and positively correlated with their distance from pastoral tent sites. SNP contributes to substantial habitat degradation and landscape fragmentation for both species. SNP significantly alters the Kiang's activity rhythms, while the Tibetan Gazelle's activity patterns remain relatively stable. In grazed areas, the Kiang exhibited reduced daytime activity and increased evening and nocturnal activity. Both species reduced the proportion of optimal food in their diets, increased their reliance on suboptimal food sources, broadened their dietary niche breadths, and decreased their dietary overlap with Yaks (Poephagus grunniens). This study establishes a critical foundation for understanding the complex interplay between grazing practices and alpine ungulate ecology. It also provides support for the development of sustainable grazing strategies and biodiversity conservation efforts within the fragile alpine grassland ecosystems.

AB  - The islands of the Aegean Sea are areas of high biodiversity and endemism and harbor globally important seabird communities. Resident seabirds breed on offshore islands, where they often form strong nesting colonies. Breeding seabirds are important determinants of an island's ecosystem function while also being exposed to a plethora of human activities. Understanding how anthropogenic activities impact such populations is not just essential for seabird conservation but is also critically important for the management of small insular ecosystems and the native species communities they support. We quantify the effect of human activities on the size and locations of Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis) colonies from the Cyclades and Sporades archipelagos. We gathered data on variables suspected to influence seabird colonies, including physical islet characteristics, resource availability, and type and extent of human disturbance. Analyses were conducted on the local (islet) and on the regional (island cluster) levels to identify proximate and ultimate factors shaping the breeding population sizes of resident colonies. On the local level, we identify a clear negative effect of the presence of invasive rats on gull nesting density. Similarly, the presence of feral grazing mammals such as goats and rabbits has negative impacts on gull populations, an effect that appears to be primarily mediated through nest disturbance. Access to landfills and fishing vessels both had positive impacts on gull nesting density. Our results suggest approaches to managing Yellow-legged Gull populations in the Mediterranean Basin by taking into consideration the roles of introduced mammals, fishing activities, and open-air landfills on seabirds in the region.

AB  - Reducing grass standing crop by grazing may increase forbs and benefit wildlife that depend on forbs. However, precipitation and soil texture also strongly influence forb standing crop. We determined if standing crop of forbs selected by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimm.) is more strongly influenced by grazing or precipitation. Ungulates typically graze in patches with greater standing crop than the surrounding vegetation. Our second objective was to determine if predicted relationships of forb standing crop with grazing, precipitation, and percent sand were similar with less productive sites included or excluded from models. We estimated standing crop of grasses and forbs in 50 paired grazing exclosures and grazed plots on each of six 2 500-ha study sites. Standing crop of forbs selected by white-tailed deer (selected forbs) was strongly related to precipitation and percent sand but not estimated percent use of grasses. For our second objective, we examined grazing effects on forbs by removing pairs of exclosures and grazed plots from the data where grass standing crop in nongrazed exclosures exceeded the average standing crop of grass after grazing. Percent use of grasses did not influence selected forb standing crop when we included only productive patches. For overall forb standing crop in productive patches, percent use of grasses and percent sand interacted. Forbs declined with increasing percent use of grasses in less sandy soils and increased with percent use of grasses in sandy soils. Grazing is not useful to increase forbs selected by white-tailed deer in our study sites because standing crop of selected forbs is more strongly dependent on precipitation and soil texture than on grazing. Grazing did influence forb standing crop in productive areas, which suggests accounting for grazing effects in productive versus less productive areas of the landscape provides insight into herbivore-vegetation relationships.

AB  - Effective fire and grazing management practices are crucial to the restoration of prairie ecosystems, but prairie restoration efforts have only recently included bison (Bison bison) reintroduction. Given the novelty of such efforts and the importance of grazing in ecosystem dynamics, questions remain regarding how human activity and habitat management affect bison habitat selection. We radiocollared seven female bison at an enclosed restored grassland site in northern Illinois during 2014-2016 and developed resource selection models to evaluate the influence of land cover, fire management, and concentrated human activity on habitat selection by bison. To help managers target areas for future activities, we used the most-supported model to map predicted bison use across the study area. Our results indicated that bison habitat selection was primarily driven by the type of restoration conducted at a location, with strong selection for partially restored prairie and avoidance of nongrassland areas. These results are likely due to the expected high relative abundance of perennial grasses at partially restored prairie sites in our study area. Our research emphasizes the relationship between restoration approaches and grazers in prairie ecosystems and underscores the importance of including restoration practices in habitat selection research. Additionally, the map of predicted bison use highlights areas to focus further management and conduct vegetation surveys to ensure grazing is resulting in increased plant diversity and species richness.

AB  - 1. Invasive mammals exert pervasive effects on vegetation communities in island systems through several pathways, including by introducing novel disturbances. In Hawai'i, feral pigs pose a particular threat to endemic species that evolved in the absence of native ungulates. The effects of pig soil disturbance on understory vegetation are contingent on the distribution and density of disturbed patches and subsequent species responses influenced by traits conferring growth and reproductive strategies. However, little is known about how these traits influece native- non-native species turnover in response to pig disturbance, or how such disturbances affect trait-mediated responses to other environmental variables.2. Here we quantify the effects of leaf traits and dispersal attributes on species responses to pig soil disturbance at two spatial scales-0.5 m(2) patches embedded along 20 m transects within sites-across a gradient of pig density in a Hawaiian montane wet forest using Bayesian mixed models.3. Native and non-native species demonstrated divergent responses, with increasing presence and abundance of non-native species in the understory as soil disturbance within patches and sites increased. Dominant patterns in measured traits tracked the leaf economic spectrum (LES), with non-native species tending toward resource-acquisitive traits. Species with resource-acquisitive traits, regardless of identity, were favoured with disturbance and responded positively to light availability in disturbed sites. Models showed species primarily dispersed by wind were more prevalent in disturbed patches and sites than those dispersed by endozoochory, while seed mass had no effect.4. Our results suggest pig activity influences community composition and favours non-native species establishment, and these effects are mediated in part by traits conferring rapid resource acquisition. We also show that the extent of disturbance at the site-scale is relevant for the influence of leaf architecture on understory responses to light availability, demonstrating how the effects of disturbance are scale-dependent and can influence species sorting along independent environmental gradients.

AB  - Top-down control by large herbivores is a well-known driver of plant diversity structure and productivity. Yet, for forest ecosystems the sign and magnitude of herbivore control across resource gradients is not well understood. We conducted a series of replicated large herbivore exclusion experiments in defaunated and non-defaunated Atlantic forests of Brazil to evaluate the effects of large herbivores on tropical plant communities. We hypothesized that the top-down impact of large herbivores on seedling recruitment, species richness, diversity and productivity would change across a natural gradient in the density of a key plant resource, the palm Euterpe edulis, which is thought to act as a foundation species. We found both positive (agonistic) and negative (antagonistic) spatially-structured effects of large herbivores on plant communities driven by an interaction between large herbivores and palm density on non-defaunated sites, but not on defaunated sites. Indeed, through its interaction with large herbivores, palm trees were able to regulate the spatial structure of seedling communities. In the non-defaunated forest, the negative impact of large herbivores on plant recruitment and species richness decreased substantially as palms became more abundant and canopy cover decreased. Furthermore, large herbivores caused a 185% increase but a 194% decrease in aboveground seedling productivity in areas of high and low palm density, respectively. In contrast, in the defaunated forest we did not find any consistent large herbivore impacts on plant recruitment or species richness across the gradient of palm density, and herbivore activity consistently had negative effects on seedling productivity. Analyses using camera trap data indicate that white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu peccari) played a key role in modulating recruitment and seedling productivity, while tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) contributed significantly to an increase in plant diversity, hence playing a functionally complementary role. Our results demonstrate that a key interaction between large forest-dwelling tropical herbivores and their palm resource results in landscape-scale modulation of plant communities through positive and negative spatially-structured feedbacks, and support the view that palms might act as foundation species in tropical forests. Anthropogenic pressures posed by defaunation and illegal palm harvesting in the Neotropics might lead to the functional loss of this interaction and the collapse of the spatial structure along palm density gradients, with cascading effects on the dynamics and productivity of tropical forests.

AB  - Globally, the conservation value of tropical grasslands, unlike tropical forests, is underappreciated, and their degradation is widespread. Conservation of this vulnerable ecosystem requires scientifically validated management strategies. The present study examines the impact of flooding, herbivory, and other management practices on the riverine grasslands of Brahmaputra floodplains of Assam, India, for devising effective conservation strategies. Inundation period-based unsupervised classification was used to derive the types and extent of grasslands viz., short (SG) and tall (TG). Subsequently, the data on vegetation composition and nutrient status viz., soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), was collected from inside and outside of 15 exclosures that were subjected to different management regimes, including grazing (freely accessed by mega- and meso-herbivores), ungrazed (not accessed by mega- and meso-herbivores), ungrazed with controlled burning and ungrazed with invasive removal. A total of 1152 plots were monitored for two-year, from January 2014 to December 2015. The results of the study revealed that the areas inundated for a longer duration were dominated by SG and had higher species diversity, while areas inundated for the shorter duration were dominated by TG and had low species diversity. We further observed that grazing exclusion promoted heterogeneity, woody and invasive growth, and soil nutrient content. Burning and invasive removal reduced woody and invasive growth and enhanced soil nutrient conditions. Grazing and burning decreased heterogeneity, while invasive removal increased heterogeneity. Alteration of the flooding regime due to reduced water availability may affect the ratio of SG and TG extent in the long run, which may alter the vegetation composition and the productivity of these grasslands. We recommend short-term rotational grazing for SG and long-term for TG to promote heterogeneity and soil quality. Controlled burning can be carried out in dry and invaded areas post uprooting of invasives to mitigate the effect of succession.

AB  - Detection of spatial and temporal changes in vegetation cover are essential for a better understanding of the state and abundance of resources in a region. This study focuses on the evaluation of the changes and the recovery of the vegetation cover of Guadalupe Island, affected by the presence of feral goats, eradicated in 2007. The change analysis was based on the calculation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), using high-resolution multispectral satellite images of the QuickBird and WorldView-2 satellites, from 2004 and 2013, corresponding to the stage before and after the eradication of goats, respectively. The change in the surface and the rate of change in the coverage of the plant communities were evaluated. According to the results obtained, the cypress, pine and palm forest cover were easily identified, with an increase in biomass for 2013. Similarly, it was found that the grassland doubled its surface coverage, and there was a decrease in bare soil for 2013. However, the NDVI had limitations in determining changes in scrub cover due to the low and medium density of vegetation for both years; therefore, the analysis of SAVI coverage was deepened, with better results and a sustained increase in post-eradication values. The changes indicate a recovery for almost all communities by 2013.

AB  - 1. Large grazers modify vegetated ecosystems and are increasingly viewed as keystone species in trophic rewilding schemes. Yet, as their ecosystem influences are context-dependent, a crucial challenge is identifying where grazers sustain, versus undermine, important ecosystem properties and their resilience.
   2. Previous work in diverse European saltmarshes found that, despite changing plant and invertebrate community structure, grazers do not suppress below-ground properties, including soil organic carbon (SOC). We hypothesised that, in contrast, eastern US saltmarshes would be sensitive to large grazers as extensive areas are dominated by a single grass, Spartina alterniflora. We predicted that grazers would reduce above- and below-ground Spartina biomass, suppress invertebrate densities, shift soil texture and ultimately reduce SOC concentration.
   3. We tested our hypotheses using a replicated 51-month large grazer (horse) exclusion experiment in Georgia, coupled with observations of 14 long-term grazed sites, spanning similar to 1000 km of the eastern US coast.
   4. Grazer exclusion quickly led to increased Spartina height, cover and flowering, and increased snail density. Changes in vegetation structure were reflected in modified soil texture (reduced sand, increased clay) and elevated root biomass, yet we found no response of SOC. Large grazer exclusion also reduced drought-associated vegetation die-off.
   5. We also observed vegetation shifts in sites along the eastern US seaboard where grazing has occurred for hundreds of years. Unlike in the exclusion experiment, long-term grazing was associated with reduced SOC. A structural equation model implicated grazing by revealing reduced stem height as a key driver of reduced soil organic carbon.
   6. Synthesis: These results illustrate the context dependency of large grazer impacts on ecosystem properties in coastal wetlands. In contrast to well-studied European marshes, eastern US marshes are dominated and structured by a single foundational grass species resulting in vegetation and soil properties being more sensitive to grazing. Coastal systems characterised by a single foundation species might be inherently vulnerable to large grazers and lack resilience in the face of other disturbances, underlining that frameworks to explain and predict large grazer impacts must account for geographic variation in ecosystem structure.

AB  - As the urgency to mitigate climate change becomes more important, so too does the need for effective policies and management that deliver effective carbon storage and sequestration world-wide. Tidal marshes are one of several 'blue carbon' ecosystems where enhanced management offers natural climate mitigation solutions. However, their capacity to store carbon can be diminished by anthropogenic land use. We measured carbon stocks and rates of decomposition in tropical tidal marshes that have experienced disturbance from ungulates (cattle and feral pigs). We found that tidal marsh carbon stocks were higher near the surface of the sediment relative to estimates from deeper in the soil profile. Generally, both carbon stocks and decomposition rates were higher in areas with greater tidal inundation, apart from a unique location where tidal flow has been severely restricted by a road. Remarkably, the fenced wetland had the lowest surface soil carbon ratio in the surface sediments (30 cm), a response presumably due to the wetland being used by cattle (seasonal grazing) that are more concentrated because they are trapped in the fenced enclosure (not outside the fenced protection area), compared to open wetland areas that also still have grazing impacts, but apparently causing much less impact because of a distributed use regime. Our study outlines that fencing wetlands to hold out ungulates but to then use the restored area for seasonal grazing seems counter-intuitive and a misuse of government funds.

AB  - The population of Soay sheep on the island of Hirta in the Outer Hebrides has been the subject of continuous study for more than 35 years. This paper focuses on the botanical aspects of the plant-herbivore interaction, showing how the vegetation affects and is affected by the sheep. Grazing impacts on biomass and spatial structure varied across plant communities, with Holcus/Agrostis grasslands affected most and Wet Heath least, consistent with the hypothesis that herbivore impacts are proportional to plant productivity. Within plant communities, the negative relationships between sheep numbers and plant abundance (sward height, gap/tussock cover and biomass) were significant in March but not significant in August, as expected if sheep numbers are limited by food supply in winter. In most species, flower stem density declined with increasing sheep numbers. There were no examples where unpalatable plants showed increased flowering (e.g. from competitor release under selective grazing). Plant production in temporary grazing exclosures (above-ground net primary production) was greatest in Holcus/Agrostis grassland (12.6 t ha(-1) dry matter year(-1)), lower in Nardus grassland (5.1 t ha(-1) year(-1)) and least in Plantago sward (1.3 t ha(-1) year(-1)) associated with differences in historical nutrient supply and microclimate. The net effect of grazing on plant species richness was positive: A few highly palatable species were excluded, but small-scale coexistence of grazing-tolerant species was enhanced by defoliation. The Soay sheep population fluctuated from 908 (in 1988) to 2,208 (in 2009), increasing by an average of 39 extra animals per year over the period 1985-2011. Between 2011 and 2020, the population fluctuated less widely and showed no trend. Population change (ln(N(t + 1)/N(t))) was inversely density dependent but positively correlated with plant production in Holcus/Agrostis grassland which increased during the study. This plant-herbivore interaction is highly resilient, and though some species (Festuca rubra and Ranunculus acris) declined in the Holcus/Agrostis grassland, there was no significant upward trend in the abundance of unpalatable plant species. Synthesis. Implications for future studies and analyses of plant-herbivore data. Concentrating on estimating primary productivity and herbivore offtake, rather than simply measuring change in plant biomass, is likely to provide greatly improved explanatory power for understanding herbivore population dynamics.

AB  - Very few multi-species or ecosystem comparisons of post-fire vertebrate herbivore activity and food preference exist to inform fire management and conservation strategies. We inferred post-fire (1-3 years) native and introduced vertebrate herbivore activity and attraction to six diverse temperate vegetation communities (grassland to rainforest) from scat counts. We hypothesised that where fire reduced herbaceous and grassy vegetation ('fodder'), vertebrate herbivores would decline, and that post-fire preferences of native versus exotic herbivores would differ significantly. Instead, we found evidence for a 'fire and fodder reversal phenomenon' whereby native macropod and exotic deer scats were more abundant after fire in consistently 'fodder-poor' vegetation types (e.g., heath) but less abundant after fire in previously fodder-rich vegetation communities (e.g., grassland). Fodder cover predicted native macropod, wombat, and introduced deer activity and bare ground cover was strongly associated with introduced herbivore activity only, with the latter indicating post-fire competition for food sources due to their abundance in high-altitude open ecosystems. We, therefore, found environmental and vegetation predictors for each individual species/group and suggest broadscale multi-environment, multispecies observations to be informative for conservation management in potentially overlapping post-fire niches.

AB  - A loss of trees in many African savannas has raised concerns over the effects of increasing herbivore populations, particularly African elephants (Loxodonta africana), on the persistence of large tree populations. To assess the potential for tree recovery, we used an herbivore exclosure experiment in Kruger National Park, South Africa, to estimate the effects of herbivores on survival, recruitment, and population growth rates for three common savanna tree species. We individually tagged trees and tracked their demography over three years in mega- and large herbivore exclosures, megaherbivore only exclosures, and open control plots. We found that megaherbivores generally limited tree survival and population growth; however, both mega- and large herbivores had varying effects on tree species with different antiherbivore strategies (i.e., resistance versus tolerance), suggesting they have the potential to shift tree species composition. Herbivores did not influence tree recruitment rates, which were low across treatments and species. Therefore, even with a reduction in megaherbivore pressure and subsequent increase in tree survival, tree populations are unlikely to recover quickly unless conditions conducive to their recruitment are met. Management efforts should focus on implementing strategies that will promote tree recruitment in these landscapes.

AB  - Context. In south-eastern Australia, the abundance and distribution of non-native sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) has increased dramatically in alpine environments. As a result, significant concern surrounds the potential for the species to impact rare plant species and vegetation communities through browsing.Aims. We aimed to determine the diversity of the plant species eaten by sambar deer in the Alpine National Park and to understand any spatial and temporal variation in deer diets.Methods. We collected 90 sambar deer faecal pellet samples over a 3-month flowering period across two contrasting study sites with differing elevation, vegetation and underlying geology. We performed DNA sequencing using the ITS2 gene region and assigned dietary items to the lowest taxonomic level possible. The frequency of occurrence and sequencing read depth of each dietary item was calculated to investigate the diet of sambar deer at spatial and temporal scales, and dietary preferencing was assessed by comparing the frequency of occurrence of dietary items to the observation records for each dietary item in the study area.Key results. We detected a total of 369 unique plant Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) from sambar deer faecal samples, representing 35 families and 80 genera. Considerable variation in the diet was observed over small spatial scales, and evidence of temporal diet variation was noted in one of the study sites. We detected Silky Snow-daisy (Celmisia sericophylla), which is currently listed as critically endangered under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988, and Hawkweed (Pilosella spp.), a highly invasive, non-native taxon that is sparingly established in Alpine ecosystems.Conclusions. Sambar deer displayed an intermediate feeder behaviour in alpine environments, foraging on a variety of forbs and shrubs, but forbs were the dominant dietary items. The spatial variation observed in the diet of sambar deer suggests that individual deer are unlikely to be dispersing widely while foraging.Implications. Our results emphasise the need for careful evaluation of sambar deer impacts within individual sites and at small spatial scales. The detection of species of conservation significance in the diet indicates that the presence of sambar deer should be considered a significant risk to biodiversity in areas of high conservation value.

AB  - Fish community manipulation and regulation has been largely overlooked as a mitigation strategy for restoring submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in shallow lakes of the middle and lower Yangtze River Basin (MLYRB). An in-situ fish exclusion experiment and a large-scale lake manipulation were conducted to test the hypothesis that the reasonable removal of benthivorous and herbivorous fish would facilitate the restoration and reconstruction of SAV in shallow lakes within the MLYRB. The in-situ exclusion experiment was conducted from April to October in 2017. Electrofishing was used to remove benthivorous and herbivorous fish from the exclosures. SAV were then artificially planted in the same pattern and density in both exclosures and adjacent open sites, and responses were measured for seven consecutive months. The mean percent coverage and biomass of SAV in the exclosures increased quickly and remained significantly higher than those in open sites over the duration of the experiment. Water quality also improved as turbidity, chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus and total nitrogen in the exclosures remained significantly lower than those in the open sites. After the in-situ experiment, a larger scale manipulation of fish in the entire submerged macrophyte zone (SMZ) was implemented from 2017 to 2020. After removing more than 2/3 of the benthivorous and herbivorous fish biomass by October 2020 in the SMZ, both the species richness and spatial coverage of SAV increased from 2 to 9 and from 1.7% to 32.2%, respectively. Our results provided clear evidence that fish are strong regulators of SAV productivity and that their reasonable removal facilitates ecological recovery. Therefore, we propose that fish community manipulation as implemented in this study be given more attention in addition to the reduction of external nutrient loading when designing projects to restore SAV in shallow lakes of the MLYRB.

AB  - Northern mixed-grass prairies are recognized for their high biodiversity but are becoming increasingly threatened by conversion to agricultural rangeland. To determine how grazing by cattle or reintroduced bison may impact these plant communities, we examined the primary drivers of northern mixed-grass prairie plant communities, assessed the heterogeneity of community composition at two sites with differing land use histories, and identified factors important for heterogeneity in these prairie communities. Overall, community characteristics were similar across sites, but community composition differed markedly across short distances. Both landscape traits, including elevation, slope, and precipitation, and grazing pressure were primary drivers of community composition. While bison-grazed sites had lower grazing pressure, both relative cover and richness of native plant species were higher in cattle-grazed sites. As both sites were historically cattle grazed, our results suggest that management legacies play a large role in northern mixed-grass prairie community composition and the benefits of bison grazing may only become apparent after a substantial amount of time since reintroduction.

AB  - Since ecological systems often experience multiple disturbances, understanding changes in important ecological interactions, such as plant-herbivore interactions, may require studies capable of disentangling the unique and interactive effects of multiple forms of disturbance. For example, understanding how mammalian herbivores affect plant communities may require understanding how widespread past disturbances, such as agricultural land use, interact with contemporary disturbances, such as prescribed fire. We tested if past agricultural land use and contemporary fire regime modified the effects of mammalian herbivory on focal plant communities by measuring the richness of plant species preferred by deer at 26 longleaf pine woodlands containing paired open and largemammal exclusion plots. Land-use history significantly affected the community composition of deer-preferred species, and focal species were 8.19 times more likely to be present in post-agricultural sites than nonagricultural sites. Large-mammal herbivory only affected plant species richness in woodlands with low fire frequencies wherein focal species were on average 2.23 times more likely to be present in exclusion plots than open plots. These results suggest that past and present disturbances can mediate contemporary plant-animal interactions and may explain spatial patterns in the intensity of large-mammal herbivory. Our findings also suggest that common management practices, such as use of prescribed burns, may indirectly promote plant species richness by reducing deer herbivory.

AB  - Irruption of herbivore populations due to the extirpation of predators has led to dramatic changes in ecosystem functioning worldwide. Herbivores compete with other species for their primary source of nutrition, plant biomass. Such competition is typically considered to occur between species in closely related clades and functional groups but could also occur with detritivores that consume senescent plant biomass. In this study, we tested predictions that in ecosystems where herbivores are not regulated by predators, their indirect impacts on dead vegetation increase with primary productivity and extend to termites that feed on senescent vegetation. We compared dead vegetation cover and termite activity in herbivore exclosures and associated grazed plots at three locations situated along a rainfall gradient in arid Australia where kangaroo populations have irrupted. Dead vegetation cover and termite activity increased with rainfall in ungrazed plots but showed a negligible response to rainfall in grazed plots. Our results suggest that grazing can disrupt the flow of energy to detritivores and decouple the relationship between termite activity and primary productivity. Such disruption could have far-reaching impacts on arid ecosystems because many organisms sit within "brown food webs" that are sustained by energy derived from the decomposition of senescent plant tissues.

AB  - Fire refugia and patchiness are important to the persistence of fire-sensitive species and may facilitate biodiversity conservation in fire-dependent landscapes. Playing the role of ecosystem engineers, large herbivores alter vegetation structure and can reduce wildfire risk. However, herbivore effects on the spatial variability of fire and the persistence of fire-sensitive species are not clear. To examine the hypothesis that large herbivores support the persistence of fire-sensitive species through the creation of fire refugia in fire-prone landscapes, we examined the response of a fire-sensitive plant, Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis [Beetle & Young]) to fire and grazing in the fire-dependent mixed-grass prairie of the northern Great Plains. We carried out a controlled burn in 2010 within pre-established exclosures that allowed differential access to wild and domestic herbivores and no record of fire in the previous 75 years due to fire suppression efforts. The experiment was set up with a split-plot design to also examine potential changes in plots that were not burned. Canopy cover of big sagebrush was recorded before the burn in 2010 and again in 2011 with percent area burned recorded within 1-month post-fire in the burned plots. Percentage area burned was the greatest in ungulate exclosures (92% +/- 2%) and the least in open areas (55% +/- 21%), suggesting that large herbivores influenced fire behavior (e.g., reducing fire intensity and rate of spread) and are likely to increase fire patchiness through their alterations to the fuel bed. Regression analysis indicated that the proportion of sagebrush cover lost was significantly correlated with the proportion of area burned (R-2 = 0.76, p = 0.05). No differences in the non-burn plots were observed among grazing treatments or among years. Altogether, this illustrates the potential importance of large herbivores in creating biotic-driven fire refugia for fire-sensitive species to survive within the flammable fuel matrix of fire-dependent grassland ecosystems such as the mixed-grass prairie. Our findings also attest to the resiliency of the northern Great Plains to fire and herbivory and underscore the value of managing grasslands for heterogeneity with spatial and temporal variations in these historic disturbances.

AB  - The simultaneous agricultural conversion of North American prairies and removal of native megagrazers-primarily bison (Bison bison)-has limited our understanding of how bison impact prairie plant communities. Further obscuring the role of native megagrazers is that, in what little prairie remains, either grazers are absent or domestic cattle are dominant. We used a three-decade experiment to assess how fire frequency and reintroducing bison affected upland tallgrass prairie plant communities and their phylogenetic diversity (PD). Grazing and fire shifted plant communities significantly over time. The ungrazed treatment was a largely static community dominated by four grass species, with occasional forbs and subshrubs. In contrast, community composition in the bison treatment shifted dramatically, with increasing abundance of native forbs, subdominant grasses, and small annual plant species. Compared to ungrazed areas, bison treatments had 225 % more unique species, 125 % more unique plant families, and higher richness within common plant families such as Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Poaceae. Cattle-grazed communities fell between these two treatments with higher abundance and richness of Carex spp. Most treatments had similar, unchanging PD values over time, except annually burned, ungrazed prairie, where PD steadily declined. All treatments were resistant and/or resilient to an extreme drought in 2011 and 2012, with no lasting changes in composition or PD before, during or after the drought. This resistance to change emphasizes the importance of the core grassland plant species to maintain functional group composition. Grazing and fire drove shifts in tallgrass prairie plant communities, which were resilient to extreme drought.

AB  - The Cyclades Islands (Aegean Sea, Greece) are part of the Mediterranean Basin biodiversity hotspot and harbor a plethora of endemic species. Plant communities on the smaller islands in this region have largely evolved in the absence of herbivory and frequently lack antiherbivore defenses. This study evaluates the short- and long-term effects of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), an herbivore that has been released on numerous islands in the region, by comparing islands that 1. have historically been rabbit-free (ungrazed); 2. are currently grazed by rabbits, and 3. have previously been grazed, but are now rabbit-free. Ecological impacts of rabbits on the Aegean Islands were investigated by assessing the abundance, composition, and diversity of plant and arthropod communities as well as soil characteristics. Our results indicate that ungrazed islands have more arthropod species, more specialized or endemic plant species, and less exposed soil than currently grazed islands. While ungrazed islands did not necessarily possess higher total plant species richness, they did harbor significantly more small-island endemic taxa relative to presently grazed islands. This study indicates that native plant communities on Mediterranean islets are not adapted to the presence of this introduced species and that the practice of intentionally releasing rabbits on islands has significant and lasting negative ecological impacts, especially on small islands. While a complete recovery of post-rabbit was not evident over the time span of our research, both arthropod and plant data indicate that partial recovery is possible once rabbits have been removed.

AB  - Geese can profoundly affect arctic ecosystems directly (e.g., by grazing vegetation) and indirectly (e.g. by changing nutrient cycling resulting from faces inputs and by reducing plant litter). In the Arctic, behavior and abundance of geese have changed due to climate and land-use change. While the short-term effects of increased goose populations on tundra ecosystems are known, there is a knowledge gap for long-term consequences of goose population changes on nutrient cycling and plant communities, especially in the High-Arctic. Here, we compared wetland sites where geese have been almost absent for at least 50 years (Pond Inlet), and nearby sites where geese are abundant or sites where they have been excluded experimentally by cages and where the ground has been experimentally fertilized for over 16 years (Bylot Island). Long-term goose disappearance increased inorganic nutrients in wetlands through increased plant litter decomposition and changed community composition, likely by altering competitive relationships between three dominant vascular plant species that are different in terms of nutrient acquisition and use. In experimentally fertilized sites, inorganic nutrients were similarly increased, but fertilization had contrast effects on plant community composition compared with herbivory, released plant species from the nutrient limitation and converted wetland habitats to a dryer state. Overall, our results suggest that the direct effects of goose herbivory on vegetation are more profound than their indirect effects through an alternation of nutrient cycling even in nutrient-limited wetlands of the Arctic. These findings emphasize the need to assess long-term direct impacts of herbivores on vegetation.

AB  - Invasive species such as vertebrate herbivores cause threats to native ecosystems through causing changes to vegetation composition and structure, competition, ecosystem engineering, impacts on soil, and through spreading disease. In the mountainous country of Australia, Sambar Deer (Rusa unicolor) are becoming an increasing threat to fragile and endangered ecosystems, which are also facing other significant threats such as climate change. Methods for ameliorating these impacts are currently limited to lethal control programmes through shooting or fencing key areas. Fencing is not a viable option for large areas and can have large logistical costs as well as negative ecological outcomes. This study aimed to compare two shooting methods (ground shooting vs thermally assisted aerial culling with thermal image operator) for controlling sambar at low densities in a mountainous area. This programme was the first to use this specific thermal technique for deer in mountainous country in Australia. We found that thermally assisted aerial culling was more effective for removing Sambar than ground shooting. Thermally assisted aerial culling removed more Sambar in total, shot more animals per hour, covered a larger search area, was cheaper per hectare covered, and had very high "seen", "targeted", and "shot" ratios. Ground shooting sessions were lower in cost overall, but the cost per hectare was higher and rate of Sambar shot was lower than that of thermally assisted aerial culling. Ground shooting did remove more Sambar per hectare as ground shooting focuses on a smaller area, but this advantage is outweighed by the fact that thermally assisted shooting also allowed the concurrent removal of Feral Pigs. This work indicates that thermally assisted aerial culling is the preferred method for effective management of Sambar in an alpine environment. Ground shooting may be beneficial when Sambar are concentrated in key areas or to complement initial knock down by thermally assisted aerial culling.

AB  - Extensive grazing carried out freely by exotic goats represents an important source of anthropogenic degradation in seasonally dry tropical forests of Brazil. The presence of these herbivores may negatively impact the local fauna through the reduction of habitat complexity. In this study, we investigate the effect of goat farming in scorpion assemblage from Brazilian seasonally dry tropical forest. Scorpions were sampled in 36 areas (18 disturbed and 18 undisturbed) distributed in three sites in the seasonally dry tropical forest of Brazil. At each location, we recorded a set of local variables such as litter depth, diameter at breast height of trees, vegetation density (trees and shrubs), and detritus (stones and fallen logs). In total, 396 scorpions were collected, distributed across six species and two families. Our results showed that scorpion diversity was negatively affected, with species richness and abundance reduced in areas influenced by goats. Furthermore, in these sites, the composition of the species was also affected, with habitat-generalist species favoring habitat-specialist species. Finally, sites with free pasture of goats presented scorpions with reduced body condition (body mass and size) than sites without goats. Furthermore, habitat degradation caused by free pasture of goats negatively affects the assemblage of scorpions in terms of their diversity and body condition the seasonally dry tropical forest of Brazil.

AB  - The Ouadi Rime-Ouadi Achim Reserve (Reserve de l'Ouadi Rime-Ouadi Achim) in central Chad supports large numbers of livestock and rare antelopes, and is the site of ongoing reintroductions of the scimitar-horned oryx Oryx dammah and addax Addax nasomaculatus. We present results of surveys conducted during 2011-2019 to examine patterns of relative abundance and distribution of dorcas gazelles Gazella dorcas, dama gazelles Nanger dama and livestock in relation to each other and to water sources in a 3,500 km(2) area in the centre of the Reserve. Dorcas gazelles numbered 7,700-18,000, moving extensively across the area. Livestock varied between c. 2,000 and 68,000 tropical livestock units across surveys, with density doubling in the wet season. Dorcas gazelle distribution was negatively associated with livestock, and livestock density was positively associated with artificial water sources. Dorcas gazelle densities were positively associated with locations where there had been wild fires in the 6 months prior to a survey. Dama gazelles were encountered only 13 times, insufficient to estimate their population size reliably. Opportunistic observations suggest dama gazelles avoid livestock and burnt ground. Our findings highlight the importance of the Reserve. We recommend the designation of a large, well-managed conservation priority zone in the Reserve's core area in which no further development of water resources is permitted. Management of livestock numbers within this zone at or below current levels is essential to integrate national goals for both biodiversity conservation and pastoralism development.

AB  - BackgroundShrub encroachment suppresses ecosystem services of grasslands. Hence, the impact of herbivory and fire as shrub control measures needs to be ascertained for restoration of mesic grasslands.ObjectiveTo assess the impact of fire and wild ungulates on controlling Seriphium plumosum encroachment and restoration of herbaceous vegetation.MethodsFour 50 m x 25 m blocks were selected randomly in a large shrub-encroached site, with blocks demarcated at least 1 km apart in the Telperion Nature Reserve, South Africa. Half of each block was fenced off to exclude wild herbivores (enclosure) and the adjacent half was unfenced (non-enclosure). Two blocks burned in 2020, resulting in the following treatments: fire, herbivory, fire and herbivory combination, and no fire no herbivory. In each treatment, thirty-two 4 m x 4 m subplots were nested to repeatedly survey shrub and herbaceous vegetation.ResultsHerbaceous plant density, diversity, richness, and basal cover declined linearly with increase in shrub cover. All treatments significantly reduced shrub cover, with fire in combination with herbivory reducing it nearly three-fold compared to that in the control. Plant densities and species richness were higher in the treatment with fire and herbivory than in the other treatments, or in the control. For all treatments, the herbaceous canopy cover and diversity were comparable, but significantly higher than in the control.ConclusionsOur findings indicate that integration of burning, and herbivory is best for controlling shrub encroachment and restoration of herbaceous vegetation in mesic grasslands.

AB  - The majority of the world's mammal biomass is domestic livestock. Intensive livestock grazing can negatively impact some elements of biodiversity. We quantified the effects of grazing management on bird occupancy over a 10-year period in patches of Australian endangered temperate woodland within paddocks subjected to one of three grazing regimes: continuous set stocking, rotational, and total livestock exclusion. Grazing may affect birds through altering resource availability, influencing vegetation structure, or affecting the occurrence of noisy miners (Manorina melanocephala), a native honeyeater that engages in interference competition with other birds. Using Bayesian generalized linear mixed models and multispecies occupancy modelling, we quantified relative and interactive effects on bird biodiversity of grazing, vegetation structure, and noisy miner occupancy. We found only muted grazing regime effects on woodland birds. However, many species responded to vegetation structure. Small invertivorous woodland birds responded positively to sapling abundance, and some (larger) species responded positively to the abundance of trees >50 cm. Furthermore, species richness increased with increased sapling abundance and trees >50 cm. The largest effects were associated with noisy miner occurrence, which drove reductions in small-bodied, invertivorous birds, effectively "swamping" the positive effects of vegetation attributes on these species.The profound impacts of noisy miners present challenges for bird conservation in woodland ecosystems, especially those subject to grazing. Management to reduce grazing pressure by domestic livestock may eventually help limit the impacts of the noisy miner, in part by facilitating natural regeneration of temperate woodlands to which small-bodied woodland birds respond positively.

AB  - Central/West Africa is one of the most biodiverse regions on earth and one of the largest producers of cacao, producing about 68.4 % of the world's chocolate. Here, cacao pests and diseases can cause losses of $761 million annually. However, no studies from Africa have quantified the role of flying vertebrates as pest suppressors in cacao plantations. We used an exclusion experiment to prevent access of bats and birds to cacao trees for 12 months and quantified how their absence affected arthropod communities, herbivory, and cacao crop yield. Overall, important pests such as mealybugs and other hemipterans were more abundant in exclosures (9 and 1.6 times increase, respectively), despite potential multitrophic interactions with simultaneously increasing predatory arthropods such as spiders and mantis. Under heavy shade (90 %), cacao trees with flying vertebrate exclosures had 3.9 times fewer flowers and 3.2 times fewer large pods than control trees, corresponding to estimated losses on average of $478 ha(-1)y(-1). Under low tree-level shade cover (10 %) however, the opposite pattern was evident: exclosure trees had 5.2 times more flowers and 3.7 times more large pods than control trees, corresponding to estimated savings on average of $796 ha(-1)y(-1). We demonstrate that the enormous potential of African flying vertebrates as pest suppressors in cacao plantations is dependent on local shade tree management and only economically relevant above 50 % of shade. Despite higher productivity at low shade levels, our findings encourage African policymakers and farmers to adopt more high shade cacao agroforestry systems to maximize pest suppression services provided by bats and birds.

AB  - Kangaroos (Macropus spp., Osphranter sp.) are the most ubiquitous free-ranging herbivores in Australia. Much has been written on their impacts on plant community composition and how they interact with livestock, particularly in extensive rangelands. Little is known, however, about how kangaroos affect soil function and their relationship with healthy soils, nor the impact of peri-urban populations of kangaroos where they might come into conflict with humans. To address this, we used exclosures to examine the impacts of low densities of kangaroos on the morphology of the soil surface in a peri-urban environment on the outskirts of Sydney, Australia. We found that kangaroo grazing was associated with reduced herbaceous biomass and cover, and biocrust cover, and surfaces were generally more stable, had a greater cover and incorporation of litter and had greater plant species richness. There were no differences in indices of nutrient cycling nor stability. Overall, our study supports the notion that kangaroo grazing, at the current low densities experienced in this peri-urban reserve, has had no significant deleterious effect on soil surface health, as measured by the morphology of the surface. We conclude that grazing at the current low levels (similar to 70 km(-2)) is unlikely to have major long-term negative effects on soil surface condition.

AB  - Fire and herbivory are major drivers in tropical savanna ecosystems and they selected a flora composed of species able to cope with recurrent aboveground biomass removal. Renewal of the herbaceous stratum is made possible by resprouting, mostly through a belowground bud bank. Evaluating the impacts of disturbances on the bud bank can assist in predicting post-disturbance responses and system resilience. In a semi-arid savanna, we aimed to verify whether lower fire frequency, fire and herbivory exclusion could affect belowground bud bank and organs diversity and consequently, the resprouting potential. Lower fire frequency or suppression and absence of herbivory were expected to reduce the bud bank density, which was confirmed by our results. If the fire is suppressed or fire frequency is reduced, the total, graminoid and the shrub bud bank decreased, whereas herbivory exclusion resulted in total and a forb bud bank of lower densities. Belowground buds were identified in non-woody and woody rhizomes, stolons, root crowns, and bulbs or corms. Despite having bud banks of lower density, disturbance exclusion promoted belowground biomass accumulation. Our results indicated the importance of maintaining the endogenous disturbances to the preservation of the belowground community and regeneration strategy, guaranteeing resilience in semi-arid savanna communities.

AB  - Native and introduced deer populations have expanded on many continents and are now considered primary drivers of ecosystem degradation. Large herbivore management can be controversial, requiring appropriate tools to gauge impacts and guide management decisions. While many different protocols have been proposed to measure deer impacts to vegetation, few have been experimentally validated to assess whether they respond reliably to changes in deer browse intensity. Here we used a network of large (2 ha) long-term deer exclosures in New York State to assess utility and reliability of AVID (Assessing Vegetation Impacts of Deer), the Ten-Tallest, and Twig-Age protocols to capture changes in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) browse intensity. We also assessed whether three herbaceous species: blue-stemmed goldenrod (Solidago caesia), white wood aster (Eurybia divaricata), and zigzag goldenrod (Solidago flexicaulis) could expand upon a red oak (Quercus rubra) Sentinel protocol. Finally, we evaluated whether these four protocols adhered to criteria defined for ecological indicator selection. AVID, Ten-Tallest, and Twig-Age protocols rely on existing vegetation to measure deer browse intensity, which limited their ability to adhere to basic sampling principles and be standardized across different forest types, especially in areas with little vegetation remaining in browse height. The Ten-Tallest protocol did not consis-tently detect differences in deer browse intensity, calling into question its scientific validity. The Sentinel pro-tocol utilizes propagated and planted species, which standardizes impact assessments across sites and captures annual changes in deer browse intensity. Sentinel met nearly all criteria required to function as a reliable deer browse indicator. Validation and selection of additional sentinel species is necessary to build out a portfolio of regionally relevant species that can gauge deer browse intensity across vegetation and habitat types. Of the herbaceous species evaluated, S. caesia showed promise as a new sentinel species, but further evaluations are necessary. Evidence-based deer management will require scientifically rigorous and validated impact monitoring approaches and metrics. We caution against adopting protocols that have not been thoroughly vetted to avoid misguided deer management and policy.

AB  - Interspecific niche complementarity is a key mechanism posited to explain positive species richness-productivity relationships in plant communities. However, the exact nature of the niche dimensions that plant species partition remains poorly known. Species may partition abiotic resources that limit their growth, but species may also be specialized with respect to their set of biotic interactions with other trophic levels, in particular with enemies including pathogens and consumers. The lower host densities present in more species-diverse plant communities may therefore result in smaller populations of specialized enemies, and in a smaller associated negative feedback these enemies exert on plant productivity. To test whether such host density-dependent effects of enemies drive diversity-productivity relationships in young forest stands, we experimentally manipulated leaf fungal pathogens and insect herbivores in a large subtropical forest biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiment in China (BEF-China). We found that fungicide spraying of tree canopies removed the positive tree-species richness-productivity relationship present in untreated control plots. The tree species that contributed the most to this effect were the ones with the highest fungicide-induced growth increase in monoculture. Insecticide application did not cause comparable effects. Synthesis. Our findings suggest that tree species diversity may not only promote productivity by interspecific resource-niche partitioning but also by trophic niche partitioning. Most likely, partitioning occurred with respect to enemies such as pathogenic fungi. Alternatively, similar effects on tree growth would have occurred if fungicide had eliminated positive effects of a higher diversity of beneficial fungi (e.g. mycorrhizal symbionts) that may have occurred in mixed tree species communities.

AB  - Eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems is a serious global issue. Stream nitrate concentrations at the University of Tokyo Chichibu Forest have increased since 2000 after the opening of the new highway in 1998. Nitrogen oxide emissions from automobile exhausts were the most likely source of increased nitrate input in the forest ecosystem. Around the area, the sika deer Cervus nippon Temminck population has greatly increased since around 2000 and intensively browsed the understory vegetation. We hypothesized that the degradation of the understory vegetation caused by the deer overpopulation was one of the causes of increased nitrate output. Monthly observations were carried out from April to October 2013 to investigate the understory vegetation at the heights of 0-30 and 100-150 cm above the ground inside (without deer) and outside (with deer) of a deer exclusion fence. Plant taxa and % coverage of each taxon at each layer were recorded. The in vivo nitrate reductase activity (NRA) (approximate to nitrate assimilation rate) was determined for each plant taxa each month. Compared to inside the fence, the understory vegetation outside was poor with smaller % coverage and less diverse community structure, and was occupied by unpalatable plant taxa that were uncommon or absent inside the fence. Contrary to our expectation, the phylogenetic diversity of the community assemblage outside the fence showed greater evenness (less clustering) than inside. The NRA peaked in early in the season or late in the season. In contrast to a previous report, no significant difference in the NRA was found between woody and herbaceous plants. Although the difference was no more than that of vegetation coverage, the estimated community-level NRA inside the fence was 5.6 times higher than that of the outside. The difference was greatest early in the season. These results support our hypothesis.

AB  - Timber harvest can have spatially and temporally varying effects on wildlife populations. To explore the response of Sitka black-tailed deer ( Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis ) to commercial forestry we performed habitat selection analyses (HSAs) based on data across 3 spatial scales (step selection, home range, and study area) and 4 seasons in relation to logging-related covariates (logged areas and roads) and LiDAR-derived vegetation metrics (canopy and understory cover).We deployed global positioning system (GPS) collars on 61 female deer in a coastal temperate rainforest (Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, USA). Deer response to young ( <30 year) and old ( >= 30) logged stands was equivocal across seasons and scales, though there was a tendency for deer to avoid older logged areas at the home range scale. However, both within and outside of logged stands, deer avoided areas of greater canopy cover and selected areas with more understory. Deer selected areas near logging roads that were open to vehicle traffic and were neutral towards closed roads. Although there was variation in individual deer habitat selection patterns, the overall population response was generally consistent across seasons and scales. Our results suggest that forest structure rather than logging status was more influential to deer habitat selection and that deer responded to road status (open or closed to vehicle traffic). Forest management activities (timber harvest and restoration) that promote understory and reduce canopy cover may increase habitat selected by deer.

AB  - Aoudad (Ammotragus lervia), native to northern Africa, were introduced as exotic game animals to the Chihuahuan Desert in West Texas, USA, and have become invasive. Aoudad and bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) are adapted to rugged terrain in arid climates, and both persist in desert regions with low primary productivity and limited perennial water availability, which suggests potential for competition for food and water resources. Aoudad are highly adaptable, which could make them more resilient to a changing environment with extreme conditions, providing a competitive edge over bighorn sheep. To evaluate the potential for exploitative competition between invasive aoudad and endemic desert bighorn sheep, we used genetic metabarcoding to assess diet composition using fecal samples collected from adults of each species in the Sierra Vieja Mountains in West Texas. We collected 32 composite samples from aoudad and 27 composite samples for bighorn sheep and identified 88 genera consumed. Bighorn sheep and aoudad diets (as inferred by genera) were most different during the warm-wet season (16 June-15 October; Kulczynski similarity index = 0.81) and most similar during the warm-dry season (16 February-15 June; Kulczynski similarity index = 1.05). During the warm-wet season, the 2 herbivores tended to consume different genera, suggesting the possibility of resource partitioning, with less likelihood of resource partitioning during the warm-dry season when forage was more limited and diets were similar. Diet diversity, measured by Shannon's diversity index, did not vary substantially between species, but for aoudad it was highest during the warm-wet season (1.1 +/- 0.0.1 [SE]) and lowest during the cool-dry season (16 October-15 February, 0.9 +/- 0.0.1). For bighorn sheep, diet richness was highest during the cool-dry season (1.1 +/- 0.2) and lowest during the warm-dry season (0.8 +/- 0.10). Bighorn sheep may specialize on high-quality forage species, particularly during the warm-wet season, while aoudad have a more generalist foraging strategy, although temporal windows for increased competition for food resources likely occur. Aoudad are well-adapted to low-quality forage and arid climates, which could increase their competitive ability and compromise bighorn sheep conservation efforts in areas of sympatry.

AB  - Seamounts are thought to function as hotspots of megafauna diversity due to their topology and environmental characteristics. However, assessments of megafauna communities inhabiting seamounts, including diversity and density, are scarce. In this study, we provide megafauna diversity and density estimates for a recently discovered, not yet characterized seamount region (Boetius seamounts) west of Cape Verde (N17 degrees 16 ', W29 degrees 26 '). We investigated the distribution of epibenthic megafauna over a large depth gradient from the seamount's summit at 1400 m down to 3200 m water depth and provided qualitative and quantitative analyses based on quantified video data. In utilizing an ocean floor observation system (OFOS), calibrated videos were taken as a horizontal transect from the north-eastern flank of the seamount, differentiating between an upper, coral-rich region (-1354/-2358 m) and a deeper, sponge-rich region (-2358/-3218 m). Taxa were morphologically distinguished, and their diversity and densities were estimated and related to substrate types. Both the upper and deeper seamount region hosted unique communities with significantly higher megafauna richness at the seamount's summit. Megafauna densities differed significantly between the upper (0.297 +/- 0.167 Ind./m2) and deeper community (0.112 +/- 0.114 Ind./m). The seamount showed a vertical zonation with dense aggregations of deep-sea corals dominating the seamount's upper region and colonies of the glass sponges Poliopogon amadou dominating the deeper region. The results are discussed in light of detected substrate preferences and co-occurrence of species and are compared with findings from other Atlantic seamounts.

AB  - Recently, plant DNA analysis of feces has been successfully used to evaluate the food species composition of sika deer Cervus nippon. Here, we applied this method to Yaku-sika C. nippon yakushimae, which increased its population and had a great negative impact on understory vegetation in Yakushima Island. We identified food plants of C. nippon yakushimae by sequencing chloroplast DNA fragments (rbcL region) of plants remaining in feces collected in the field in April, June, August, and October 2018, using a next-generation sequencer. We collected feces from populations in two areas where populations have been managed by capture and three areas where those were not managed. The top two food plants in terms of the number of sequences determined were evergreen tall trees in all five areas. In addition to evergreen trees, understory herbaceous plants, including ferns, were included in the top 15 taxa in all areas. The diversity of food plants was higher in the managed areas than in the unmanaged areas. These results indicate that evergreen tall trees are the primary food plants of C. nippon yakushimae, but deer also forage on herbaceous plants as a side dish. Under this side dish effect, understory vegetation is reduced even under the high availability of food resources from tall trees. The high diversity of food plants in the managed areas suggested that understory plant diversity was restored when deer density was reduced by management.

AB  - Introduction Climate warming, combined with grazing pressures, poses significant challenges to vegetation cover and ecosystem stability. In particular, livestock grazing is a primary factor in vegetation degradation, adversely affecting plant diversity, soil health, and key ecological interactions.Methods This study investigates the impact of grazing on vegetation in the Alborz region of Iran, focusing on the comparison between native herbivores (Artiodactyla) and livestock in the Central Alborz Protected Area (CAPA). We utilized 30 years of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data from May to June (1994-2024) to assess vegetation dynamics and evaluate the influence of climate and grazing. ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and regression analyses were performed to identify relationships between vegetation cover, climate variables (temperature and rainfall), and grazing intensity.Results Results show a significant increase in vegetation cover, with Golestanak (without livestock) exhibiting a stronger positive response to climate variables (R-2 = 65%), while Z & amacr;noos (higher livestock density) showed greater variability (R-2 = 58%). Vegetation in Golestanak demonstrated a more significant positive correlation with temperature and rainfall, reflecting resilience to climatic stressors and the beneficial effect of moderate grazing by native Artiodactyla. In contrast, Z & amacr;noos showed more fluctuation in vegetation trends due to high livestock grazing pressure.Discussion This study highlights that while climate warming can positively affect vegetation cover, intensive livestock grazing can impede these gains, underlining the importance of adaptive management strategies for maintaining ecosystem health.

AB  - Food webs can be conceptualized as being powered by energy derived from living and dead vegetation, respectively. Most food web research has focused on "green food webs " which begin with the consumption of living vegetation by herbivores. However, "brown food webs " which stem from the consumption of senescent vegetation by detritivores are also an important channel of energy transfer. In theory, herbivores have the potential to disrupt brown food webs by consuming plant material before it can senesce and become available for detritivores. Here we investigate the effects that grazing by kangaroos, whose population had irrupted partly due to the absence of an apex predator, has on the brown food web in an arid environment. We compared the cover of living and dead vegetation, the abundances of detritivorous termites and their predators inside one ha herbivore exclosures and nearby control plots. Results show there was more cover of living and dead vegetation inside the exclosures. Similarly, abundances of termites and small vertebrate predators of termites were greater inside the exclosures. Our study provides evidence that consumption of plant material by irruptive herbivores can disrupt the functioning of the brown food web by reducing the flow of energy from plant biomass to termites which in turn translates to reduced abundances of termites and small vertebrates that feed on termites. Our findings have implications for conservation and management because they shed light on a previously unconsidered threat to the functioning of arid ecosystems, disruption of brown food webs by irruptive herbivores.

AB  - Large herbivore communities are changing globally, with populations of wild herbivores generally declining while domestic herbivore populations are increasing, influencing ecosystem function along with the impacts of climate change. Manipulative experiments have rarely captured the interaction between patterns of large herbivore assemblage change and climatic conditions. This interaction may affect the functional traits and functional diversity of herbaceous communities; this requires investigation, as these metrics have been useful proxies for ecosystem function. We used a large herbivore exclosure experiment replicated along a topo-climatic gradient to explore the interaction between climate and herbivore assemblage on community-level functional traits and the functional diversity of herbaceous plant understories. Our findings demonstrate interacting effects between large herbivore assemblages and climate. We found a shift from drought-tolerant traits to drought-avoidant traits with increasing aridity, specifically with regard to plant leaf area and specific leaf area. We also determined that plant community responses to grazing changed from an herbivore avoidance strategy at drier sites to a more herbivore-tolerant strategy at wetter sites. We observed that the effects of herbivores on community-level traits can sometimes counteract those of climate. Finally, we found that cattle and large wild herbivores can differ in the magnitude and direction of effects on functional traits and diversity.

AB  - Recently expanded estimates for when humans arrived on Madagascar (up to approximately 10 000 years ago) highlight questions about the causes of the island's relatively late megafaunal extinctions (approximately 2000-500 years ago). Introduced domesticated animals could have contributed to extinctions, but the arrival times and past diets of exotic animals are poorly known. To conduct the first explicit test of the potential for competition between introduced livestock and extinct endemic megafauna in southern and western Madagascar, we generated new radiocarbon and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data from the bone collagen of introduced ungulates (zebu cattle, ovicaprids and bushpigs, n = 66) and endemic megafauna (pygmy hippopotamuses, giant tortoises and elephant birds, n = 68), and combined these data with existing data from endemic megafauna (n = 282, including giant lemurs). Radiocarbon dates confirm that introduced and endemic herbivores briefly overlapped chronologically in this region between 1000 and 800 calibrated years before present (cal BP). Moreover, stable isotope data suggest that goats, tortoises and hippos had broadly similar diets or exploited similar habitats. These data support the potential for both direct and indirect forms of competition between introduced and endemic herbivores. We argue that competition with introduced herbivores, mediated by opportunistic hunting by humans and exacerbated by environmental change, contributed to the late extinction of endemic megafauna on Madagascar.

AB  - Alpine ecosystems in the arid southwestern United States are vulnerable to climate change. Many of these ecosystems are experiencing increased recreational use and introductions of nonindigenous ungulates. In the La Sal Mountains of southeastern Utah, alpine plant communities support an endemic plant species, Erigeron mancus, 11 plant and two animal species of conservation concern, and a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service Research Natural Area. Nonindigenous mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) were introduced by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (UDWR) in 2013 and 2014, and recreational use has increased in the intervening period. To evaluate potential effects of mountain goat and recreational use, vegetation monitoring was initiated by the USDA Forest Service in 2016. We used 5 y monitoring data (2016-2020) and generalized linear mixed models to analyze the separate and interacting effects of year, recreational use, and mountain goat use on: (1) populations of plant species of conservation concern; (2) vascular and nonvascular plant cover; and (3) ground cover. Our analyses revealed decreases in proportional frequency of E. mancus at the end of the monitoring. Proportional cover of dominant plant growth forms, especially forbs, declined, while proportional cover of litter and ineffective ground cover (bare soil and pavement) increased. Recreational or goat use were a factor in several of the observed changes, although weather and climate likely also influenced the results. Management complexity arises because of the different missions of USDA Forest Service and UDWR, but adjustments in mountain goat numbers and recreational use may be needed to maintain ecologically resilient ecosystems. Continued monitoring can provide the basis for adaptive management.

AB  - Mediterranean ecosystems have been grazed by livestock for thousands of years. While considered both a major anthropogenic stressor and a potential habitat conservation tool, the effects of livestock grazing on vertebrate populations remain poorly understood. Our study focused on goat and sheep grazing on a large island off the coast of Greece in order to shed light on (1) the nature of the relationship between livestock grazing and vertebrate assemblages, and (2) the mediating mechanisms. Sampling small mammal, reptile, and passerine bird species across a range of livestock grazing intensities in a Mediterranean pastoral system, we used Generalized Linear Modeling to test for the presence of a unimodal relationship between grazing disturbance and vertebrate diversity in line with the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH). An information-theoretic approach helped elucidate which habitat characteristics best predicted vertebrate-grazing responses. Terrestrial species abundance decreased steadily with increasing grazing, while species richness exhibited a unimodal response, peaking at intermediate livestock stocking rates and offering support for the IDH. This response was best predicted by invertebrate food availability. Both passerine bird species' richness and abundance showed no clear relationship with grazing yet were significantly correlated with changes in vegetation structure. Our findings suggest that there is no ideal grazing level for broadly optimizing both vertebrate abundance and richness. However, only light-to-intermediate livestock stocking rates are associated with healthy wildlife populations while also promoting terrestrial species richness. Agricultural policy that avoids overgrazing while encouraging a mosaic of different grazing intensities at the regional level is needed to best support diverse vertebrate assemblages.

AB  - Herbivores drive shifts in plant species composition by interacting with vegetation through defoliation, trampling and nutrient addition: urine and faeces. As herbivore effects on vegetation accumulate over time, they might spillover to other trophic levels, but how and when this happens is poorly understood. Since it is methodologically demanding to measure biodiversity across spatial gradients, an alternative approach is to assess it through biodiversity indices of vascular plants. We employed the Index of biodiversity relevance developed for Swedish flora which provides an estimated number of organisms associated with a plant species, allowing the quantification of trophic community size. Values from this index were coupled with vegetation data from a network of 96 fenced and paired grazed plots across Fennoscandia. We analysed the role herbivory has on plant richness and diversity, and on the number of organisms that interact with the vegetation according to the index values. We also explored how herbivores influence the competitive effects of tall shrubs on other plants since the dominance of a vegetation type links directly to biodiversity. Plant diversity had no clear response to grazing. Overall vegetation and the vegetation subgroups herbs and non-fruit shrubs had higher biodiversity index values in fenced plots, indicating a higher number of plant-host interactions. Herb cover was negatively related to shrubs in both treatments but with a faster decline in the absence of herbivores. This study highlights the importance of maintaining herbivore populations in the Arctic to conserve the vegetation structure and biodiversity of the tundra. This method of coupling biodiversity indexes with vegetation data provides complementary information to the plant diversity, especially when methodological or time constraints prevent complete field inventories.

AB  - Dominance often indicates one or a few species being best suited for resource capture and retention in a given environment. Press perturbations that change availability of limiting resources can restructure competitive hierarchies, allowing new species to capture or retain resources and leaving once dominant species fated to decline. However, dominant species may maintain high abundances even when their new environments no longer favour them due to stochastic processes associated with their high abundance, impeding deterministic processes that would otherwise diminish them.Here, we quantify the persistence of dominance by tracking the rate of decline in dominant species at 90 globally distributed grassland sites under experimentally elevated soil nutrient supply and reduced vertebrate consumer pressure.We found that chronic experimental nutrient addition and vertebrate exclusion caused certain subsets of species to lose dominance more quickly than in control plots. In control plots, perennial species and species with high initial cover maintained dominance for longer than annual species and those with low initial cover respectively. In fertilized plots, species with high initial cover maintained dominance at similar rates to control plots, while those with lower initial cover lost dominance even faster than similar species in controls. High initial cover increased the estimated time to dominance loss more strongly in plots with vertebrate exclosures than in controls. Vertebrate exclosures caused a slight decrease in the persistence of dominance for perennials, while fertilization brought perennials' rate of dominance loss in line with those of annuals. Annual species lost dominance at similar rates regardless of treatments.Synthesis. Collectively, these results point to a strong role of a species' historical abundance in maintaining dominance following environmental perturbations. Because dominant species play an outsized role in driving ecosystem processes, their ability to remain dominant-regardless of environmental conditions-is critical to anticipating expected rates of change in the structure and function of grasslands. Species that maintain dominance while no longer competitively favoured following press perturbations due to their historical abundances may result in community compositions that do not maximize resource capture, a key process of system responses to global change.
   The ability of plant species to maintain dominance following environmental perturbations can govern further changes in ecosystem functions. The authors detail the conditions that promote the maintenance of dominance following fertilization and loss of vertebrate herbivores. They found that species with higher initial relative cover are able to maintain dominance for longer time periods even when they eventually decline.image

AB  - Fragmented suburban forests of the northeastern US are challenged by abundant white-tailed deer and nonindigenous plant invasions. Deer browsing/grazing pressure varies among sites, potentially affecting herbivory on nonindigenous plants and their invasion success. We aimed to identify a useful deer pressure indicator for suburban forests and then use it to relate deer pressure to grazing on and abundance of two herbaceous invaders, Microstegum vimineum and Alliaria petiolata. We compared three indicators: fecal pellet accumulation rate, deer browse on indigenous woody plants, and indigenous shrub layer cover. The pellet method produced estimates generally far below the region's known deer density. Browse rates and shrub layer cover were negatively correlated, and correlations of the three indicators with evidence of deer pressure from a subsequent 6.5-year exclosure experiment supported shrub layer cover as the better choice. Using that measure in 10 forests, we detected a weak pattern of more grazed stands under greater deer pressure, but few plants per stand were grazed; any negative influence of deer on these species was limited to individuals, without population effects. Alliaria petiolata abundance was unrelated to deer pressure, but M. vimineum abundance was greater in forests with more deer pressure, suggesting facilitation of its invasion.

AB  - Both bottom-up and top-down processes modulate plant communities. Fungal and oomycete pathogens are most common in global grasslands, and due to differences in their physiology, function, host range, and life cycles, they may differentially affect plants (in both intensity and direction). However, how fungal and oomycete pathogens regulate bottom-up and top-down effects on plant community biomass remains unclear. To this end, we conducted a 3-year field experiment in an alpine meadow incorporating mammalian herbivore exclosure, fungicide/oomyceticide application, and nitrogen addition treatments. We arranged 12 blocks with half randomly assigned to be mammalian herbivore exclosures (fenced to exclude grazing sheep), and the other half were fenced most of the year but not in winter (winter grazing control). Six 2.5 x 2.5 m square plots were established in each block, with each of the six plots assigned as control, nitrogen addition, fungicide application, oomyceticide application, nitrogen addition + fungicide application, and nitrogen addition + oomyceticide application. We found that fungicide application significantly increased plant community biomass (mainly Poaceae species) under nitrogen addition and promoted the bottom-up effect of nitrogen addition on plant community biomass by altering the community-weighted mean of plant height (via species turnover). Meanwhile, oomyceticide application significantly increased plant community biomass (mainly Poaceae species) when mammalian herbivores were excluded and weakened the top-down effect of winter grazing on plant community biomass by driving intraspecific variation in plant height. Our results highlight that fungal and oomycete pathogens play important (but differing) roles in mediating the effects of nutrient availability and higher trophic levels on plant community biomass. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that plant pathogen-related modulation of plant community biomass is achieved by alterations to plant height. Overall, this study combines both community and disease ecology to reveal complex interactions among higher trophic levels and their potential impacts on terrestrial ecosystem functioning under human disturbance.

AB  - Compound disturbances are anticipated to increase under global change, potentially resulting in unpredictable forest recovery dynamics, especially in managed forests where salvage logging is often routine, yet studies quantifying forest resilience to compound disturbances are still scarce. We investigated resilience to an ice storm event, followed by a spruce bark beetle outbreak and subsequent salvage logging in a temperate sub-montane forest landscape in Slovenia. The study landscape was characterized by a gradient in pre-disturbance proportion of spruce, an important species for the forest economy, ranging from mixed fir-beech-spruce forest to spruce monocultures. Given that the bark beetle only affected spruce, this gradient in spruce proportion provided an opportunity to investigate forest resilience across a severity gradient ranging from undamaged areas to complete canopy removal over patches of several hectares. We assessed multiple dimensions of resilience across this disturbance severity gradient, namely i) post-disturbance forest structural and species diversity, ii) radial growth of surviving trees, and iii) post-disturbance regeneration, including measurements made in deer exclosures. The results highlight the low resilience of spruce-dominated stands in terms of low structural and species diversity of the recovering forests, once spruce is removed due to disturbance. However, measures of post-disturbance structural diversity were higher in stands were spruce made up < 50 % of the tree composition. This result may help forest managers to plan how much spruce to maintain in mixture with species less vulnerable to climate change. We also showed that surviving canopy trees with damaged crowns can sustain high radial growth resilience, which calls into question the efficacy of immediate post-disturbance salvaging of damaged trees. Finally, we quantified the detrimental impact of ungulate browsing on the recruitment of post-disturbance regeneration, particularly for highly palatable species, which showed significantly lower aggregate height, a metric combining density and tree height, outside of deer exclosures. We stress the importance of actively controlling ungulate populations for successful post-disturbance recruitment of silviculturally important palatable species, such as silver fir and sycamore maple.

AB  - The paper evaluates the experience of intentional introduction of mammals into Yakutia. The total of eight alien and one native mammal species were introduced during the period between 1930 and 2020. Two alien species (the muskrat and American mink) naturalized successfully, as well as the reintroduced sable. Introduction of the muskox launched in 1996 has proved successful, and with the proper conservation measures, one can expect a further increase in its abundance and expansion of its range to cover the entire tundra zone of Yakutia. Attempts to introduce the Eurasian beaver, raccoon dog, steppe polecat, and domestic yak have failed. Efforts on the introduction of the wood bison continue, but its reproduction rate and specifics of its winter behavior and feeding habits suggest difficulties in the adaptation to new climate conditions. Intentional introduction of alien species poses a potential threat to ecosystems of the North, particularly from attempting to reconstruct paleofauna by introducing the species characteristic of paleolandscapes rather than recent fauna of the region. In the absence of the comprehensive biological analysis, efforts directed at "increasing the biodiversity" can lead to disturbance of the balance of the northern ecosystems.

AB  - The Arctic wolf (Canis lupus arctos) is a predator of muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus), Arctic hares (Lepus arcticus), and endangered Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi) in the Canadian High Arctic. Although Arctic wolves potentially affect the dynamics of muskoxen and Peary caribou populations, knowledge about their abundance, distribution, and predation patterns is limited. Inuit and Inuvialuit communities value these species for sociocultural and subsistence reasons, and community members are concerned about how interactions among these species and their environment may change in a warming, unpredictable Arctic. We conducted a study from 2014-2018 of wolves in the rolling tundra of central Ellesmere Island (Fosheim Peninsula) and eastern Axel Heiberg Island. This area supported relatively high densities of muskoxen and Arctic hares, and previously supported Peary caribou, although caribou were mostly absent in the area during our study. We deployed global positioning system (GPS) radio-collars on 10 adult wolves in 6 packs on Ellesmere and Axel Heiberg islands to describe wolf density and predation patterns. Wolves were neither nomadic nor migratory; they remained on territories year-round, with summer densities of 2.5-8.0 adult wolves/1,000 km2 and 3.7-10.4 wolves/1,000 km2 including pups. Based on a ground search of 312 of 868 location clusters over a 340-day period, wolves in a focal study pack killed approximately 0.12 muskoxen/day, equivalent to a predation rate of 5.5-17.0% of the estimated muskox population (older than 10 months old). This predation rate is likely sustainable given that calves and yearlings rather than reproductive adults comprised most documented kills, and that muskox populations can increase at rates up to 20%. The kill rate for this pack also implied a biomass intake deficit of 0.82-1.63 kg/wolf/day that could have been offset by each wolf consuming 115-228 Arctic hares annually. The decline of Peary caribou in the study area precluded any assessment of wolf predation influences on their population, but annual telemetry data confirming the year-round presence of a wolf-ungulate-hare system with relatively high wolf densities suggests that apparent competition could present a challenge to Peary caribou recovery efforts.

AB  - Context Ungulates have been introduced to many environments around the world. Some of these populations have become invasive, resulting in severe economic, social, and environmental impacts. In 1886, chital deer (Axis axis) were introduced to north Queensland, Australia, and the population has since grown and expanded.Aims To understand where chital deer are likely to occur in the future, we examined the relationship between chital deer abundance and environmental variables at two scales, namely, local and regional.Methods The local scale was surveyed using camera traps on a single property, and regional scale data were collected from a landholder survey of properties across the current distribution of chital deer in the region.Key results High predicted soil phosphorus was correlated with high relative abundance of chital deer at both the local and regional scales. In addition, at the local scale, higher predicted soil sodium content and normalised vegetation index (NDVI, 'greenness'), close proximity to homesteads and highways, and lower canopy cover and height were strongly correlated with increased chital deer abundance.Conclusions There were more chital in areas with high predicted soil phosphorus at both local and regional scales.Implications This study has the following two implications for management: (1) areas with high predicted soil phosphorous content had the highest relative abundance of deer at both scales, and should be the focus of control efforts, and (2) such areas are more vulnerable to future invasion of chital deer and should be monitored closely.

AB  - In northern hardwood forests, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) impact both tree regeneration and groundlayer composition, leading to a dominance of American beech (Fagus grandifolia), an unpalatable species, as well as a reduction of preferred groundlayer species. Deer become especially problematic in areas with beech bark disease, such as at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. We analyzed datasets from Sleeping Bear Dunes, collected in 2009 and 2018, to assess vegetation change in three management units: a mainland unit with a long history of deer occupancy, and two islands, one with high deer pressure and one with no known history of permanent deer presence. For each unit, we tested for change in species richness and mean coefficient of conservatism. We also examined the groundlayer, testing for change in indices of abundance and size of preferred and avoided species. Finally, we compared regeneration of palatable and unpalatable tree species. We found increased nonnative species richness, decreased number and abundance of preferred herbaceous species, as well as decreased height of a preferred species. We also detected increased sapling density of beech while that of palatable species declined. Our data provide further evidence of the impacts of white-tailed deer on the forest understory. Management goals should focus on maintaining deer densities at or below 5 deer km(-2) in order to promote growth of the full suite of herbaceous species typical of the region and habitat and to allow adequate regeneration of the overstory.

AB  - Axis deer Axis axis have been widely introduced to new geographic ranges, and in the United States, free-ranging axis deer have become well established in the Edwards Plateau ecoregion as well as other portions of Texas. However, no estimates of axis deer population density nor size have been conducted since 1994. It is hypothesized that axis deer on the Edwards Plateau are potentially competing with native white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus for food, space, and habitat resources, and causing damage to important riparian habitats. Our goal was to estimate regional densities of axis deer and white-tailed deer, and provide insight about the potential impacts axis deer may have on native wildlife and their habitats. Estimated using distance sampling techniques in 2018 and 2019, average axis deer density was 19.7 (95% CI: 14.1-25.6) axis deer/km2 compared with 23.0 (95% CI: 18.2-27.5) white-tailed deer/km2, and axis deer densities ranged from 16.9 to 171.0/km2 among eight different land cover types in Kimble County, Texas, with a county-wide estimate of 61,078 (95% CI: 30,407-100,369) axis deer. Axis deer densities were greatest in riparian land cover types, and they selected for two riparian land cover types and upland grasslands. Axis deer population estimates clearly indicate their population size has increased substantially since introduction to Texas in the 1930s. Population management of axis deer is warranted to limit impacts to native wildlife from potential habitat usurpation, or damage to riparian vegetation communities, soil, and water quality.

AB  - Birds, bats and ants are recognised as significant arthropod predators. However, empirical studies reveal inconsistent trends in their relative roles in top-down control across strata. Here, we describe the differences between forest strata in the separate effects of birds, bats and ants on arthropod densities and their cascading effects on plant damage. We implemented a factorial design to exclude vertebrates and ants in both the canopy and understorey. Additionally, we separately excluded birds and bats from the understorey using diurnal and nocturnal exclosures. At the end of the experiments, we collected all arthropods and assessed herbivory damage. Arthropods responded similarly to predator exclusion across forest strata, with a density increase of 81% on trees without vertebrates and 53% without both vertebrates and ants. Additionally, bird exclusion alone led to an 89% increase in arthropod density, while bat exclusion resulted in a 63% increase. Herbivory increased by 42% when vertebrates were excluded and by 35% when both vertebrates and ants were excluded. Bird exclusion alone increased herbivory damage by 28%, while the exclusion of bats showed a detectable but non-significant increase (by 22%). In contrast, ant exclusion had no significant effect on arthropod density or herbivory damage across strata. Our results reveal that the effects of birds and bats on arthropod density and herbivory damage are similar between the forest canopy and understorey in this temperate forest. In addition, ants were not found to be significant predators in our system. Furthermore, birds, bats and ants appeared to exhibit antagonistic relationships in influencing arthropod density. These findings highlight, unprecedentedly, the equal importance of birds and bats in maintaining ecological balance across different strata of a temperate forest.
   Our study is the first to experimentally investigate the independent and combined impacts of bats, birds and ants on arthropod densities and subsequent herbivory damage across the canopy and understorey temperate forest layers. We found no vertical gradient in top-down control importance in the forest.image

AB  - The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau alpine grassland is experiencing shrub encroachment, which threatens the livelihoods of local nomads. Livestock exclusion management policies have also been implemented in this grassland. It has been predicted that shrubs here will likely encroach after long-term yak elimination, but this inference is not supported by a manipulation experiment. To determine how shrubs respond to livestock grazing cessation, we investigated Potentilla fruticose L. characteristics and properties of herbs and soil in a 'livestock exclusion-free grazing' system with exclosure experiments of 9, 17, and 23 years in the northeast region of the Plateau. We showed that each characteristic of shrub growth and reproduction was significantly greater in exclosures than in control plots, and shrub properties enhancements by livestock exclusion increased over time. We further found that this livestock exclusion induced-shrub encroachment was related not only to the exclusion of livestock's direct disturbances but also to the competitive advantage gain of shrubs through plant-plant interactions and improvement of resources in deep soil for shrubs. Given the negative influences of shrub encroachment, especially lowering rangeland quality, livestock exclusion management in alpine grasslands should be used with caution.

AB  - Variability in large mammalian herbivores can reshape smaller animal communities in complex ways. Accordingly, conservation strategies require a deeper understanding of the extent to which mesoherbivores (>20-1000 kg) and megaherbivores (>1000 kg) influence on animal communities are mediated by changes to vegetation structure, and the extent to which the influence of megaherbivores overlap with mesoherbivores. Using an exclusion experiment, we examined how megaherbivores altered mesoherbivore activity and how both groups influenced small mammals. We compared influences that were mediated by broad metrics of vegetation structure (i.e., indirect effects) with all other influences that were not mediated by vegetation structure (e.g., direct effects). We found megaherbivores were linked to increased mesoherbivore activity, particularly grazers, through both vegetation structure-mediated and other pathways. Alternatively, we found small mammals were suppressed where megaherbivores were present, and their population fluctuations were explained by both structure-mediated and other pathways. Small mammal abundance was higher where large herbivores were excluded compared to open plots, with no difference between plots excluding only megaherbivores and those excluding all herbivores. This suggests that these effects were produced by either megaherbivores alone, or by megaherbivores in conjunction with the increased mesoherbivore activity they facilitated. While small mammal abundance was linked to mesoherbivore-induced changes in grass biomass, their non-linear response, did not correspond with the exclusion of mesoherbivores. These findings highlight megaherbivores' capacity to reshape animal communities through interactions beyond broad metrics of vegetation structure, underscoring the importance of considering the varied influences of megaherbivores on mammal communities in conservation strategies.

AB  - Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) is an invasive shrub introduced to the U.S. in the late 1800s for ornamental use. Since its introduction, it has spread throughout the eastern U.S., becoming especially problematic in urban and peri-urban forest fragments. Once introduced in an ecosystem, L. maackii establishes a dense thicket that restricts understory light and alters understory plant communities. This study monitored the flowering early spring floral community in forests with varying densities of L. maackii (high, low, and no-density) before and after L. maackii removal in Raven Run Nature Sanctuary, a natural area on the outskirts of Lexington, KY, U.S. In plots from which L. maackii was removed, we documented higher flowering spring flora abundance (102-125%), diversity (32%), and richness (47%) compared to plots from which L. maackii was not removed. While abundance did not vary with prior L. maackii density, diversity and richness were 40% and 53% higher, respectively, in plots with low prior L. maackii density than high prior L. maackii density. Finally, flowering plant assemblages were similar across prior L. maackii density (low vs. high) but differed with L. maackii removal treatment (removed vs. unremoved and no L. maackii vs. removed). Flowering spring plants quickly recover after L. maackii removal, but some residual effects of L. maackii continue to structure understory plant communities even after removal. Early removal of. L. maackii from invaded stands and continued management to prevent re-introduction are essential to support recovery of diverse understory plant communities in affected forests.

AB  - Questions Inter-annual variability in precipitation is expected to increase in grasslands, potentially causing additional stress to systems already impacted by anthropogenic activities such as livestock grazing, which can induce changes to grassland vegetation. Yet, the sensitivity of key ecosystem functions to these co-occurring factors is often overlooked. Here, we determine: (a) the effects of grazing on the sensitivity of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP sensitivity) to inter-annual variation in water-year precipitation (the sum of precipitation from September through to the following August); (b) whether ANPP sensitivity to precipitation is associated with shifts induced by grazing in functional group biomass (grass vs forb) contribution to total ANPP, litter, and species richness, and mean annual water-year precipitation; and (c) whether the impacts of grazing on ANPP vary between dry and wet years.

   Methods We used long-term (14-28 years) ANPP and precipitation data from 31 grazed grasslands, each with a paired non-grazed livestock exclosure. ANPP was sampled annually within exclosures and adjacent grazed locations at each site.
   Results We found that grazing increased ANPP sensitivity to inter-annual changes in precipitation. Increased ANPP sensitivity to precipitation in grazed, relative to non-grazed locations was associated with both an increase in the contribution of forbs to total ANPP and a decrease in the contribution of grasses to total ANPP; reduced litter also increased ANPP sensitivity to precipitation. Species richness was not associated with ANPP sensitivity in both grazed and non-grazed locations. Arid grasslands were more sensitive to inter-annual variation in precipitation when grazed than were mesic grasslands. Similarly, grazing reduced ANPP during dry years but had no effect during wet years.
   Conclusions Overall, these findings suggest that grazed grasslands are more vulnerable to reductions in primary productivity in dry years, which may present a challenge for maintaining ecosystem services in an era of increasing precipitation variability.

AB  - Hybridization can result in the transfer of adaptive genetic material from one species to another, known as adaptive introgression. Bottlenecked (and hence genetically depleted) species are expected to be particularly receptive to adaptive introgression, since introgression can introduce new or previously lost adaptive genetic variation. The Alpine ibex (Capra ibex), which recently recovered from near extinction, is known to hybridize with the domestic goat (Capra aegagrus hircus), and signals of introgression previously found at the major histocompatibility complex were suggested to potentially be adaptive. Here, we combine two ancient whole genomes of Alpine ibex with 29 modern Alpine ibex genomes and 31 genomes representing six related Capra species to investigate the genome-wide patterns of introgression and confirm the potential relevance of immune loci. We identified low rates of admixture in modern Alpine ibex through various F statistics and screening for putative introgressed tracts. Further results based on demographic modelling were consistent with introgression to have occurred during the last 300 years, coinciding with the known species bottleneck, and that in each generation, 1-2 out of 100 Alpine ibex had a domestic goat parent. The putatively introgressed haplotypes were enriched at immune-related genes, where the adaptive value of alternative alleles may give individuals with otherwise depleted genetic diversity a selective advantage. While interbreeding with domestic species is a prevalent issue in species conservation, in this specific case, it resulted in putative adaptive introgression. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between hybridization, adaptive evolution, and the potential risks and benefits associated with anthropogenic influences on wild species.

AB  - Ungulate (deer) browsing threatens forest diversity and tree regeneration, but without efficient and reliable methods, we cannot monitor these impacts. Traditional methods mostly measure the size, density or growth rates of seedlings/saplings, all of which respond sensitively to local conditions, inflating variation and potential bias. The twig age method uses bud scale scars to estimate the time interval between bouts of browsing. The original method measured browse only on maples (Acer) at a single site. Here, I here extend the method using twig age data from 12 tree species distributed across 60 sites in the Upper Midwest, USA to assess its efficiency and compare how deer browse impacts vary across an exclosure fence, among species, across sites, and over time. Because deer prefer to browse on certain species, I develop and compare two methods to adjust for deer preferences to ensure accurate comparisons among sites that differ in species compositions. The twig age method is highly efficient, requiring less than an hour and minimal equipment to obtain an informative sample (90+ saplings). Exclosures confirm that twig ages respond sensitively and rapidly to deer browsing with more power than methods based on seedling/sapling size. Twig ages also covary with height under deer browsing, adding another indicator. To adjust for differential browsing among species, one can use either ratios of twig ages to an internal standard (e.g. Acer saccharum) or 2-way models to adjust for species effects when comparing sites. These approaches yield identical results. These adjusted twig age data provide a reliable and accurate way to measure differences in deer browse impacts over species, sites and time. Twig ages provide a powerful tool to sensitively track variation in local deer impacts over time and across sites and habitats. Its efficiency means forest and wildlife managers can rapidly expand deer impact monitoring programs at low cost. Applying this method broadly over successive years should soon identify adjusted twig age thresholds for predicting successful sapling recruitment and tree regeneration.

AB  - The regeneration niche of many plant species involves spatially and temporally unpredictable disturbances, called recruitment windows of opportunity. However, even species with clear dispersal adaptations such as fleshy berries may not successfully reach such elusive regeneration microsites. Ericaceous, berry-producing species in the northern hemisphere demonstrate this dispersal limitation. They are said to display a reproductive paradox owing to their lack of regeneration in apparently suitable microsites despite considerable investment in producing large quantities of berries. Cadavers generate vegetation-denuded and nutrient-rich disturbances termed cadaver decomposition islands (CDIs). Cadavers attract facultative scavengers with considerable capacity for endozoochorous seed dispersal. We hypothesize that CDIs facilitate recruitment in berry-producing ericaceous species due to endozoochorous dispersal directed toward favorable microsites with low competition. We examined seedling establishment within a permanent, semi-regular 10 x 10 m grid across an ungulate mass die-off on the Hardangervidda plateau in southeastern Norway. Competing models regarding the relative importance of factors governing recruitment were evaluated, specifically cadaver location (elevated seed rain) and microsite conditions (competition). We found that CDIs did facilitate seedling establishment, as cadaver density was the best predictor of seedling distribution. Other important factors governing seedling establishment such as percentage cover of soil and vascular plants alone were inadequate to explain seedling establishment. Synthesis: This study provides a novel understanding of sexual reproduction in species with cryptic generative reproduction. The directed nature of endozoochorous dispersal combined with long-distance dispersal abilities of medium to large vertebrate scavengers toward cadavers allows plants to exploit the advantageous but ephemeral resource provided by CDIs.

AB  - 1. Invasive species are suspected to be major contributors to biodiversity declines worldwide. Counterintuitively, however, invasive species effects are likely scale dependent and are hypothesized to be positively related to biodiversity at large spatial scales. Past studies investigating the effect of invasion on biodiversity have been mostly conducted at small scales (<100 m(2)) that cannot represent large dynamic landscapes by design. Therefore, replicated experimental evidence supporting a negative effect of invasive plants on biodiversity is lacking across many landscape types, including large grasslands.
   2. We collected data across eight large (333-809 ha) grassland landscapes managed with pyric herbivory-that is the recoupling of fire and grazing-to test how an invasive legume Lespedeza cuneata affected plant and bird communities at spatial grains ranging from 0.1 m(2) to >3,000,000 m(2).
   3. Lespedeza cuneata invasion effects on grassland plant diversity and composition changed with scale, being negative at small spatial grains (0.1 m(2)) and neutral or positive at large spatial grains (>3,000,000 m(2)).
   4. Lespedeza cuneata abundance did not significantly affect bird diversity at any spatial grain measured.
   5. Lespedeza cuneata may negatively affect biodiversity if abundances are greater than those observed in this study. However, previous research suggests that Lespedeza cuneata may not be capable of exceeding 20% canopy cover across large landscapes (>400 ha). Control and eradication strategies can be costly and are fraught with risk. If data do not clearly support a negative Lespedeza cuneata abundance-biodiversity relationship, and if invasion is spatially limited across large landscapes, ongoing control and eradication efforts may be unwarranted and ineffective.
   6. Synthesis and applications: Invasive species effects gleaned from small-scale studies may not reliably predict their effects at larger scales. Although we recognize the importance of small-scale studies in potentially isolating individual mechanisms, management strategies based solely on results from small-scale studies of invasion are unlikely to increase or conserve biodiversity across large landscapes. Rather, processes that generate landscape heterogeneity-like pyric herbivory-are probably more important for promoting biodiversity across all scales. Scale is a central problem in ecology, and defining scale in management objectives is essential for effective biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing plants such as Russian olive can significantly impact soil chemistry and invertebrate biodiversity in riparian ecosystems. Here, the effects of Russian olive on soil chemical properties and invertebrate communities in riparian zones of the southwestern United States were investigated. Russian olive stands were compared to native cottonwood stands and restoration sites by analyzing soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and moisture levels, and arthropod diversity and abundance. Sites where Russian olive is present led to a net increase in soil nitrogen, a decrease in soil phosphorus, and greater soil moisture compared to both native cottonwood stands and restoration sites. Native cottonwood stands showed lower soil N and higher P levels, as well as higher arthropod diversity. This increased diversity could be linked to the soil's nutrient stoichiometry, as there is a negative correlation between taxonomic diversity and the soil N:P ratio. Moreover, there was a greater abundance of detritivorous arthropods in Russian olive stands compared to native vegetation. Soil nitrate (NO3-) levels showed a strong positive correlation with detritivorous arthropod abundance (r2 = 0.98), but only a moderate correlation with herbivores (r2 = 0.38), and NO3- was unrelated to predator abundance (r2 = 0.01). These results suggest that Russian olive stands can alter soil chemistry in ways that disproportionately benefit detritivores, potentially disrupting the balance of arthropod communities and reducing overall biodiversity in riparian ecosystems. The study underscores the need for careful management of invasive, symbiotic N2-fixing plant species to preserve the ecological integrity of riparian habitats.

AB  - Reintroducing megafauna to their historic range is an effective strategy to halt their extinctions and restore ecosystems. Wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee) is an endangered megaherbivore that is lost from 95% of its range. About 90% of its global population (less than 4000) resides within India, in two isolated populations: northeast and central India. The central Indian population is on the verge of extinction and warrants urgent conservation interventions. We assess the potential and provide a strategy for reintroducing buffaloes in Kanha National Park, India. Habitat suitability using the global occurrence of buffalo revealed low-lying grasslands with least human pressure found in Kanha (390 km2) to be suitable. Within this suitable range, we evaluated vegetation composition, forage biomass, and potential carrying capacity. Multidimensional ordination classified these suitable sites into moist and dry grassland clusters. Moist grasslands were found to better suit reintroduction due to lower grazing pressure, higher productivity, and availability of perennial water sources. Distinct matriarchal clades of swamp and river buffalo were observed. Within the river buffalo clade, Indian wild buffaloes formed a distinct cluster with close proximity between northeast and central Indian samples, suggesting northeast buffaloes could be sourced for a founding population in Kanha. Following IUCN guidelines, we discuss the reintroduction strategy that could sustain approximately 200 buffaloes in the area and subsequently expand to other suitable habitats in central India. If implemented as proposed, recovery of this lost ecosystem engineer will help to restore grasslands, and swamp habitats, as well as contribute to its global conservation efforts.

AB  - Forests of eastern North America have been negatively impacted by excessive white-tailed deer browsing for decades. Previous studies have shown how deer-driven changes to forest structure, plant species composition, and microhabitat negatively impact forest birds. However, most experimental studies used relatively small plot sizes with few replications, limiting the transferability of findings to operational-scale timber harvests and landscape-scale management. We studied the influence of white-tailed deer browsing on breeding bird communities in ten pairs of operational-sized fenced and unfenced regeneration timber harvests in northcentral Pennsylvania. Based on a previous study that examined correlations between bird and deer abundance in Pennsylvania, we developed species-specific predictions about how density would vary between fenced and unfenced harvests. We predicted six species would show a negative response to deer and three would show a neutral response. Overall, diversity and composition of breeding bird communities did not differ between fenced and unfenced harvests. However, four species showed a negative response to deer, four showed a neutral response to deer, and one showed a positive response to deer. Thus, six of nine focal species aligned with our predictions: negative (n = 4) and neutral (n = 2). Densities of two remaining focal species were associated with vegetative features that also were consistent with our predictions. Our final focal species showed a strong positive association with unfenced harvests, contrary to our prediction. Our findings demonstrate that deer-induced impacts on vegetation in operational-scale timber harvests can have considerable influence on densities of some avian species. We conclude that the use of deer-exclusion fencing after timber harvests is an effective and sometimes necessary management tool to achieve maximum forestry and wildlife benefits.

AB  - Grassland bird responses to grazing and prescribed fire are species-specific and are primarily known from systems with cattle as the predominant grazer. There is less knowledge of how grazing by bison impacts grassland birds, especially in sites restored and reconstructed from row-crop agriculture. Working at a tallgrass prairie site consisting of restored and remnant prairie in the years following bison reintroduction and ongoing prescribed burning, we assessed overall species richness and the relative detection frequency of five focal species (Grasshopper Sparrow, Henslow's Sparrow, Dickcissel, Eastern Meadowlark, and Brown-headed Cowbird). We used stationary bioacoustics recorders to record the soundscape during the summer breeding season in areas with and without bison from 2016 to 2018. Species richness and the detection frequencies of our focal species were not influenced by bison disturbance. Grasshopper Sparrow and Dickcissel detection frequency increased slightly in response to prescribed fire, whereas Henslow's Sparrow detection frequency decreased. Time since sites were restored was a predominant factor that influenced the variation in detection frequency of Henslow's Sparrows and Eastern Meadowlarks, likely due to vegetation differences in restored versus remnant sites and each species' vegetation structure preferences. Brown-headed Cowbird detection frequency was unaffected by bison presence, prescribed fire, or time since restoration, but varied among sampling years. Our focal species showed no response to bison disturbance 4 y after the bison reintroduction. This suggests there could be a time-lag for a response or that these species will not respond to the bison reintroduction at this study site.

AB  - Non-native crayfish are among the most widespread aquatic invasive species worldwide. High densities of crayfish in lakes can potentially cause complete loss of macrophytes through herbivory, physical destruction, shading by suspension of sediments and nutrient release facilitating phytoplankton, thus altering ecosystem state and functions. However, lower crayfish densities may affect different macrophyte species in different ways, thus altering competition between macrophyte species with different growth forms. We hypothesize that high crayfish densities can completely destroy submerged macrophyte communities and shift systems into more turbid conditions whereas low crayfish densities can promote low-growing macrophytes that compete with canopy-forming species. To test these hypotheses, we applied three different densities (2, 4, 8 crayfish m-2) of the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii and a control (no crayfish) to 36 mesocosms of monocultures and mixed stands of low-growing and canopy-forming submerged macrophytes for 60 days. We measured concentrations of nutrients, suspended solids, phytoplankton and periphyton and above- and belowground biomass of low-growing Vallisneria natans and canopy-forming Hydrilla verticillata. In addition, we conducted a meta-analysis of crayfish impacts on macrophytes to compare effect sizes between different crayfish densities. Using data from published studies, we derived the relationship between crayfish density and crayfish-induced reductions in macrophyte abundance. Our meta-analysis revealed a significant decline of macrophytes with increasing crayfish densities. In line with existing studies, high crayfish densities caused a strong loss of both low-growing and canopy-forming macrophytes and increased nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton biomass and suspended sediment, thus favouring an ecosystem shift to more turbid conditions. Low and medium crayfish densities reduced macrophyte biomass similarly for both species in monocultures. However, in mixed cultures, low crayfish densities (2 crayfish m-2) reduced the above- and belowground biomass of the canopy-forming H. verticillata more than that of low-growing V. natans, supporting our hypothesis. This support of low-growing macrophytes occurred despite a temporal facilitation of shading by increased periphyton biomass. Our results show that the impact of crayfish invasions on aquatic ecosystems is strongly dependent on their density. High densities facilitate the loss of macrophytes and increase the likelihood of ecosystem collapse into a turbid state. However, low densities can provide a competitive advantage to low-growing macrophytes that would otherwise be outcompeted by canopy-forming species. Although complete eradication is often impossible, management of invasive crayfish can target densities that have potentially positive effects on invaded ecosystems.

AB  - Large wild herbivores are important and natural components of forest ecosystems, but through their browsing activities have the potential to influence the structure and composition of forest communities, thus timber production and ecosystem dynamics. To examine the effects of browsing by wild herbivores on a young post-disturbance forest in the Kysuce region of northwestern Slovakia, we established two sets of 2 m radius plots, 15 within a fenced area (5.12 ha) that excluded large wild herbivores, and 15 within an adjacent unfenced area. In each plot, we recorded the species, tree height, stem base diameter, and mutual geographic positions of trees. When we compared tree community characteristics between the unfenced and fenced plots, we found fewer and smaller broadleaved tree species, except silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) in the unfenced plots. Although common rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.) was the dominant species within fenced plots, where some individuals were over 6.0 m tall, this species was rare outside the fenced area and usually did not exceed 1.5 m. In contrast, Norway spruce (Picea abies Karts L.) was more abundant and taller within the unfenced area, likely released from competition by suppression of broadleaved trees by herbivores. In addition, fenced plots also showed twice the tree species richness (Shannon index) of unfenced ones. Despite changes in tree communities, total aboveground biomass stock was only slightly but significantly lower in the unfenced than the fenced plots (29.6 kg per 10 m(2) vs. 33.5 kg per 10 m(2)). Our study suggested that browsing pressure by large wild herbivores that focused on most broadleaved trees weakened interspecies competition and allowed the expansion of Norway spruce. As a consequence, converting spruce monocultures to mixed species stands is likely unrealistic when faced with heavy browsing pressure by wild large herbivores.

AB  - Climate warming is severely affecting high-latitude regions. In the Arctic tundra, it may lead to enhanced soil nutrient availability and interact with simultaneous changes in grazing pressure. It is presently unknown how these concurrently occurring global change drivers affect the root-associated fungal communities, particularly mycorrhizal fungi, and whether changes coincide with shifts in plant mycorrhizal types. We investigated changes in root-associated fungal communities and mycorrhizal types of the plant community in a 10-yr factorial experiment with warming, fertilisation and grazing exclusion in a Finnish tundra grassland. The strongest determinant of the root-associated fungal community was fertilisation, which consistently increased potential plant pathogen abundance and had contrasting effects on the different mycorrhizal fungal types, contingent on other treatments. Plant mycorrhizal types went through pronounced shifts, with warming favouring ecto- and ericoid mycorrhiza but not under fertilisation and grazing exclusion. Combination of all treatments resulted in dominance by arbuscular mycorrhizal plants. However, shifts in plant mycorrhizal types vs fungi were mostly but not always aligned in their magnitude and direction. Our results show that our ability to predict shifts in symbiotic and antagonistic fungal communities depend on simultaneous consideration of multiple global change factors that jointly alter plant and fungal communities.

AB  - IntroductionLivestock overgrazing represents one of the most destructive uses of land in terrestrial ecosystems and threatens biodiversity. However, understanding the effects of livestock overgrazing on below-ground soil microbial diversity is limited, despite soil microbes representing the majority of biodiversity and determining ecosystem functioning.Materials and MethodsTo investigate the effects of overgrazing on soil microbial richness, a long-term grazing exclusion experiment was conducted at six sites including three meadow steppes and three typical steppes in northern China.ResultsOur results revealed that overgrazing decreased bacterial and fungal richness across temperate steppes in northern China, and the biome could regulate the overgrazing effects, especially for fungal richness. Specifically, the negative effects of overgrazing on microbial richness were highly significant in typical steppes while not significant in meadow steppes that contained higher plant diversity and precipitation. Partial least-squares path model showed that overgrazing affected soil microbial richness in highly complex ways, and the affected pathways were different in meadow steppes and typical steppes. The direct negative effects of grazing and their indirect negative effects via soil properties resulted in a significant decrease in microbial richness in typical steppes. In meadow steppes, the indirect beneficial effects via plant attributes offset the direct negative effects of grazing. Consequently, the soil microbial community in meadow steppe resisted overgrazing disturbance.ConclusionOur study illuminates the complex and highly biome-dependent grazing effects and pathways on soil microbiota and indicates that meadow steppe may be more resistant or resilient to human disturbance than typical steppe. These findings suggest that different grasslands might be managed differently considering their intrinsic characteristics to help biodiversity conservation. Moreover, future research should focus on the underlying mechanisms of grazing effects on soil microbial richness. Besides grazing-induced plant and soil traits changes, other potential pathways could strongly influence soil microbial diversity.

AB  - Herbivore grazing is an important determinant of plant community assemblages. Thus, it is essential to understand its impact to direct conservation efforts in regions where herbivores are managed. While the impacts of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) grazing on plant biodiversity and community composition in the Fennoscandian tundra are well studied, the impact of reindeer grazing on phylogenetic community structure is not. We used data from a multiyear quasi-experimental study in northern Fennoscandia to analyze the effect of reindeer grazing on plant community diversity including its phylogenetic structure. Our study design used a permanent fence constructed in the 1960s and temporary fences constructed along the permanent fence to expose plant communities to three different grazing regimes: light (almost never grazed), pulse (grazed every other year), and press (chronic grazing for over 40 years). Similar to previous studies on low productivity ecosystems in this region, the species richness and evenness of plant communities with pulse and press grazing did not differ from communities with light grazing. Also consistent with previous studies in this region, we observed a transition from shrub-dominated communities with light grazing to graminoid-dominated communities with pulse and press grazing. Interestingly, communities with pulse, but not press, grazing were more phylogenetically dispersed than communities with light grazing. If grazing pulses can increase the phylogenetic diversity of plant communities, our result suggests changes in reindeer management allowing for pulses of grazing to increase phylogenetic diversity of plant communities.

AB  - Understanding whether invasive and native species compete for shared resources where they co-occur is essential for mitigating the negative impacts of invasive species on native ecosystems. Here, we examined how the presence and density of an invasive species, wild pigs (Sus scrofa), affect native white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter, deer) on the Savannah River Site, SC, USA. We examined potential changes in deer areas of use, temporal overlap, and occupancy to evaluate the effects of wild pig occurrence and density on deer space use, diel activity, and co-occurrence with wild pigs across 9 months during 2018 and 2019. Wild pig density had the strongest effect on deer space use in high- and moderate-use areas. Declines in deer space use in response to wild pig density were most pronounced in March and October 2018 and April 2019 for females, while male space use declined in response to wild pig density in October and December 2018. Both species were largely nocturnal with high overlap in diel activity across months. Deer occupancy responses to wild pig density varied across months, with negative responses in May and October 2018 and positive responses in July 2018 and April 2019. Deer and wild pigs co-occurred at 30%-59% of camera stations across months, with broadscale co-occurrence patterns being unaffected by changes in shared cover or wild pig occurrence. Overall, our results suggest that deer make fine-scale behavioral adjustments to avoid wild pigs, providing evidence that competition is likely occurring even where wild pig density is relatively low. Such fine-scale behavioral plasticity in deer appears to mitigate the costs of competition with wild pigs and may be a mechanism enabling long-term co-existence of deer and wild pigs. Our study provides novel insight on the complexities of spatiotemporal relationships between invasive wild pigs and native deer and suggests that the negative effects of interactions between deer and wild pigs may be more pronounced when deer life history needs are particularly demanding. In areas where eradication of invasive wild pigs may be impossible, maintaining low wild pig densities may help mitigate, but may not eliminate, the negative effects of wild pigs on deer.

AB  - Woody-plant encroachment is a global phenomenon that has been affecting the southwestern United States since the late 1800s. Drought, overgrazing, herbivory, and competition between grasses and shrub seedlings have been hypothesized as the main drivers of shrub establishment. However, there is limited knowledge about the interactions among these drivers. Using a rainfall manipulation system and various herbivore exclosures, we tested hypotheses about how precipitation (PPT), competition between grasses and shrub seedlings, and predation affect the germination and first-year survival of mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), a shrub that has encroached in Southern Great Plains and Chihuahuan Desert grasslands. We found that mesquite germination and survival (1) increased with increasing PPT, then saturated at about the mean growing season PPT level, (2) that competition between grasses and shrub seedlings had no effect on either germination or survival, and (3) that herbivory by small mammals decreased seedling establishment and survival, while ant granivory showed no effect. In addition to its direct positive effect on survival, PPT had an indirect negative effect via increasing small mammal activity. Current models predict a decrease in PPT in the southwestern United States with increased frequency of extreme events. The non-linear nature of PPT effects on Mesquite recruitment suggests asymmetric responses, wherein drought has a relatively greater negative effect than the positive effect of wet years. Indirect effects of PPT, through its effects on small mammal abundance, highlight the importance of accounting for interactions between biotic and abiotic drivers of shrub encroachment. This study provides quantitative basis for developing tools that can inform effective shrub management strategies in grasslands and savannas.

AB  - 1. Whether wild herbivores confer biotic resistance to invasion by exotic plants remains a key question in ecology. There is evidence that wild herbivores can impede invasion by exotic plants, but it is unclear whether and how this generalises across ecosystems with varying wild herbivore diversity and functional groups of plants, particularly over long-term (decadal) time frames.
   2. Using data from three long-term (13- to 26-year) exclosure experiments in central Kenya, we tested the effects of wild herbivores on the density of exotic invasive cacti, Opuntia stricta and O. ficus-indica (collectively, Opuntia), which are among the worst invasive species globally. We also examined relationships between wild herbivore richness and elephant occurrence probability with the probability of O. stricta presence at the landscape level (6150 km(2)).
   3. Opuntia densities were 74% to 99% lower in almost all plots accessible to wild herbivores compared to exclosure plots. Opuntia densities also increased more rapidly across time in plots excluding wild herbivores. These effects were largely driven by megaherbivores (>= 1000 kg), particularly elephants.
   4. At the landscape level, modelled Opuntia stricta occurrence probability was negatively correlated with estimated species richness of wild herbivores and elephant occurrence probability. On average, O. stricta occurrence probability fell from similar to 0.56 to similar to 0.45 as wild herbivore richness increased from 6 to 10 species and fell from similar to 0.57 to similar to 0.40 as elephant occurrence probability increased from similar to 0.41 to similar to 0.84. These multi-scale results suggest that any facilitative effects of Opuntia by wild herbivores (e.g. seed/vegetative dispersal) are overridden by suppression (e.g. consumption, uprooting, trampling).
   5. Synthesis. Our experimental and observational findings that wild herbivores confer resistance to invasion by exotic cacti add to evidence that conserving and restoring native herbivore assemblages (particularly megaherbivores) can increase community resistance to plant invasions.

AB  - This field study in a semi-arid savannah at Senkelle Swayne's Hartebeest Sanctuary, Ethiopia, examined livestock grazing effects on rangeland condition, plant species composition and richness, and population of the endangered Swayne's hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus swaynei). Rangeland condition was analysed using a common protocol for the assessment of semi-arid rangelands. A total count method was used to estimate ungulate numbers. Grazing reduced all measures of range condition and productivity and affected the composition and richness of the herbaceous species. Grazing also induced an increase in the density and number of encroaching woody species Vachellia seyal and Senegalia senegal. The population of the Swayne's hartebeest significantly affected by livestock grazing (mean number of hartebeests observed under moderately and lightly grazed sites were 10.00 +/- 2.49 and 6.75 +/- 2.06, respectively). No individual hartebeest was observed roaming in the heavily grazed zone, which implies an effective reduction in the extent of habitat available for the hartebeest. The overall condition of the rangeland was poor. Measures to reduce livestock presence in areas from which the hartebeest has been displaced and controlled seasonal livestock grazing within non-sensitive parts of the Sanctuary may benefit the hartebeest. Coupled with these, livestock exclusions for up to a year and interseeding may help improve rangeland condition and hartebeest's habitat.

AB  - Livestock grazing is a globally important land use and has the potential to significantly influence plant community structure and ecosystem function, yet several critical knowledge gaps remain on the direction and magnitude of grazing impacts. Furthermore, much of our understanding of the long-term effects on plant community composition and structure are based on grazer exclusion experiments, which explicitly avoid characterizing effects along grazing intensity gradients. We sampled big sagebrush plant communities using 68 plots located along grazing intensity gradients to determine how grazing intensity influences multiple aspects of plant community structure over time. This was accomplished by sampling plant communities at different distances from 17 artificial watering sources, using distance from water and cow dung density as proxies for grazing intensity at individual plots. Total vegetation cover and total grass cover were negatively related to grazing intensity, and cover of annual forbs, exotic cover, and exotic richness were positively related to grazing intensity. In contrast, species richness and composition, bunchgrass biomass, shrub density and size, percentage cover of bare ground, litter, and biological soil crusts did not vary along our grazing intensity gradients, in spite of our expectations to the contrary. Our results suggest that the effects of livestock grazing over multiple decades (mean = 46 years) in our sites are relatively small, especially for native perennial species, and that the big sagebrush plant communities we sampled are somewhat resistant to livestock grazing. Collectively, our findings are consistent with existing evidence that indicates the stability of the big sagebrush plant functional type composition under current grazing management regimes.

AB  - The simplification of forest structural complexity, caused by anthropogenic land-use practices, is one of the main threats to understory specialist birds. We examined the association of both single structural attributes and structural complexity, with the density of 4 understory bird species in the Global Biodiversity Hotspot '' Chilean Winter Rainfall-Valdivian Forests '' of South America. Between 2011 and 2013, we surveyed habitat attributes and conducted bird point counts in 505 plots in Andean temperate ecosystems in Chile. In each habitat plot, we measured understory density, volume of coarse woody debris (CWD), number of snags, diameter at breast height (DBH) of trees, and leaf litter depth. With these attributes, we developed an index of stand structural complexity (ISC). On average, old-growth forests had higher values for understory density, CWD volume, DBH, and litter depth than secondary forests and open fields, and thus greater values of ISC. The density of understory birds was positively correlated with the ISC for the Rhinocryptidae Pteroptochos tarnii, Scelorchilus rubecula, and Scytalopus magellanicus. We also found a positive association between understory density and litter depth, with the density of the Furnariidae Sylviorthorhynchus desmursii. However, this latter species showed a negative association with the density of snags. Our results suggest the utility of using an index of structural complexity, rather than single or even additive habitat attributes, for determining the density of understory specialist birds. We recommend that management plans should promote the retention of habitat attributes that contribute to the structural complexity of temperate forests of South America and beyond.

AB  - In Europe, over a third of the agricultural area is grass meadows used for livestock grazing and fodder production. Grass meadows provide a food source for wild ungulates causing human-wildlife conflicts due to forage removal. Few experimental studies have quantified biomass loss with enough replicates to determine how surrounding environments influences level of biomass removal. Using an exclosure experiment on 57 grassland meadows over five years at the northwest coast of Norway covering 10 650 km2, we quantified biomass removal by red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) and how environmental factors impacted biomass loss (Study 1). Furthermore, we examined development of biomass loss and crude protein concentration in five fields throughout the growing season (Study 2). The average predicted biomass loss to red deer grazing was 16% for the first harvest, and 7.3% for the second harvest (Study 1). Biomass loss increased with red deer density from 0% at the lowest density (0.6 red deer harvested/km2) to 31% at the highest density (4 red deer harvested/km2). Biomass loss increased from 12% to 32.8% as terrain ruggedness index (TRI) rose from 2.1 to 7.1. Absolute biomass loss increased towards time of grass harvest (Study 2). Crude protein concentration was higher in unfenced plots during the period before first harvest, but not between first and second harvest (Study 2). The quantification of biomass removal at a large spatial scale over several years in this study provides a better understanding of factors causing variation in losses.

AB  - Biodiversity loss and vast forest diebacks due to climate change-induced disturbances require adapted forest management strategies that reconcile economic interests and conservation. Tree species selection, including admixture of fast-growing and drought-tolerant non-native species to native forests, is an increasingly considered approach. However, we lack data on how such mixtures affect native forest biodiversity, especially for the sparsely researched major above-ground part of trees, the canopy. In 40 temperate forest plots in northwest Germany, we investigated how monocultures and admixtures of introduced fast-growing conifers (native Norway spruce planted outside its natural range and non-native Douglas fir) to native broadleaved European beech forests affect abundance, biomass, taxonomic and functional diversity and community composition of canopy beetles across trophic guilds. Diverse arthropod communities are vital contributors to forest health and resilience, and therefore valuable indicators to assess and evaluate forestry measures. Monospecific stands of non-native Douglas fir reduced canopy beetle abundance and diversity compared to native European beech, exceeding the negative effects of Norway spruce. These effects were more pronounced for herbivorous beetles, while they were less strong for predators. Beetle communities in monospecific Norway spruce stands had low functional richness. European beech and mixtures with non-native Douglas fir had high dissimilarity between local communities (turnover, i.e. beta diversity) and high total beetle diversity at landscape scale (gamma diversity). Mixtures generally mitigated the negative effects of introduced conifers, including shifts in species community composition compared to native European beech. Synthesis and applications: Monospecific stands of fast-growing non-native Douglas fir and native Norway spruce planted outside its natural occurrence showed undesirable effects such as low diversity and a shifted community composition of canopy beetles compared to native European beech. However, mixed stands mitigated negative effects and specifically admixed non-native Douglas fir did not reduce species turnover and landscape-scale beetle diversity. In line with recent studies on other forest taxa, we conclude that admixtures of introduced conifers to European beech forests, but not monospecific plantations, can potentially serve as a compromise between conservational and economic interests.

In line with recent studies on other forest taxa, we conclude that admixtures of introduced conifers to European beech forests, but not monospecific plantations, can potentially serve as a compromise between conservational and economic interests.image

AB  - Although livestock have been historically associated with land conversion and biodiversity loss, well-managed cattle grazing has been reported to contribute to conservation of open ecosystems. Knowing the balance between positive and negative effects of livestock (presence or exclusion) on different ecosystems is, therefore, crucial to support management decisions. We conducted an experiment in a secondary savanna with exotic grasses, used as pasture, to assess the effect of cattle presence in low density and cattle exclusion (in paired plots) on the trajectory of these ecosystems. Richness, composition and structure of the woody community, and exotic grass cover and biomass were compared between treatments in the beginning of the experiment and after 7 years. At the end of the experiment, we also compared composition, richness, and density of the native ground layer. We verified that (a) cattle exclusion accelerates the undesirable woody encroachment, changes the species composition and leads to huge grass fuel accumulation, while (b) cattle grazing/browsing hinders changes in savanna structure and composition and reduces the exotic grass cover and biomass, thus favoring native herbaceous plants. By decreasing the grass biomass, cattle grazing also reduces the system flammability and, therefore, the risk and intensity of wildfires. Together, the positive effects of cattle presence and the negative effects of cattle exclusion lead to the conclusion that cattle should be maintained in these systems. Low-intensity cattle grazing limits woody and exotic grass invasion, improves native forb biodiversity, and help to maintain composition and structural features of secondary savannas of the Cerrado.

AB  - Interactions between species influence ecosystem functions and are sensitive to reintroductions. Our understanding of interactions between naturally co-occurring large herbivores, such as Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) that are now re-establishing throughout their range, and well-established native ungulates, is limited, despite the potential implications for riparian woodlands. Observations in Scotland indicate that roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) readily exploit the regenerative secondary shoots produced after tree felling by beaver. Our study, based in eastern Scotland, investigates the role of beaver herbivory in riparian woodland regeneration and asks whether deer are attracted to this novel resource because it is either a) more readily available, b) nutritionally superior, or c) morphologically more appealing than accessible browse on unfelled (standing) trees. We firstly quantified the secondary shoots available to browsing deer at different heights on felled and standing birch (Betula spp.) trees in twenty riparian woodland plots across five well-established beaver territories (occupancy ten years). Shoots from birch and willow (Salix spp.) trees with contrasting levels and combinations of beaver and deer browsing were then analysed for nutritional content (nitrogen and carbon) and morphological characteristics (number of buds and lateral branches). We found that 62% of beaver-felled trees produced secondary shoots available to browsing deer. Compared to standing trees, regenerating beaver-felled trees had 18% more secondary shoots. These shoots were significantly higher in nitrogen content (+13%), but similar in carbon content and concentrated closer to the ground. Our results show that beaver herbivory can promote riparian woodland regeneration and heterogeneity by creating a mosaic of mature and multi-stemmed coppiced trees. The addition of a common, readily available, and nutritious resource through beaver browsing could, however, also enhance habitat quality for browsing deer, with the potential to affect deer distribution and feeding habits.

AB  - In the midst of an ongoing biodiversity crisis, much research has focused on species losses and their impacts on ecosystem functioning. The functional consequences (ecosystem response) of shifts in communities are shaped not only by changes in species richness, but also by compositional shifts that result from species losses and gains. Species differ in their contribution to ecosystem functioning, so species identity underlies the consequences of species losses and gains on ecosystem functions. Such research is critical to better predict the impact of disturbances on communities and ecosystems. We used the "Community Assembly and the Functioning of Ecosystems" (CAFE) approach, a modification of the Price equation to understand the functional consequences and relative effects of richness and composition changes in small nonvolant mammal and dung beetle communities as a result of two common disturbances in North American prairie restorations, prescribed fire and the reintroduction of large grazing mammals. Previous research in this system has shown dung beetles are critically important decomposers, while small mammals modulate much energy in prairie food webs. We found that dung beetle communities were more responsive to bison reintroduction and prescribed fires than small nonvolant mammals. Dung beetle richness increased after bison reintroduction, with higher dung beetle community biomass resulting from changes in remaining species (context-dependent component) rather than species turnover (richness components); prescribed fire caused a minor increase in dung beetle biomass for the same reason. For small mammals, bison reintroduction reduced energy transfer through the loss of species, while prescribed fire had little impact on either small mammal richness or energy transfer. The CAFE approach demonstrates how bison reintroduction controls small nonvolant mammal communities by increasing prairie food web complexity, and increases dung beetle populations with possible benefits for soil health through dung mineralization and soil bioturbation. Prescribed fires, however, have little effect on small mammals and dung beetles, suggesting a resilience to fire. These findings illustrate the key role of re-establishing historical disturbance regimes when restoring endangered prairie ecosystems and their ecological function.

AB  - Aim: The effects of insectivorous predators on herbivorous prey should have a cascading effect releasing herbivory pressure and favouring plant's biomass. However, it remains unclear whether different types of predators regulate herbivores to the same degree across seasons, and how their interactions affect lower trophic levels across elevations where predator communities differ significantly. Therefore, we investigated the impact of excluding flying vertebrate predators and ants (individually and in combination) on arthropods and herbivory across tropical seasons along a rainforest gradient spanning 3500 m a.s.l.
   Location: Papua New Guinea.
   Taxon: Multi-taxon.
   Methods: We excluded predators from 560 saplings in two 6-month-long predator exclusion experiments, controlling for seasonality. Saplings were spread across eight sites, evenly spaced at 500 m elevational increments from 200 to 3700 m a.s.l. We measured change in the abundance of arthropods and herbivory damage and analysed them by linear and generalized linear mixed models.
   Results: Exclusion of flying vertebrate predators, but not ants, led to a significant increase in both arthropod density and herbivory damage. The density of arthropods increased significantly by 37% when flying vertebrates were excluded and by 33% when both flying vertebrates and ants were excluded. Both season and elevation significantly influenced this effect. Leaf damage increased significantly by 50% in exclosures of flying vertebrates alone and by 36% in combined exclosures of flying vertebrates and ants. In contrast, the exclusion of ants alone had no significant effect on arthropod density or leaf damage, which increased by 12% and 9%, respectively, although the effect decreased with increasing elevation.
   Main conclusions: The overall effect of flying vertebrate predators on arthropod density and leaf damage remains consistently strong along the whole elevational gradient. In contrast, ant-driven trophic cascades were detected only in lowland. Disappearance of insectivorous flying vertebrates could lead to substantial negative consequences for plants.

AB  - In fragmented forests, many factors can affect plant community establishment, including abiotic factors, below-ground root competition, aboveground seed predation, and seedling herbivory. Little is known about the relative effects of biotic and abiotic factors affecting the initial stage of seedling establishment: seed gemmation and early seedling survival. Here, we carried out a root competition exclusion experiment and a herbivory (including seed predation) exclusion experiment on 11 islands in Thousand Island Lake, China, using four native woody plant species that differed in functional traits (e.g., seed mass and dominance). The dominant species on islands showed the highest seedling survival, and there was no significant linear relationship between the proportion of surviving seedlings and island area under either treatment for any species. Compared to the control and excluding root competition treatments, excluding seed predation and herbivory significantly increased seedling survival after controlling for the environmental factors. However, abiotic factors had no effect on early seedling establishment. Our results suggest that seedling regeneration of rare species in fragmented ecosystems may be limited and that seedlings may be more susceptible to predators and herbivores in fragmented ecosystems. These results have significant implications for the conservation of plant diversity in fragmented forests.

AB  - An understanding of how terrestrial mammalian predators use their environment is critical for the development of effective management and monitoring. Mammalian predators often use anthropogenic linear features-such as roads, fencelines, and infrastructure corridors-to increase movement efficiency and prey encounter rates. However, there has been little investigation into how predators use more subtle linear features such as game trails (i.e., well-trodden paths created by megaherbivores). This is despite native and exotic megaherbivores being abundant across many of Earth's most intact landscapes and conservation areas. We investigated how the two largest terrestrial mammalian predators in northern Australian savannas-the dingo (Canis familiaris, introduced ca. 4000 years ago) and cat (Felis catus, introduced ca. 200 years ago)-use game trails created by exotic megaherbivores (Asian water buffalo Bubalus bubalis and horse Equus caballus). We deployed two camera traps at 52 sites, with one camera positioned on a game trail and another in undisturbed vegetation < 60 m away. We compared the activity of predators on game trails to adjacent undisturbed vegetation and explored how trail use varied with vegetation structure and prey activity. Dingoes and cats were 34 times and 6 times more likely to be detected on game trails than in adjacent vegetation, respectively, suggesting these predators preferentially use game trails. We speculate that the extensive network of game trails created by exotic megaherbivores across northern Australia's vast savannas has potentially facilitated terrestrial mammalian predator movement at very large scales. Controlling exotic megaherbivores may, therefore, provide a means of disrupting the activity of dingoes and cats, thereby benefiting predation-susceptible native species. However, further research is needed to understand the ecological implications of game trails in Australian savannas and other habitat types.

AB  - Deer, both native and non-native, can damage forest ecosystems when occurring at high densities, impacting biodiversity and ecological functioning at multiple levels. The ecological drivers of forest damage and the roles of single and multiple co-occurring deer species are not well understood due to a scarcity of simultaneous high resolution multi-species deer distribution and forest damage data. Here, we aimed to disentangle the relationship between forest damage, forest characteristics and the roles deer play in damaging forest ecosystems. To achieve this, we integrated novel high resolution deer distribution data for multiple deer species (native and non-native) with forest inventory data collected in 1,681 sampling stations across Ireland to (i) understand environmental drivers of damage, and (ii) demonstrate the utility of this approach in providing predicted damage scenarios based on the relative abundance of different co-occurring deer species. We found that forest characteristics played a key role in the severity and type of damage risk that deer posed. All damage types were more prevalent in forests with greater tree densities where deer are more likely to find refuge from human disturbance. Bark stripping damage was more prevalent in mature forests with high tree diversity and ground level flora (e.g., bryophytes, herbs, and shrubs). Similarly, browsing damage was more prevalent in forests with greater tree richness but with understorey vegetation dominated by grass and ferns. Fraying damage was more common in mixed woodlands with understories dominated by bryophytes and grass. Crucially, we found that type and severity of forest damage were shaped by the interaction of multiple deer species occurring simultaneously, particularly at high densities, suggesting subtle inter-species competition and exclusion/partition dynamics that require further investigation to understand the ecological mechanism. Finally, we developed predicted damage scenarios to precisely predict where damage is likely to occur based on relative densities of two co-occurring deer species. We predicted high levels of damage in sika and/or red deer hotspots, matching areas of highly concentrated deer distributions. Our study highlights the ecological drivers of deer -caused forest damage, the role that co-occurring native and non-native deer species may play on forest damage within a large spatial scale and describes an approach that can be replicated in other countries with similar datasets. By combining reliable species distribution models with the national forest inventory data, we can now provide a useful tool for practitioners to help alleviate and mitigate forest damage and human wildlife conflicts.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are crucial habitats for waterbirds, and saltmarsh vegetation provides breeding habitats for bird species. However, studies on the effects of saltmarsh vegetation degradation and reconstruction on bird diversity are limited. In Dafeng Milu National Nature Reserve, a Ramsar wetland, the reintroduced Pe`re David's deer, Elaphurus davidianus, severely degrades native vegetation. Thus, the natural reserve has implemented vegetation restoration through artificial planting to promote the growth of native flora. To elucidate the impact of active vegetation restoration on the avian community, we conducted bird surveys in active restoration areas and nonintervention areas during the breeding seasons from 2022 to 2023. The results indicated that there was no significant difference in the species diversity of bird communities between the active restoration areas and the nonintervention areas; however, there were significant differences in the functional and phylogenetic diversity of bird communities. Landscape analysis based on indices and correlation testing revealed a significant correlation between habitat heterogeneity at the landscape level and the functional diversity of bird communities. A random forest model identifies landscape area and cohesion as important influencing factors. Our results highlight that in the context of plant degradation caused by Pe`re David's deer in coastal wetlands, active vegetation restoration and the control of deer populations are conducive to enhancing avian diversity.

AB  - Management of feral animals can be complicated by conflicting economic, social, cultural and political values of stakeholders. To visually demonstrate the ecological impacts of feral ungulates, natural resource managers often construct exclusion fences; however, lessons are not often widely shared in the scientific literature and Indigenous insights are rarely recorded. Here, we report on long-term (7-11 years) feral buffalo and pig exclusion fences that were constructed by the Yirralka Rangers in ephemeral coastal wetlands of the Laynhapuy Indigenous Protected Area, northern Australia. Elevation transects across fence boundaries suggested that feral ungulates may be eroding floodplains and therefore reducing elevation. Comparisons of intermittent photos and contemporary inside-outside fence floristic assessments suggested that feral ungulates have an obvious and significant effect on vegetation cover and composition which may also inhibit natural soil accretion. Interviews with senior Indigenous knowledge holders revealed that feral ungulate culling was broadly supported due to impacts on cultural and spiritual values. Synthesis of the results suggested that feral ungulates are having substantial impacts on the cultural use, flora and soil stabilisation of coastal wetlands. Further research on soil erosion and accretion in places with and without ungulates will elucidate the effects of ungulates on potential sea-level rise resilience of coastal wetlands. This paper highlights the benefits of cross-cultural and collaborative multi-disciplinary research such as producing holistic outcomes relevant to stakeholders that can inform management decisions.

AB  - Whether environmental conditions under exotic tree plantations abandoned in the Western Ghats of India can facilitate the natural regeneration of tropical montane forest (Shola forest) tree species is being debated. In many cases, the exotic tree plantations are being cleared to allow for the restoration of native ecosystems. In this paper, we examined whether exotic tree plantations have indeed a negative effect on the regeneration of Shola forest tree species. For this, we assessed the abundance, diversity, and composition of the regeneration of Shola forest tree species in plantations, each with different dominant tree species (Acacia mearnsii, Pinus sp., and Eucalyptus sp.). We tested the abundance of regenerating native tree species against the main plantation canopy species (plantation type) as well as other environmental factors (aspect, distance to nearest Shola forest, structural diversity, slope, elevation, presence of herbivores, and canopy closure). We found that the number of native tree species regenerating in all plantation types was at an acceptable level: 1960, 1773, and 462 individuals ha-1 for Acacia, Eucalyptus, and Pinus plantations, respectively. A rare fraction analysis showed that the highest number of Shola tree species were regenerating under Acacia mearnsii (25) followed by Eucalyptus (19) and Pinus (8) plantations. The density and diversity of regenerating Shola trees was greatest under Acacia plantations and northern aspects but declined with increasing elevation. The presence of herbivores also reduced the density and diversity of Shola tree regeneration. We concluded that the restoration of Shola forest in the Western Ghats is possible in existing stands of exotic tree species and this process can be accelerated with appropriate silvicultural methods. We additionally recommend that studies involving long-term exclosures can provide valuable insights into the effects of browsing on regeneration and species composition.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is associated with decreased species diversity. However, the effects of fragmentation on the processes that maintain diversity, such as enemy-mediated negative conspecific density dependence (CDD), are largely unknown. We examined how negative CDD in seedling survival is influenced by habitat fragmentation. We measured the effect of conspecific density on seedling survival of 30 species for 10 years on 25 islands in an artificially fragmented habitat and took parallel measurements of the potential drivers: soil physical and chemical properties, and insect herbivore communities. Increasing densities of conspecific trees and seedlings reduced seedling survival more on larger and more isolated islands. These processes were linked to increases in insect herbivore richness on larger islands, and less fertile soils on more isolated islands. Synthesis. Our results indicate that shifts in the abiotic and biotic conditions of fragmented habitats can modify the mechanisms thought to maintain species coexistence, perhaps contributing to the long-term decay of fragmented ecosystems, and suggesting approaches for restoration. The relationships between island configuration, and insect herbivore communities and soil properties may vary among ecosystems, which could help explain variation among studies in the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity.

AB  - Endemic island plant species under threat due to anthropogenic activities may be more susceptible to decline than their indigenous counterparts. Our study aimed to determine whether endemic and indigenous plant cover in Hawaiian forests have been differentially affected by resource availability, disturbance, and invasion over time. We resurveyed 25 plots (400 m(2) each) across gradients of elevation, precipitation, slope, and understory light availability in forested conservation areas on the island of O'ahu, Hawai'i, USA. We assessed how these abiotic factors relate to absolute cover (previous, current, and change over time) of endemic and indigenous Hawaiian plants, as well as that of non-native species. Endemic species had a net loss of cover (-45%) since previous surveys 27 to 45 years earlier, while indigenous species had a net gain (+ 29%), as did non-natives (similar to 1%). Endemic species cover was associated with higher elevations in both prior surveys and in 2018, and with steeper plot slopes in prior surveys. However, change in endemic cover over time was negatively correlated with slope, likely due to landslide disturbance or the proliferation of shade-tolerant invaders in low-light conditions where no disturbance was evident. Change in endemic species cover over time was not clearly related to resource availability (light and precipitation). Given the differences in responses of endemic and indigenous species to abiotic conditions, and that the endemic species in this study were more susceptible to decline than indigenous species, the results of this study indicate that generalizations about natives as a single group can be misleading.

AB  - Free-ranging yak grazing is a regime specially adapted to high-elevation environments across the Pan-Tibetan Highlands, yet its impacts on alpine birds remain poorly understood. The Chinese Monal (Lophophorus lhuysii) is a rare pheasant species that serves as a representative and umbrella species for alpine meadow ecosystems in the mountains of Southwest China, and has long been regarded as threatened by free-ranging yaks. However, the actual impacts and specific mechanisms through which yak grazing influences Chinese Monal have not been empirically tested. Here, we conducted infrared camera monitoring in alpine meadows within the Wolong National Nature Reserve, Sichuan, China, from 2019 to 2022. We analyzed the effects of free-ranging yaks on habitat occupancy, activity pattern, and population density of the Chinese Monal using multispecies occupancy models, kernel density estimations, avoidance attraction ratios, and random encounter models. We found that interactions with yaks affect monal habitat occupancy in conjunction with other ecological factors. Specifically, the presence of yaks alters monals' occupancy responses to variations in grass cover and elevation, causing monals to use habitats with lower grass cover and elevation more frequently. Additionally, the activity patterns of the Chinese Monal and yaks are significantly different, and the presence of yaks significantly prolongs the time until monals re-occupy the same habitats. As an outcome of the cumulative effects of spatial and temporal avoidance, the population density of the Chinese Monal negatively correlated with increasing grazing intensity. This study provides the first empirical evidence of the negative impacts of free-ranging yaks on the Chinese Monal and elucidates the underlying mechanisms, highlighting great risks to conservation of this vulnerable species. Our findings inform the optimization of grazing management that balances production with conservation. Strict control over yak numbers and grazing areas in critical habitats for Chinese Monal and other threatened species could be a feasible compromise to mitigate these pressures.

AB  - Almost one third of global drylands are open forests and savannas, which are typically shaped by frequent natural disturbances such as wildfire and herbivory. Studies on ecosystem functions and services of woody vegetation require robust estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB). However, most methods have been developed for comparatively undisturbed forest ecosystems. As they are not tailored to accurately quantify AGB of small and irregular growth forms, their application on these growth forms may lead to unreliable or even biased AGB estimates in disturbance-prone dryland ecosystems. Moreover, these methods cannot quantify AGB losses caused by disturbance agents. Here we propose a methodology to estimate individual-and stand-level woody AGB in disturbance-prone ecosystems. It consists of flexible field sampling routines and estimation workflows for six growth classes, delineated by size and damage criteria. It also comprises a detailed damage assessment, harnessing the ecological archive of woody growth for past disturbances.
   Based on large inventories collected along steep gradients of elephant disturbances in African dryland ecosystems, we compared the AGB estimates generated with our proposed method against estimates from a less adapted forest inventory method. We evaluated the necessary stepwise procedures of method adaptation and analyzed each step's effect on stand-level AGB estimation. We further explored additional advantages of our proposed method with regard to disturbance impact quantification. Results indicate that a majority of growth forms and individuals in savanna vegetation could only be assessed if methods of AGB estimation were adapted to the conditions of a disturbance-prone ecosystem. Furthermore, our damage assessment demonstrated that one third to half of all woody AGB was lost to disturbances. Consequently, less adapted methods may be insufficient and are likely to render inaccurate AGB estimations.
   Our proposed method has the potential to accurately quantify woody AGB in disturbance-prone ecosystems, as well as AGB losses. Our method is more time consuming than conventional allometric approaches, yet it can cover sufficient areas within reasonable timespans, and can also be easily adapted to alternative sampling schemes.

AB  - Aim: There is increasing interest in open- ended restoration with the focus on restor -ing natural processes rather than static compositional goals. Here, we investigated vegetation dynamics in response to three decades of trophic rewilding with large herbivores in a recent anthropogenic, fertile 55- km2 landscape on reclaimed marine sediments. This site provides important insights into plant community assembly in re-wilded, young ecosystems.Location: Oostvaardersplassen, the Netherlands.Methods: Using field surveys and vegetation data spanning two decades, we investi -gate vegetation dynamics of the mesic grasslands in Oostvaardersplassen, a pioneer trophic rewilding site in the Netherlands. To identify the effects of grazing and other ecological processes, we include comparisons to an adjacent ungrazed control site and to the dark diversity, that is, missing species expected to be present given the environ-ment and geography.Results: The impact of large herbivores has led to a more open and homogenous vegeta-tion with higher plant species richness in the mesic grasslands of Oostvaardersplassen compared to the ungrazed control. Compared to species in the dark diversity, the spe -cies present are more common in the region, more stress- tolerant, and less competi-tive, in line with joint effects of grazing and immigrational lag.Conclusions: The changes in vegetation composition and structure show that rewild-ing with large herbivores promotes the prevalence of stress- tolerant and low- staturedplant species, which are in decline in the broader landscape while reducing the domi-nance of otherwise widespread, competition-adapted species. The absence of numer -ous rare species suggests that dispersal limitation poses an important constraint for the diversity build- up in anthropogenically isolated natural areas, necessitating active species introductions to mitigate this issue in the short to medium term

AB  - Population density estimates are invaluable to wildlife managers, but difficult to attain. Several methods have been developed to estimate density using camera traps, many of which require further testing. The time-in-front-of-the-camera (TIFC) approach allows for density estimation when "unmarked" individuals are monitored using camera traps. We applied the TIFC model to populations of bison (Bison bison, B. bison athabascae), elk (Cervus elaphus canadensis), and moose (Alces alces) in Elk Island National Park (EINP) and to populations of elk and moose in Cooking Lake - Blackfoot Provincial Recreation Area (BPRA). EINP and BPRA are fully fenced natural areas in the Beaverhills Region of central Alberta, Canada. Our objectives were to (i) use the TIFC model to estimate ungulate densities in EINP and BPRA, and (ii) compare the performance of TIFC density estimates against aerial ungulate survey estimates. Camera trap data were collected from 43 cameras in EINP between December 2016 and October 2020, and 23 cameras in BPRA from April 2019 to August 2020. Annual densities were estimated in EINP north and south (2017-2019) and in BPRA (2019). Moose density estimates had the lowest discrepancy between approaches. Bison TIFC density estimates were lower than AUS densities, and elk TIFC density estimates were higher than AUS densities. In addition to the density estimates evaluated for the three focal species, the TIFC approach also was applied to white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (O. hemionus) in EINP and BPRA, in the absence of aerial survey data. We conclude that the TIFC model and AUS were complementary, with pros and cons of the two approaches varying based on focal species ecology. Careful consideration is required for several factors related to camera study design for TIFC density estimation that can affect the accuracy and precision of estimates.

AB  - Edge effects, the altered abiotic and biotic conditions on the borders of natural areas, have rarely been linked to altered soil biota, which shape ecosystem processes including carbon storage, biogeochemical cycling, and plant performance. Here, we investigated if increased wildlife populations (their increase mediated by foraging in nearby oil palm plantations) affect soil biota when they move between plantations and natural habitats. We used a 22-year fenced exclusion experiment in a primary rain forest in Peninsular Malaysia. We found that the presence of wildlife (mainly native pigs; Sus scrofa) was associated with greater bacterial diversity, an altered bacterial community composition, and indications of a reduced abundance of symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi. There were only minor effects of pigs on soil chemistry or microclimate, so we suggest that changes in soil communities are driven by pigs' leaf litter removal and alterations to plant composition. Our study highlights that indirect effects from agriculture can be induced by wildlife more than1 km into protected areas and this could have important repercussions for ecosystem processes and plant-soil feedbacks.

AB  - The primary utilization strategy for meadow grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is livestock grazing. This practice is considered as one of the major drivers of plant-associated bacterial community construction and changes in soil properties. The species of Kobresia humilis is considered as the most dominant one in grasslands. However, how different grazing practices affect the phyllosphere and rhizosphere bacterial communities of K. humilis is unknown. To address this issue, the effects of the grazing enclosure (GE), single-species grazing (YG and SG, representing yak only and sheep only, respectively), and different ratios of grazing (ratio of yak to sheep is 1:2, 1:4, and 1:6, represented by MG1:2, MG1:4, and MG1:6, respectively) on the dominant plant of K. humilis, it's phyllosphere and rhizosphere bacteria, and soil properties were investigated using artificially controlled grazing and grazing enclosure. Our data showed that grazing enclosure enhanced vegetation coverage, and rhizosphere bacterial richness and diversity, while reduced plant number and bacterial network stability of K. humilis. The NO3  -N, K+, and Cl  concentrations were lower under grazing compared to GE. SG reduced theconcentration of NH4+-N, TN, K+, and Na+ compared to YG. Moderate grazing intensity had a lower relative abundance of the r-strategists (Bacteroidota and Gammaproteobacteria) with higher bacterial network stability. Yak and sheep grazing showed reversed impacts on the bacterial network stability between the phyllosphere and rhizosphere of K. humilis. Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota were identified in the molecular ecological network analysis as keystone taxa in the phyllosphere and rhizosphere networks, respectively, under all treatments. This study explained why sheep grazing has more adverse effects on grazing-tolerant grass species, K. humilis, than yak grazing, and will contribute to a better understanding of the impacts of different grazing practices and grazing enclosure on alpine grassland ecosystems on the QTP.

AB  - Context It is important to understand the way in which wild herbivore grazing affects decadal vegetation dynamics after cessation of unnatural disturbances, especially in a context of climate change.Aims We investigated the decadal effects of different grazing regimes on treeless subalpine vegetation recovery from stock grazing and burning, on sites of different environmental character and initial state.Methods At each of four sites, two fenced areas that excluded mammalian herbivores, two that allowed in only rabbits and two grazed control plots were monitored every 5 years between 1991 and 2021. General linear models were developed to explain variation in change over the 30 years in different cover types. The years in which peak and trough values occurred were also determined, as were the incidence and direction of differences between treatments in sites and years.Key results There was marked variation in change over 30 years between the sites and lifeforms. Exclusion of mammalian herbivores increased the slow rate of revegetation. There was little effect from rabbits by themselves. Unexpectedly, the cover of both short and tall herbs was not promoted by grazing exclusion. Short term climatic variation affected some cover types, with many peaks and troughs in the dry year of 2001, but it was not possible to disentangle decades scale climate change effects from the process of recovery after disturbance.Conclusions The slight increase in revegetation rates in the absence of native herbivores and rabbits does not justify culling. Restoration interventions appear to be unnecessary. The prospect of increasing fire incidence and deer numbers suggests that it is desirable to continue monitoring the plots.
   Long-term monitoring on Tasmania's Eastern Central Plateau provides an opportunity to document the process of recovery from fire and stock grazing and the impacts of wild herbivores. After 30 years, vegetated ground cover has increased both inside and outside grazing exclosures. Although results between the four sites were variable, natural regeneration will occur without management intervention and in the absence of a catastrophic disturbance such as wildfire.

AB  - Introduced in similar to 59 countries and native across Europe and Asia, wild pigs, Sus scrofa, are the most wide-spread swine species in the world. As ecosystem engineers, wild pigs are a significant source of disturbance in introduced ecosystems due to their numerous, complex impacts on ecosystem processes. Wild pigs are often found in the resource-rich habitat of coastal forests. Coastal forests are complex, dynamic systems with tremendous biodiversity. Exposed to recurrent disturbances, the biophysical characteristics of coastal forests contribute to their ability to return to their original state post-disturbance. However, compounding disturbances can weaken this ability and threaten the health and function of the ecosystem. In this review, through the model of the forests of the southeastern United States Coastal Plain, we (1) describe conditions found across the forested coastal landscape, (2) describe wild pig disturbance, and (3) discuss how wild pig impacts can add to significant anthropogenic and climate-related disturbances threatening coastal forests. Through this review, we find that the impacts of wild pig disturbance on coastal forests often have similar effects as anthropogenic and climate change-related disturbances that may enhance these significant threats to coastal forest function and resiliency.

AB  - The endangered Yellow Cardinal Gubernatrix cristata is under pressure from habitat loss and from capturing for the cage bird trade. In north-east Argentina it is known to be associated with the Espinal ecoregion, but no information was available on habitat selection within this ecoregion. In Entre Rios province, Argentina, we first sampled Yellow Cardinal presence in four environments: Espinal savannahs, Espinal open woodlands, riparian woodlands, and agricultural fields. Yellow Cardinals were only detected in savannahs. In a second set of surveys, transects were surveyed at sites with known presence of Yellow Cardinals and were placed within savannahs as well as nearby in open forests of only slightly different physiognomy. Yellow Cardinals were again only detected in savannahs. Tree density, shrub cover and height of herbaceous layer were lower in savannahs than in open woodlands. Ground-foraging Yellow Cardinals in savannahs foraged exclusively in grass patches with short grass of 3 ˗12 cm height. Such short grass occurred in 75% of spots of savannahs sites, but only in 48% of open woodlands. Savannah sites with Yellow Cardinals were significantly further away from permanent roads than sites without Cardinals, likely a reflection of capture pressure near roads. We recommend establishing additional protected areas with a high proportion of savannah patches and with limited or no road access. The short grass used by foraging Yellow Cardinals requires maintenance through grazing. Rewilding with native herbivores in protected areas is preferable to attain natural herbivory, but during the initial stages of rewilding, cattle and sheep grazing are essential to avoid tree and shrub proliferation in savannahs. The Yellow Cardinal can also persist on private lands with Espinal vegetation under sustainable livestock grazing. Frequent and effective patrolling and road controls are essential to reduce illegal capturing.

AB  - Following a long-term herbivore-exclusion study (2003-2008) in the mid-eulittoral zone at Kalk Bay, Cape Town, South Africa, the post-herbivore-exclusion effect (12 years later) of the limpet Cymbula oculus, the dominant herbivore in the community, was examined after it had recolonised the area. Despite the limpet having recruited into all plots (previous exclusion plots and control plots), the species richness, percentage cover of sessile organisms, invertebrate densities and invertebrate biomass were all significantly higher in previous exclusion plots compared with in control plots. Cymbula oculus density was higher in previous exclusion plots (11.11 [SD 12.54] ind. m(-2)) than in control plots (9.26 [SD 7.97] ind. m(-2)) (p = 0.038); however, its biomass was similar between the previous exclusion plots and control plots (366.39 [SD 421.63] vs 367.96 [SD 285.44] g m(-2), p = 0.179), indicating that limpets outside exclusion plots were generally larger. This was likely because of younger C. oculus individuals, heightened interspecific competition, or insufficient space in previous exclusion plots. The observed differences might be attributed to a combination of factors, including the persistence of species that have achieved a size refuge from grazing and bulldozing by C. oculus, as well as the establishment of invasive mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis which offer secondary substrates and microhabitats for the establishment of macroalgae and other invertebrates. The recruitment of M. galloprovincialis into the previous exclusion plots is likely to be the cause of the alternative community state observed. Unless some extreme disturbance event occurs, the community from which C. oculus was previously excluded is unlikely to revert to its pre-C. oculus exclusion state.

AB  - Multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora [MPR]) is an invasive, nonnative plant that has invaded many temperate forests across the eastern United States, often outcompeting native plants for sunlight and other resources. Herbicides can control MFR, but they can also reduce nontarget plant species and threaten aquatic ecosystems. In a black cherry-red maple forest in the Erie National Wildlife Refuge in Pennsylvania, the US Fish and Wildlife Service introduced prescribed goat-browsing as an exploratory control method. In four treatments, browsed, browsed/herbicide, cut/herbicide, and an unmanaged reference, we evaluated preliminary effects of these treatments on MFR and non-MFR herbaceous vegetation. For MFR, the browsed treatment had 56% lower leaf/stem mass ratios and 35% shorter stem lengths than the reference; the leaf/stem ratio in the cut/herbicide treatment was 55% lower than the reference. Stem density was not reduced because goats did not kill the MFR plants in this first year of treatment. The herbicide treatment had fewer non-MFR plants than the reference treatment. Light levels at ground level did not differ among the treatments. Overall, 33% of trees in the browsed treatment were affected by the goats, with 9% being completely girdled; red maple and ironwood were the most commonly browsed species. Preliminary results suggest that goats can be an effective control for MFR, however long-term success will be best evaluated after consecutive treatment seasons. Goats may increase tree mortality and shift tree species composition in stands dominated by trees with high browsing rates, but effects on diverse stands may be less pronounced.

AB  - Theory predicts a decline in grassland diversity under nutrient enrichment and loss of herbivory, and one possible cause is hampered seedling recruitment. Two potential drivers for reduced diversity at the seedling level are diminished light availability caused by surrounding vegetation and accumulation of dead biomass. To test the importance of these two mechanisms on early recruitment, we added seeds of 15 herbaceous grassland plant species and monitored sown and natural seedling emergence during one growing season in a full factorial field experiment with light addition and litter removal under fertilization and exclusion of mammalian herbivores in an experimental grassland in Central Germany. We used modern LED lamps, mimicking the spectrum of natural sun light, to provide light to small-statured understorey plants. This novel experimental set-up allowed us to specifically disentangle the roles of light limitation and litter accumulation independently and in combination. In general, herbivore exclusion, but not fertilization increased the amount of litter biomass. Litter removal increased seedling number and richness by 83% and 33%, respectively, while light addition had no significant main effect on seedling recruitment, nor did it interact with any other factors, and did not affect recruitment even when litter was removed. In addition, fertilization had a negative and herbivore exclusion a negligible impact on recruitment, and these effects were independent of litter removal. Furthermore, seedling number and richness were unrelated to light intensity and quality, litter depth, soil moisture, temperature and C:N ratio. Synthesis: These results provide novel insights into the role of light limitation versus litter accumulation driving early recruitment and help understanding the mechanisms that affect diversity in grassland communities via recruitment. Our results highlight the detrimental role of litter accumulation as opposed to surrounding vegetation induced light deficiency driving early recruitment from seeds and call for management actions that reduce the amount of litter when maintaining or restoring diversity.

AB  - Moose present a complex management problem because they generate a mixture of benefits and costs to humans, some of which are caused by browsing of regenerating trees. We developed a Lotka-Volterra model, parameterized by moose management areas, to link moose browsing to spruce and balsam fir dynamics on the island of Newfoundland. The model predicts the distribution of moose, adult fir, and spruce well. Empirical estimates of juvenile fir biomass were variable, and our model predicted its biomass poorly. Our model predicts a small negative effect of moose on adult fir biomass (-0.06%) and juvenile fir biomass (-1.65%) and a small positive effect on spruce biomass (+0.02%) under baseline assumptions, but larger effects (+/- 10%-60%) if moose browse commercial softwoods preferentially. Small effects of moose on trees at steady state do not fully reflect the importance of moose because moose parameters (e.g., growth rate and harvesting rate) impacted the return time of our model from disturbance. Our model analysis demonstrates one way to add animal effects into vegetation growth models and suggests that parameterizing ecological models by management unit is useful when the data to support more detailed models are not available.

AB  - Sustained-yield hunting of introduced ungulates in the Hawaiian Islands often conflicts with the conservation of native species, but there is little reliable data to guide effective management. European mouflon sheep (Ovis musimon; mouflon) and axis deer (Axis axis; deer) were introduced on the island of Lana'i to provide additional hunting opportunities. Managers will require better information regarding the ecological associations of introduced ungulate species, relative to the habitats occupied, to resolve longstanding conflicts between native species conservation and sustained-yield hunting on islands. To address this information need, we modeled sheep and deer ecological associations, habitat-use, and suitability using data obtained from an intensive aerial survey completed in 2013 and temporally matching environmental data. In habitat suitability models evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) metrics, predictor importance in a generalized linear model (GLM) of deer decreased in the following order: afternoon cloud cover, topographic slope, mean annual precipitation (MAP), elevation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and bare soil index. In a random GLM model of mouflon, predictor importance decreased in the following order: afternoon cloud cover, deer habitat suitability, NDVI, bare soil index, topographic slope, elevation, and MAP. Mouflon were restricted to lower elevation arid slopes, whereas deer were more broadly distributed throughout upland environments of the island. The presence of deer was also an important predictor for mouflon distribution, although mouflon was not an important predictor of deer, suggesting asymmetrical competition. Removal of the more abundant deer population may lead to an increase in abundance and distribution of mouflon without containment. This work represents the first habitat suitability analysis for all nonnative ungulates on any entire Hawaiian island. Our results are applicable to other islands where conflicts may arise with introduced ungulates, sustained-yield hunting, and native species conservation.

AB  - The outcomes of species interactions can vary greatly in time and space with the outcomes of some interactions determined by priority effects. On coral reefs, benthic algae rapidly colonize disturbed substrate. In the absence of top-down control from herbivorous fishes, these algae can inhibit the recruitment of reef-building corals, leading to a persistent phase shift to a macroalgae-dominated state. Yet, corals may also inhibit colonization by macroalgae, and therefore the effects of herbivores on algal communities may be strongest following disturbances that reduce coral cover. Here, we report the results from experiments conducted on the fore reef of Moorea, French Polynesia, where we: (1) tested the ability of macroalgae to invade coral-dominated and coral-depauperate communities under different levels of herbivory, (2) explored the ability of juvenile corals (Pocillopora spp.) to suppress macroalgae, and (3) quantified the direct and indirect effects of fish herbivores and corallivores on juvenile corals. We found that macroalgae proliferated when herbivory was low but only in recently disturbed communities where coral cover was also low. When coral cover was <10%, macroalgae increased 20-fold within 1 year under reduced herbivory conditions relative to high herbivory controls. Yet, when coral cover was high (50%), macroalgae were suppressed irrespective of the level of herbivory despite ample space for algal colonization. Once established in communities with low herbivory and low coral cover, macroalgae suppressed recruitment of coral larvae, reducing the capacity for coral replenishment. However, when we experimentally established small juvenile corals (2 cm diameter) following a disturbance, juvenile corals inhibited macroalgae from invading local neighborhoods, even in the absence of herbivores, indicating a strong priority effect in macroalgae-coral interactions. Surprisingly, fishes that initially facilitated coral recruitment by controlling algae had a net negative effect on juvenile corals via predation. Corallivores reduced the growth rates of corals exposed to fishes by similar to 30% relative to fish exclosures, despite increased competition with macroalgae within the exclosures. These results highlight that different processes are important for structuring coral reef ecosystems at different successional stages and underscore the need to consider multiple ecological processes and historical contingencies to predict coral community dynamics.

AB  - Biodiversity underpins grassland ecological functions and productive capacities. By studying the mechanisms for the maintenance of species diversity in animal communities, we can provide important theoretical guidance for the optimization of grazing management and biodiversity protection. The typical grassland of Xilingol in Inner Mongolia, China, was used as the experimental area, and a grazing intensity experiment was set up. This consisted of four gradient levels that were grazed by sheep, which were available for continuous monitoring, namely control standard sheep unit center dot day center dot hectare-1 center dot year-1 (CK, 0 SSU center dot d center dot hm-2y-1), light grazing (LG, 170 SSU center dot d center dot hm-2 center dot y-1), moderate grazing (MG, 340 SSU center dot d center dot hm-2 center dot y-1), and high grazing (HG, 510 SSU center dot d center dot hm-2 center dot y-1). Nine consecutive years of multi-indicator monitoring of vegetation was carried out from 2014-2022, using monitoring data coupled with time series and inter-annual climatic (relative moisture index, RMI) fluctuations. This was done to analyze the impacts of disturbances, such as grazing use and climatic fluctuations, on the diversity of species and above-ground productivity of the community, thereby exploring the relationship between diversity and productivity, and provide possible explanations for the emergence of a range of ecological responses. The statistical analysis methods used were One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), general linear regression and mixed-effects models. The main conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) The grassland in the experimental area under CK had the highest diversity and productivity and the ecosystem was better able to buffer the negative impacts of climatic drought. Furthermore, the effect of climate on productivity and diversity weakened as the intensity of grazing increased. (2) LG to MG had a constant diversity. (3) Grazing utilization changed the relationship between community species diversity and aboveground productivity by releasing spatial community resources, altering the structure of plant communities, weakening competitive exclusion, and strengthening complementary effects. However, under all of the conditions there is a brief stage in the time series when diversity is stimulated to increase, and the higher the grazing intensity, the earlier this occurs.

AB  - Animal movement patterns are affected by complex interactions between biotic and abiotic landscape conditions, and these patterns are being altered by weather variability associated with a changing climate. Some animals, like the American plains bison (Bison bison L.; hereafter, plains bison), are considered keystone species, thus their response to weather variability may alter ecosystem structure and biodiversity patterns. Many movement studies of plains bison and other ungulates have focused on point-pattern analyses (e.g., resource-selection) that have provided information about where these animals move, but information about when or why these animals move is limited. For example, information surrounding the influence of weather on plains bison movement in response to weather is limited but has important implications for their conservation in a changing climate. To explore how movement distance is affected by weather patterns and drought, we utilized 12-min GPS data from two of the largest plains bison herds in North America to model their response to weather and drought parameters using generalized additive mixed models. Distance moved was best predicted by air temperature, wind speed, and rainfall. However, air temperature best explained the variation in distance moved compared to any other single parameter we measured, predicting a 48% decrease in movement rates above 28 degrees C. Moreover, severe drought (as indicated by 25-cm depth soil moisture) better predicted movement distance than moderate drought. The strong influence of weather and drought on plains bison movements observed in our study suggest that shifting climate and weather will likely affect plains bison movement patterns, further complicating conservation efforts for this wide-ranging keystone species. Moreover, changes in plains bison movement patterns may have cascading effects for grassland ecosystem structure, function, and biodiversity. Plains bison and grassland conservation efforts need to be proactive and adaptive when considering the implications of a changing climate on bison movement patterns.

AB  - Tree planting is at the forefront of the current environmental agenda to mitigate climate change and tackle the biodiversity crisis. In the United Kingdom (UK), tree planting has been a priority for more than a century and has helped increase woodland cover from a historic low of 5 per cent at the beginning of the 20th century to a current figure of 13 per cent. However, we still know relatively little about the long-term development of woodland creation sites (particularly of native woodlands) over ecologically realistic timescales. We surveyed a chronosequence of 133 temperatewoodland patches encompassing 106woodland creation sites (10-160 years old) and 27 mature 'ancient' woodlands (>250 years old), using a combination of field surveys and remote sensing techniques to quantify vegetation structural changes associated with woodland development. Woodland creation sites displayed similar vegetation development patterns to those described for other woodland systems, i.e. a gradual transition as woodlands undergo `stand initiation', `stem exclusion' and `understorey reinitiation' stages, and became more similar to `ancient' woodlands over time. Structural heterogeneity, average tree size and tree density were the attributes that varied the most among woodland developmental stages. In general, structural heterogeneity and average tree size increased with woodland age, whilst tree density decreased as would be expected. Younger sites in stand initiation were strongly dominated by short vegetation, stem exclusion sites by taller trees and older sites had a more even vegetation height distribution. There was a large degree of overlap between the vegetation characteristics of woodlands in understorey re-initiation stages and older ancient woodlands (partly driven by a lack of regeneration in the understorey); these results suggest that it takes between 80 and 160 years for woodland creation sites to develop certain vegetation attributes similar to those of mature ancient woodlands included in this study. Woodland management practices to create canopy gaps and reducing grazing/browsing pressure to promote natural regeneration are likely to accelerate this transition, increase the structural heterogeneity and biodiversity value ofwoodland creation sites and enable adaptation and resilience to climate change.

AB  - Questions have been raised about the application of conventional post-windthrow forest practices such as salvage logging, site preparation, and afforestation in response to the increase in wind disturbance caused by climate change. In particular, it is necessary to identify effective forest management practices that consider the pressure from deer browsing in forests in cold, snowy regions because the population of ungulates is expected to increase. The impacts of legacy destruction, i.e., the destruction of advance regeneration, microsites, and soil structure, caused by conventional post-windthrow practices have rarely been assessed separately from the impacts of subsequent deer browsing on forest regeneration or evaluated based on sufficiently long monitoring periods to assess vegetation succession. This lack of studies is one reason that alternative forest management practices to salvaging and planting have not been proposed. We conducted a field experiment at a large-scale windthrow site with a deer population to (1) assess the impact of legacy destruction and deer browsing on vegetation biomass and species composition after 15 years and (2) identify the effects of legacy retention. The study design allowed us to distinguish between and measure the impact of legacy destruction and that of subsequent deer browsing during a 15-year period. The results revealed the following: (1) Salvage logging and site preparation suppressed the development of biomass of shrub and tree layers in forested areas where harvest residues were piled up and shifted the plant communities in these areas to herbaceous plant communities. (2) Subsequent deer browsing suppressed the development of the biomass of shrub and tree layers throughout the forested site and shifted herbaceous communities to ruderal communities dominated by alien species; and 3. Compared with salvaging and planting, legacy retention enabled the windthrow sites to more quickly develop into a stand with characteristics similar to that of a mature, natural forest. Forest management practices that consider the presence of deer are necessary. We propose a policy shift from planting trees after salvaging to leaving downed trees to regenerate natural forests, unless there is concern about insect damage to the remaining forestry land in the vicinity.

AB  - Many coral reefs throughout the world continue to decline in health and resilience. In the Caribbean, much of this decline has been attributed to increases in algal cover due to the loss of herbivores such as herbivorous fishes, especially large parrotfish, and the sea urchin Diadema antillarum. In recent years, the combination of protections and natural recovery has helped these herbivores, particularly parrotfishes, to recover in some areas. This recovery has led to questions about how different herbivores affect both the overall benthic cover of macroalgae and the specific composition of algal communities. Toward that end, we designed a caging experiment in Little Cayman to manipulate density and type of grazers. Treatments included full cages (1.27 cm wire mesh) with 4 D. antillarum/m2 added, full cages with 1 D. antillarum/m2, lidless cages (fences) open to herbivorous fishes without D. antillarum, full cages (herbivore exclosures) that excluded most fishes and urchins and open cageless controls. Benthic cover was quantified to assess differences in percent cover and community structure of macroalgae and benthic invertebrates throughout the 5-month study. As the experiment proceeded, both percent algal cover and algal community structure in the full herbivore exclosures, treatments open to fishes (open plots and fences), and treatments with D. antillarum (both densities) diverged. No changes were observed in percent cover of corals or other benthic invertebrates. Overall, reductions in percent algal cover were greater in the high density (4/m2) D. antillarum treatment compared to the low density (1/m2) D. antillarum treatment or those treatments where fishes were allowed access. As expected, greater densities of sea urchins reduced algal cover more quickly. However, these high density treatments also affected the D. antillarum themselves. The condition of the urchins (assessed as ratio of mass to test diameter) at the conclusion of the experiment declined in the 4 D. antillarum/m2 treatment compared to urchins in the 1 D. antillarum/m2 treatment and natural populations. Moreover, high densities of D. antillarum were better able to reduce the abundance of the brown macroalgae Lobophora spp. and Dictyota spp. compared to natural assemblages of herbivorous fishes. These findings suggest that these different types of herbivores, i.e., fishes and D. antillarum, exert different pressures on available algae. Their relative abundances will likely dictate macroalgal community structure on Caribbean coral reefs, and thus the suitability of a reef for the settlement of vital sessile organisms, especially corals.

AB  - African elephants (Loxodonta africana), in conjunction with the community of browser species, exert substantial top-down control over the woody vegetation in savannas by utilizing large amounts of plant biomass, as well as through non-consumptive effects. However, how much browsers affect the pattern of proportional growth between different tree components remains understudied. Using vegetation data collected in 2000-2001 and 2019 for more than 3500 trees inside and outside Madikwe Game Reserve, South Africa, we determined the long-term effects of an increasing elephant population, in conjunction with the community of meso-browsers, on structural relationships in 13 tree species. The number of trees utilized by elephants increased between 2000 and 2019, but individual trees were not more intensively utilized. After almost two decades of use by elephants, we observed a reduction in the logged initial growth rate of the structural relationship between tree height and stem diameter, without modification of the asymptotic change in growth rate. Despite species-specific variability, tree height was overall reduced for a given stem diameter. Canopy area, as well as its structural relationship with stem diameter, remained mostly stable. We suggest that elephants are responsible for hedging by reducing tree height. Together with impala (Aepyceros melampus), the dominant species in this meso-browser community, they could stimulate regrowth by browsing the canopy of the vegetation maintained in the browsing trap. Our study emphasizes the necessity of long-term, species-specific studies to improve our understanding of how the browser community, and elephants in particular, affect structural relationships in trees.

AB  - Seabirds create fluxes of nutrients from marine to terrestrial ecosystems that influence the food webs of small islands. We investigated how guano inputs shape terrestrial food webs by comparing species of selected plant and animal species in a red-footed booby colony in Mona Island (Puerto Rico, Caribbean Sea), to sites of the island lacking guano inputs. We quantified guano deposition and its relationship to plant biomass production, fecundity and density, as well as the activity of native and introduced animal species. In general, guano inputs increased the gross primary plant productivity, size, and fecundity by twofold. Guano inputs were also associated with twofold increases in density of Anole lizards, but also to increases in the activity of introduced pigs (> 500%), goats (> 30%), and cats (> 500%), which negatively impact native species. In particular, elevated pig and cat activity within the booby colony was correlated with lower activity of endemic ground lizards and of introduced rats. Our results also suggest that severe droughts associated with climate change exacerbate the negative effects that introduced species have on vegetation and reduce the positive effects of seabird guano inputs. Our findings underscore the importance of allochthonous guano inputs in subsidizing plant productivity and native and endemic species in small oceanic islands, but also in increasing the negative impacts of introduced mammals. Management and conservation efforts should focus on the exclusion (or eradication) of introduced mammals, particularly pigs and goats, from remnant seabird colonies in Mona Island.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of wild ungulates on carbon (C) storage in a Mediterranean oak forest within Castelporziano Presidential Estate (Rome-Italy). Using a paired-site approach, we aimed to compare a fenced (FE) area, undisturbed from ungulates for 11 years, with an adjacent unfenced (UN) area exposed to continuous wild ungulate activities. Our findings reveal that ungulates increased soil organic carbon (SOC) in deeper layers (30-60 cm) by 87.2 %, likely driven by trampling-induced organic matter redistribution, while no significant changes were occurred in upper soil layers (0-10 and 10-30 cm). Aboveground living biomass C stocks were overall similar between treatments, however, shrub biomass was markedly lower by 78 % in the UN area, reflecting the effects of strong browsing pressure. Although total ecosystem C stocks were 26.3 % higher in the UN area, this difference was not statistically significant due to high spatial variability among plots. Overall, ungulates had a positive effect on SOC stocks but negatively affected understory vegetation. Their net impact on total ecosystem C sequestration remains unclear, possibly due to the short exclusion period and the prevailing dominance of pre-existing mature trees. Moreover, the observed vegetation shift, characterized by a transition from oak-dominated high-forest to mixed stands increasingly dominated by Carpinus spp., suggesting complex interactions between herbivory, browsing pressure, historical management, and climate change. These findings highlight the need for long-term monitoring to understand these effects and define effective forest conservation strategies.

AB  - <ol><li>Rapid vegetation establishment is an important goal for many freshwater wetland, coastal and terrestrial restoration projects. To accelerate the restoration process, managers often introduce target plant species, potentially generating priority effects that can lead to either divergence or convergence of community compositions over time, depending on the local biotic and abiotic conditions. These alternative trajectories pose the question of whether active restoration by initial steering of plant community composition results in a different long-term community assembly when compared to restoration via natural development.</li><li>Here, we tested vegetation development subject to active restoration or natural development strategies with plant introduction and protection against herbivory by geese (Anser anser). This was facilitated by a 1300 ha restoration project in which new, bare wetland habitat was created from soft sediments ("Marker Wadden", the Netherlands). We studied vegetation cover, plant community composition and soil elevation in a full-factorial experiment under grazed, ungrazed, planted and unplanted conditions for 6 years.</li><li>Without herbivory by geese, the planting of reed (Phragmites australis) accelerated vegetation establishment and resulted in greater vegetation cover. However, cover was dominated by reed, and plant diversity remained low. With herbivory, grazing on reed increased plant diversity. With herbivory and without reed planting, vegetation established slower. However, after 6 years, plant cover became similar to the treatment with planted reed rhizomes in the absence of herbivory-albeit with higher plant community diversity. Across all treatments, locations with higher vegetation cover decelerated soil subsidence, which maintained important abiotic conditions for the developing food web.</li><li>Synthesis and applications: Active steering of wetland restoration by introducing target species and preventing herbivory accelerated vegetation development, while natural development took longer. However, natural development resulted in more diverse plant community compositions over time. These results imply that restoration projects face a trade-off between actively stimulating vegetation cover to facilitate food web development and prevent soil subsidence, or waiting for more diverse plant communities to develop naturally.</li> </ol>

AB  - Understanding competitive interactions is essential to properly inform management strategies, in particular in the context of livestock-wildlife conflict across a degraded land, such as the case of wild guanacos in Patagonia. Guanacos are historically perceived by ranchers as livestock's main competitors, and there is a growing demand for reducing their numbers. However, both competition theory and available evidence suggest a more complex interaction than the one assumed by the current management approach. This study aimed to test the occurrence of competitive exclusion of guanacos by domestic sheep at intra-ranch scale. We assessed the spatial segregation of guanacos and sheep and compared guanaco occupancy patterns within a sheep ranch with those recorded within an adjacent protected area free from livestock. The probability of a group of herbivores being sheep instead of guanacos increased in bottom valleys and smaller paddocks and decreased as the distance to water increased. These results agree with the expected patterns of sheep habitat use resulting from physiological restrictions and grazing behaviour. Occupancy patterns within the ranch showed a higher proportion of guanacos in ridges, away from water sources and in larger paddocks, opposing those observed in the sheep-free area where guanacos occupied mostly bottom valleys, irrespective of the distance to water. Areas used consistently by guanacos showed a higher per cent cover of preferred forage and basal-plant cover, indicating a better range condition than those used predominately by sheep. Our results add to the solid body of evidence on spatial segregation of these species at coarser spatial scales, support the competitive exclusion of guanacos by sheep and suggest that intra-ranch coexistence is possible because guanacos occupy areas underused or inaccessible to sheep. Under these conditions, it is unlikely that guanaco culling will improve sheep production and the empirical verification of the assumptions underlying current management initiatives becomes crucial.

AB  - Trophic rewilding aims to promote biodiverse self-sustaining ecosystems through the restoration of ecologically important taxa and the trophic interactions and cascades they propagate. How rewilding effects manifest across broad temporal scales will determine ecosystem states; however, our understanding of post-rewilding dynamics across longer time periods is limited. Here we show that the restoration of a megaherbivore, the African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana), promotes landscape openness (i.e., various measures of vegetation composition/complexity) and modifies fauna habitat and that these effects continue to manifest up to 92 years after reintroduction. We conducted a space-for-time floristic survey and assessment of 17 habitat attributes (e.g., floristic diversity and cover, ground wood, tree hollows) across five comparable nature reserves in South African savannah, where elephants were reintroduced between 1927 and 2003, finding that elephant reintroduction time was positively correlated with landscape openness and some habitat attributes (e.g., large-sized tree hollows) but negatively associated with others (e.g., large-sized coarse woody debris). We then indexed elephant site occurrence between 2006 and 2018 using telemetry data and found positive associations between site occurrence and woody plant densities. Taken alongside the longer-term space-for-time survey, this suggests that elephants are attracted to dense vegetation in the short term and that this behavior increases landscape openness in the long term. Our results suggest that trophic rewilding with elephants helps promote a semi-open ecosystem structure of high importance for African biodiversity. More generally, our results suggest that megafauna restoration represents a promising tool to curb Earth's recent ecological losses and highlights the importance of considering long-term ecological responses when designing and managing rewilding projects.

AB  - Human-induced forest loss has had devastating impacts on biodiversity. Mammal populations in the tropics have been hit particularly hard by the resulting habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, as well as by overhunting which often goes hand-in-hand. While declines in these populations are generally well documented, few studies offer a pathway for their recovery. Here, we test the association between changes in forest habitat and occupancy trends of Sumatran megafauna (elephant and tiger) and key tiger prey species (wild boar and sambar) in the Leuser Ecosystem: a large forest landscape on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. For elephant and tiger, we develop additional occupancy models to predict their respective spatial distribution under different scenarios of forest loss and gain (through restoration and increased connectivity) to provide a blueprint for avoiding future species loss and assisting with their population recovery. From 2000 to 2019, 254,722 ha (6.7%) of natural forest was converted, primarily to plantations and shrubs. The species-specific responses over the study period revealed that the occurrence of elephant declined along the west, with a range shift to the northeast of Leuser, whereas wild boar underwent a dramatic widespread decline and although sambar experienced losses around the forest edge, it remained widespread in the interior forest, while tiger occupancy remained stable. Modelling habitat loss and fragmentation led to an unsurprising demise of Sumatran megafauna, whereas strategic investments that reconnected several forest patches provided disproportionately large benefits for their recovery through the recolonization of former parts of their range. Indonesia has achieved six consecutive years of declining forest loss rates, and our study's findings can build off this conservation success by supporting improved provincial spatial planning and field-based restoration efforts that avoid declines of threatened megafauna species and act as a catalyst for rewilding a landscape of global importance.

AB  - In the Neotropical cloud forests of northwest Argentina, cattle ranching has been historically the primary economic activity, with potential negative impacts on the ecosystem. Understanding factors influencing tree regeneration is crucial for reforestation efforts in grazed areas. Given the limited understanding of Parlatore's Podocarp ( Podocarpus parlatorei Pilg.) regeneration ecology, a unique gymnosperm species in the Southern Yungas' Montane Forest, we evaluated the growth and survival of its saplings for 1 year after planting them both inside and outside an exclosure, and in association with or without unpalatable nurse plants. Inside the exclosure, sapling survival was 100%, regardless of nurse plants. However, outside the exclosure saplings associated with nurse plants had 19.5 times higher survival probability. Growth rates were higher inside the exclosure and for saplings associated with nurse plants. The positive effect of nurse plants on growth was similar inside and outside the exclosure. Cattle browsing and trampling on Parlatore's Podocarp were observed for the first time, highlighting a previously undocumented threat to the species. Our findings offer valuable insights for ecological restoration, potentially suggesting strategic sapling planting near unpalatable plants and considering cattle exclusion in key areas to enhance long-term restoration success in the Southern Yungas' Montane Forest.

AB  - The abundance and composition of flowers within plant communities shape the resources available to flower-visiting insects. However, it remains unclear how nutrient enrichment and changes in grazing impact plant communities and their floral resources, and whether these effects contribute to ongoing pollinator decline. We investigated how the abundance, diversity and species composition of flowers (excluding graminoids) respond to long-term nutrient additions and grazing exclusion in two high-latitude grasslands (tundra and montane). We used two factorial experimental designs: 1) a nutrient experiment with additions of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K with micronutrients), and 2) a grazing experiment that included combined NPK addition with and without grazing exclusion. Flower abundance was assessed in 5 x 5 m experimental plots after 6-10 years of treatments. N and P interactively affected flower abundance, with N counteracting the positive effects of P. N reduced flower abundance in the montane grassland, whereas P and K increased it. Grazing exclusion increased flower abundance, with its effect amplified under NPK addition, but this joint treatment reduced flower species richness. Grazing exclusion reduced flower species diversity, with contrasting site-specific effects depending on NPK. N, P and K additions as well as grazing exclusion and NPK addition changed the composition of flower assemblages. At the montane grassland joint NPK addition and grazing exclusion led to strong dominance of forbs, such as Anthriscus sylvestris and Geranium sylvaticum, and grazing exclusion led to homogenisation of the flower community at the montane grassland. Our study demonstrate the importance of grazing and nutrients as key determinants of floral resources, which are vital for flower-visiting insects. We suggest that quantifying floral resources could contribute to ecosystem status assessment. Our findings offer insights for managing and conserving pollinator habitats in the face of environmental change.

AB  - Forest soils are shaped by various processes, like runoff, erosion, sedimentation and bioturbation. A better understanding of the interactions between abiotic and biotic soil-forming processes, including wild boar (Sus scrofa) rooting (i.e., subsurface foraging), enhances adequate management of forest ecosystems. We hypothesized that intense soil sedimentation influences wild boar rooting occurrence and that wild boars modify the outcome of the sedimentation process by redistributing soil layers. This study was conducted in the Babat Valley, Hungary. We estimated the availability of sedimented and non-sedimented patches and the occurrence of boar rooting. Surveys and samplings were done along transects, over consecutive months, where the impact of rooting on the physical and chemical characteristics of soil was measured by comparing them between control and rooted sites. We found that non-sedimented, steep areas were preferred areas for rooting. Sedimentation processes have a higher impact on soil chemical characteristics and soil layer composition than wild boar rooting. We conclude that mitigation of soil degradation can be more effective by reducing adverse abiotic processes rather than wild boar population control.

AB  - Located 1140 km from the South American coastline in the South Atlantic Ocean and with an age of 4 million years, Trindade Island is the most recent volcanic component of Brazilian territory. Its original native vegetation has been severely damaged by human influence, in particular through the introduction of exotic grazing animals such as goats. However, since the complete eradication of goats and other feral animals in the late 1990s, the island's vegetation has been recovering, and even some endemic species that had been considered extinct have been rediscovered. In this study, we set out to characterize the contemporary cryptic diversity in soils of the recovering native forest of Trindade Island using metabarcoding by high throughput sequencing (HTS). The sequence diversity obtained was dominated by microorganisms, including three domains (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) and five kingdoms (Fungi, Metazoa, Protozoa, Chromista, and Viridiplantae). Bacteria were represented by 20 phyla and 116 taxa, with Archaea by only one taxon. Fungi were represented by seven phyla and 250 taxa, Viridiplantae by five phyla and six taxa, Protozoa by five phyla and six taxa, Metazoa by three phyla and four taxa and Chromista by two phyla and two taxa. Even after the considerable anthropogenic impacts and devastation of the island's natural forest, our sequence data reveal the presence of a rich and complex diversity of microorganisms, invertebrates, and plants and provide important baseline biodiversity information that will contribute to ecological restoration efforts on the island.

AB  - Arctic-nesting geese are specialist herbivores of grasses and sedges (collectively, graminoids). Under moderate grazing pressure, these migratory herbivores can create and maintain arctic grazing lawns with high nutritional content and low aboveground biomass. Nutrient and energy subsidies from southern agricultural landscapes during winter have improved survival among populations of Ross's (Anser rossii) and lesser snow geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens), leading to marked population growth. Resulting goose hyperabundance has raised conservation concern for resilience of arctic ecosystems to withstand cumulative and intense pressures of herbivory and nest construction. We used both design-based (experimental herbivore exclosures) and model-based methods to investigate changes to plant community structure in direct response to foraging and nesting by these species within the Queen Maud Gulf (Ahiak) Migratory Bird Sanctuary, Nunavut, Canada. Annual nest construction and foraging by up to similar to 1.3 million geese at a large colony at Karrak Lake markedly reduced aboveground biomass of forage (graminoids) and non-forage (foliose and fruticose lichens) vegetation, with spatial variation in reduction associated with intensity of use by geese. Within vast brood-rearing regions, foraging reduced above- and belowground plant biomass of lowland plant communities by 61% and 29%, respectively, between 1994 (when herbivore exclosures were established) and 2017. In addition to landscape diversity associated with abiotic properties created by geomorphic processes, long-term herbivory by geese further increased spatial heterogeneity in vegetation at the landscape scale. Although foraging geese nearly completely depleted aboveground plant biomass in some parts of their brood-rearing areas, belowground biomass was largely conserved, and thus, plant communities had strong potential for aboveground regeneration. We propose that the effects of high-density nesting and foraging by Ross's and lesser snow geese in the central Canadian Arctic, while extensive, are ephemeral and prone to reversion following cessation of grazing and nesting pressure, such as that afforded by shifts in herbivore distribution or local population decline.

AB  - Mediterranean islands host unique ecosystems that are particularly vulnerable to invasive species. However, knowledge regarding the precise impact of invasive species on local biodiversity remains limited for many of these systems. Here we report on the negative impacts of invasive wild boars (Sus scrofa) on native snakes on islands in the Mediterranean basin. Capture-mark-recapture was initiated in 2012 on two snake species (Montpellier snake, Malpolon monspessulanus and Ladder snake, Zamenis scalaris) across two islands of Port-Cros National Park. Several wild boars, an invasive species, reached the islands in 2007. They remained confined to small areas of the islands for several years. In Port-Cros, the numbers of wild boars suddenly increased in 2015, and rapidly colonized the whole island damaging vast land surfaces. In Porquerolles, wild boars did not proliferate. This offered an opportunity to examine the impact of wild boar outbreak with a Before-After Control-Impact design (BACI). Snake counts and mark-recapture modeling showed that demographic traits were stable before 2016 for both snake species on both islands. As well as abundance, recruitment, and population growth rate of Montpellier snakes significantly declined where wild boars proliferated but remained constant on the island where they did not. Wild boars probably impacted snake numbers through habitat destruction and direct killing. The rapid decline of snakes (apex predators) and intensive uprooting that strongly damage ground dwelling species (plants, animals) suggest that wild boars represent a serious threat to island biodiversity. As elsewhere around the world, these invasive ungulates proliferate in the Mediterranean basin, they are proficient swimmers and exhibit a remarkably high invasive potential. We recommend vigilance and fast eradication to prevent population outburst; even a few a localized non-proliferating individuals contain the latent potential for devastating outbreaks.</p>

AB  - Depending on the plant species, animal trampling significantly affects vegetation by affecting seed burial in marl soil (MS). Soil seed bank dynamics (SSBDs) and seedling characteristics were investigated under light, moderate, and heavy grazing intensities in a MS and non-marl soil (NMS). Considering the seed characteristics and appendages, SSBDs and seedling characteristics significantly changed under grazing intensities (p < 0.05) where the greatest change was observed in MS (more than NMS). Seed size and seed sphericity index showed a significant positive relationship with seed burial depth under heavy grazing, while the seed length and width and the presence of appendages had the strongest negative correlation with seed burial under exclosure/light grazing (p < 0.05). Depth of 4-6 cm had the most seed numbers under heavy grazing. Moreover, heavy grazing reduced the diversity index in SSB by 34%, while the diversity index in vegetation has decreased by 41% compared to control.

AB  - Ongoing habitat loss and species extinctions require managers to implement and quantify the effectiveness of conservation actions for protecting biodiversity. Fencing, when done properly, is an important management tool for conservation in landscapes where wildlife and domestic animals co-occur, potentially enhancing habitat use through selective exclusion of domestic species. For instance, the fencing of forest patches in the Neotropics is expected to reduce the degradation of understory vegetation by cattle, releasing these resources for the native community of browsers and fruit consumers. Here, we implemented an ecological experiment using a before-after control-impact design to quantify the effect of cattle exclusion on encounter probability of the native community of browsers and fruit consumers, and percent ground cover in multifunctional landscapes of the Colombian Orinoqu & iacute;a. We built 14 km of wildlife-permeable fences along forest edges in four forest patches (i.e. blocks) containing control and fenced (treatment) sites. We installed 33 camera traps to obtain information about wildlife and cattle encounter probabilities, before and after the fences were constructed. We used Bayesian generalised linear mixed effects models to quantify the effect of fences via the interaction between the time period (before and after the fences were built) and treatment (control or fenced sites). Fencing was effective at reducing encounter probabilities of cattle in the treated sites, and it had a positive impact on relative encounter probabilities of four of seven studied wildlife species (herbivores including the black agouti [dry season only], lowland tapir [dry season only] and spotted paca [both seasons] and an omnivore, the South American coati [rainy season only]). The effect of fencing was negative for the collared peccary but only during the dry season. No statistically significant effect was detected for the white-lipped peccary or white-tailed deer. Synthesis and applications: We provide experimental evidence that fences are effective at selectively excluding cattle and increasing encounter rates of wild browsers and fruit consumers in forest patches where these species co-occur with cattle. Our results highlight an important application of fencing ecology in Neotropical forests, where the implementation of wildlife-permeable fences is feasible due to smaller body sizes of wildlife compared to domestic animals such as cattle.

AB  - The root causes of forest tree regeneration failure are difficult to resolve, although numerous studies show ungulate herbivory, soil conditions, and competition from undesirable vegetation as likely contributors. To better understand the relative importance of each issue, we conducted a 7-year manipulative experiment to assess the interactive effects of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) herbivory, soil acidity, and competing vegetation on tree regeneration in oak-hickory forests of central Pennsylvania, USA. Outcomes depended on initial tree seedling abundance, and all three factors had significant interactions. At low initial seedling abundance, fencing resulted in the greatest increase, but all treatments had a positive effect on seedling growth and abundance. At higher initial seedling abundance, abundance failed to recover 7 years after herbicide treatment and soil pH was an important predictor. When soil pH was >4.6 from lime application, seedling growth and abundance in unfenced controls with high initial abundance was comparable to the fenced-only treatment. Competing vegetation, assumed to be a symptom of excessive, long-term deer herbivory, does not seem to be the primary factor limiting tree regeneration in our study area. Ameliorating acid deposition warrants greater consideration as a management action because it could provide long-lasting benefits compared to short-term fence installations.

AB  - In the context of the biodiversity crisis, trophic rewilding became an important (but controversial) management practice to restore biological interactions and ecological processes. The success of this practice relies on the richness and abundance of other organisms, mainly invertebrates. In the Ibera wetlands of Argentina, a rewilding project reintroduced large herbivores locally extinct (the Tapir and Pampas deer, among others). Taking advantage of this project, we explored taxonomic and functional changes in dung beetle assemblages associated with replacing domestic livestock with native mammals. In five replicates, we sampled dung beetles with seven different baits, estimated temperature and grass eight and described landscape composition (forest and grassland cover). Through lineal and mixed models, NMDS and ANOSIM, we compared the taxonomic and functional dung beetle structure in both areas and explored the role of environmental variables. Trophic rewilding did not change dung beetle richness and the trophic structure of assemblages; however, it strongly modified the composition of species and their functional structure. Both areas shared 40 % of species. Species associated with cow dung (such as the exotic. D. gazella) became rare or disappeared in rewilded areas. Roller species dominated rewilded areas, whereas livestock areas exhibited a large abundance of burying species. The trophic rewilding changed dung beetle assemblages in the Iber ' a partially due to changes in the diversity of available dung but also on environmental conditions. Rewilding should include the medium and long-term evaluation of other taxa and ecological processes to quantify the conservation and functional value of species reintroduction.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) overbrowsing over the past several decades has caused substantial changes to plant communities in eastern deciduous forests. Deer-preferred species have declined or become locally extirpated in many areas while deer-tolerant species have greatly increased in abundance. Moreover, the abundance of nonnative invasive species has also increased over the last few decades, outcompeting many native species. Native shrubs such as Sambucus canadensis (American elderberry) are now much less common, particularly in urban forests and forests with high deer densities. Here, we performed a short-term study in which we introduced propagations of a native shrub into a replicated field experiment in which we factorially manipulated deer presence or absence and invasive species presence or absence by using exclosures and removing invasive species. We monitored metrics of S. canadensis fitness including leaf count and plant height over two growing seasons. Browsing substantially reduced survival whereas invasive species provided a modest degree of associational resistance. Browsing significantly decreased both leaf count and plant height. By the end of the study, individuals within exclosures had over twice the number of leaves, were five times taller, and had much lower mortality versus those exposed to browsing. Removing invasive species did not change plant height, however, S. canadensis individuals experienced marginally higher leaf counts inside exclosures where we had removed invasive species. This trend was opposite in individuals outside of fences such that those growing within patches where invasive species remained had slightly higher leaf counts, especially during the first growing season. Until the final census date, elderberry growing within patches of invasive species had slightly lower mortality versus those growing in patches where invasive species had been removed. The results from our short-term study indicate that browsing is more inimical to a native shrub than competition from invasive species and we did not find evidence of associational resistance to browsing from invasive cover.

AB  - Grassland ecosystems are species-rich habitats that are rapidly declining globally posing serious concerns for biodiversity conservation. This situation is particularly relevant in agricultural areas in Europe. As traditional management practices and livestock grazing regimes ceased, rewilding could be a potential avenue to tackle current biodiversity declines. To test this hypothesis, we set up a 3-year experiment where 12 horses were introduced in three 10-hectare enclosure replicates (four horses per enclosure). Horses were kept without supplementary feeding to mimic ecosystem functions of wild horses. We applied Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models and a backward stepwise model selection procedure to elucidate factors that modulate insect richness induced by grazing. Our results show that plant species richness, the proportion of flowers and plant height play a significant role for butterfly and bumblebee richness, while the opposite effect was detected for grasshoppers. However, the effect on grasshoppers was counterbalanced by increased grasshopper species richness in habitats adjacent to horse latrines. Implications for insect conservation Rewilding with horses may offset current biodiversity declines by maintaining important functional links between plants and pollinators in grassland ecosystems. Horse grazing can however have different effects on diverse functional groups of insects. Application of integrative landscape scale approaches may be needed to elucidate the effects of rewilding for certain functional groups such as grasshoppers. With current biodiversity declines, up-scaling rewilding research and practice might be crucial to mitigate the pervasive effects on insects as their services and functions are critical for our existence.

AB  - (1) Background: Desertification is one of the most important environmental impacts around the world. In the semiarid grassland of North of Chile, overgrazing has deep effects on arid lands and consequently on its economy and social development. It is necessary to conduct very detailed studies to determine how the climate, the botanical composition and the grazing system affects this process; (2) Methods: In this paper, we have determined the effect on arid grasslands of three goat managements: exclusions, continuous and deferred grazing on forage biomass, richness, Berger-Parker's dominance and Shannon's diversity. This study was developed in Las Cardas Range Station (CEALC) of the University of Chile in the Coquimbo region. The effect of annual and seasonal rainfall on biomass, diversity, richness and dominance parameters was determined; (3) Results: Allochthonous, endemic and native species showed significant changes both for seasonal and annual precipitation. In contrast, the grazing system only affected dominance and biomass of native and endemic species. Deferred grazing was the only management system that increased overall biomass productivity, especially on the best forage plant species. Exclusions showed a positive influence on more endangered species, which were the most vulnerable to goat overgrazing; (4) Conclusions: In consequence, we proposed a network of areas under deferred grazing combined with exclusions. This strategy can increase simultaneously forage productivity, grassland conservation and preservation of associated resources as hunting and wildlife tourism. Moreover, this strategy of range management will allow the sustainability of community of farmers in one of the poorest and most desertified areas in South America.

AB  - Seed predation and reduced predation risk with distance from conspecific trees are important influences on tree regeneration in tropical forests. Shifts in animal communities, such as an increase in rodents and other small mammals due to forest fragmentation, could alter patterns of seed predation and affect tree regeneration and community dynamics in forest fragments. We performed a field experiment on four native rainforest tree species in the Western Ghats, India, to test whether fragmentation increases seed predation by mammals and alters the distance dependence of seed predation. We monitored seed predation within open and mammal exclosure plots, near and far from the canopies of conspecific trees, in contiguous and fragmented forests. Seed predation of Cullenia exarillata, Ormosia travancorica, and Syzygium rubicundum was markedly higher in forest fragments, and more so within open plots than exclosures, while the predominantly insect-predated Acronychia pedunculata experienced similar predation in contiguous forests and fragments. Seed predation of C. exarillata and S. rubicundum was unrelated to distance from conspecific trees in open plots in both contiguous forests and fragments, in contrast to exclosures that showed marked near versus far differences in seed predation. Our findings suggest that by increasing overall seed predation risk and imposing similar seed predation risk near and far from adults variably across the tree species, small mammals could alter processes that shape tree diversity and species composition in fragmented tropical rainforests.

AB  - Ornamental plants constitute a major source of invasive species. Gaillardia aristata (great blanketflower) is planted worldwide and its escape has been reported in several European countries without ecological impact assessment on the invasive potential. As there is a markedly spreading population with invasive behaviour in Hungary, we aimed to reveal the distribution, impacts and traits of G. aristata. We gathered occurrence data outside the gardens in Hungary, based on literature, unpublished observations by experts and our own records. We investigated the impacts of an extended population, where the species invaded sandy old-fields within a 25 km2 area. Here, we compared the species richness, diversity, community com-position and height of invaded and uninvaded vegetation. Furthermore, we evaluated the traits potentially associated with the invasiveness of G. aristata in comparison with other herbaceous invasive species in the region. We found that G. aristata occurred mostly by casual escapes, but naturalised and invasive popula-tions were also detected in considerable numbers. G. aristata usually appeared close to gardens and ruderal habitats, but also in semi-natural and natural grasslands and tended to spread better in sandy soils. We found lower plant species richness and Shannon diversity in the invaded sites and the invasion of G. arista-ta significantly influenced the composition of the plant community. The trait analyses revealed that the invasive potential of G. aristata is backed by a wide germination niche breadth, extremely long flowering period, small shoot-root ratio (large absorption and gripping surface), large seeds (longer persistence) and dispersal by epizoochory of grazing livestock (mostly by sheep), probably helping the species' survival and spreading in the disturbed, species-poor, sandy, open habitats. These functional traits, as well as the ornamental utilisation, may act together with the aridisation of the climate and the changing land-use practices of G. aristata from ornamental plant to casual alien and then to invasive species in certain environmental conditions (i.e. sandy soils, species-poor communities, human disturbances), although it seems to be not strategy and long-term monitoring of this species would be important to halt its spreading in time.

AB  - Nutrients and herbivores are well-known drivers of grassland diversity and stability in local communities. However, whether they interact to impact the stability of aboveground biomass and whether these effects depend on spatial scales remain unknown. It is also unclear whether nutrients and herbivores impact stability via different facets of plant diversity including species richness, evenness, and changes in community composition through time and space. We used a replicated experiment adding nutrients and excluding herbivores for 5 years in 34 global grasslands to explore these questions. We found that both nutrient addition and herbivore exclusion alone reduced stability at the larger spatial scale (aggregated local communities; gamma stability), but through different pathways. Nutrient addition reduced gamma stability primarily by increasing changes in local community composition over time, which was mainly driven by species replacement. Herbivore exclusion reduced gamma stability primarily by decreasing asynchronous dynamics among local communities (spatial asynchrony). Their interaction weakly increased gamma stability by increasing spatial asynchrony. Our findings indicate that disentangling the processes operating at different spatial scales may improve conservation and management aiming at maintaining the ability of ecosystems to reliably provide functions and services for humanity.

AB  - We assessed the effect of rangeland abandonment on dung beetle biodiversity and functional diversity in an African semi-desert region. Dung beetles were sampled on farms that were abandoned either over 10 years ago, abandoned one year ago, or not abandoned. We sampled from tree dominant landscape features including dry riverbeds, flatlands, and hills. We hypothesised that rangeland abandonment would decrease dung beetle biodiversity and functional diversity, also testing whether this pattern holds true across the dominant landscape features. Preference experiments revealed that all dung beetle species preferred dung resources other than sheep dung. Contrary to expectations, dung beetle biodiversity and functional richness was higher on abandoned rangelands. The landscape features that were particularly significant in sustaining high dung beetle diversity and functional diversity in this ecosystem were the flatlands and dry riverbeds, the main corridors of movement of animals. We speculate that rangeland abandonment improved conditions for most dung beetle species, due to decreased pressures on remaining native mammal populations. Despite this, larger species that need greater dung resources for development became rare after abandonment. Reintroductions of native mammals should therefore be encouraged to promote dung beetle biodiversity and functional diversity in this semi-desert ecosystem.

AB  - Global climate change can interact with local drivers, such as ecosystem engineers, to exacerbate changes in ecosystem structure and function, with socio-ecological consequences. For regions of Indigenous interest, there may also be cultural consequences if species and areas affected are culturally significant. Here we describe a participatory approach between the Indigenous (Yolngu) Yirralka Rangers and non-Indigenous researchers that explored the interaction between sea level rise and feral ungulate ecosystem engineers on culturally significant floodplains in the Laynhapuy Indigenous Protected Area (IPA), northern Australia. A feral ungulate exclusion fence array (12 fenced and 12 unfenced plots) was stratified by elevation/salinity to disentangle the effects of salinity and ungulates on floodplain soil and vegetation. We found that exclusion of feral ungulates improved ground cover vegetation, which, according to our literature-derived ecosystem process model, may enhance soil trapping and reduce evapotranspiration to provide the antecedent conditions needed to improve floodplain resilience to sea level rise. The mid-zone of the supratidal floodplain study site was suggested as the region where the benefits of fencing were most pronounced after two years and ground cover species diversity was highest. Ongoing monitoring is required to investigate whether removal of feral ungulates can increase resilience against sea level rise and recruitment of eco-culturally significant Melaleuca species. An interview with a key Yolngu Traditional Owner of the study site demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of the partnership. Yolngu land owners and rangers were active co-researchers and will decide if, when and how to integrate results into feral ungulate management and climate adaptation responses, highlighting the importance of industry-university partnerships in maximising biocultural conservation outcomes.

AB  - Since the late 1800s, north Australian savannas have experienced a fundamental shift in grazing pressure, moving from an assemblage of native macropods to introduced ungulates. In contrast to macropods, ungulates have hard hooves, are greater in size and exhibit bulk feeding strategies, resulting in a greater impact on perennial grass cover. However, the response of perennial grasses to ungulate grazing may vary depending on rainfall, soil fertility and fire, as well as ungulate density and feeding behaviour. Interactions between grazing, drought and fire are of particular interest, as climate change is predicted to increase rainfall variability and fire frequency across northern Australia. In this study, we tested for interactions between grazing and drought, as well as fire and grazing, on two vegetation zones surrounding waterholes, through a 5 years fencing exclusion experiment. Despite drought conditions occurring over 2 years of the study, no interaction between grazing and drought was detected. This is most likely due to the relatively low ungulate density present during the study (similar to 1 ungulate/km(2)). In contrast, after fire was introduced to the study sites, significantly more perennial grass cover was recorded at fenced sites relative to unfenced sites. Due to the study design the cause of change cannot be directly inferred. However, when the potential drivers are considered further (rainfall, soil properties, fire and changes in ungulate density), an interaction between grazing and fire is the most probable cause. Wetland vegetation showed a stronger response to fencing than the surrounding savanna, with this result most likely due to differences in ungulate feeding behaviour between the two vegetation zones. Our findings are important, as fire and ungulate grazing are both widespread across Australia's savannas and reduced perennial grass cover has been linked to increased cat predation on rapidly declining small, native mammal populations.

AB  - Translocation of animals for conservation has a long history of successes and failures since humans began intervening with species distributions in the early part of the 20th century. Effects of translocations on other species occupying the area of introduction are rarely considered in species management plans. We hypothesized that the introduction of a large-bodied ungulate, Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus canadensis nelsoni), would cause a shift in the spatial distribution and winter habitat selection of a smaller-bodied ungulate, Rocky Mountain mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus), already occupying the study area in northeastern Nevada. We examined mule deer survey locations during an 8-year time interval from 1993 to 2001 to test hypotheses related to potential competition with or displacement of mule deer following introduction of elk in 1997. We used geospatial statistics to quantify changes in seasonal distributions of mule deer and a resource selection function (RSF) framework to model changes in selection of resources by mule deer before and after elk were translocated into our study area. Our results indicated that mule deer exhibited a shift in their core distribution by approximately 5.72 km after the introduction of elk. Mule deer changed their use of habitat by selecting shallower slopes, more north-facing aspects, and areas farther from the elk release site, where most of the elk congregated. Mule deer selected habitats with more pinyon-juniper tree cover and mixed shrublands prior to the elk translocation, indicating a potential tradeoff in thermal cover and forage quality. This research is one of the few empirical studies to describe competitive interactions between elk and mule deer on a shared winter range in North America. Implications of this research have importance for managers concerned with restoring communities to their native conditions especially where the potential for competition with non-indigenous species or other competing species with similar niche requirements exists.

AB  - Deer overpopulation is occurring worldwide, and deer-induced soil runoff into streams increases levels of sus-pended sediment and fine sedimentation. While deer-induced fine sedimentation in depositional habitats including first-and fourth-order streams is known to alter macroinvertebrate communities, effects of drifting suspended sediment in erosional habitats between the stream orders are poorly understood. Here, habitat and macroinvertebrate community structures in first-to third-order streams were compared between deer-excluded and grazed catchments of a Japanese headwater system. Fine sediment cover on the streambed was significantly greater in the grazed catchments than the deer-excluded catchment only for first-order streams, while macro-invertebrate community structure differed distinctly between the deer-excluded and grazed catchments at all stream orders. Burrowing collector-gatherers, which inhabit fine streambed sediments, were less abundant in first-order streams in the deer-excluded catchment than the grazed catchments, while clinging collector-filterers, which are vulnerable to suspended sediment inputs, were more abundant in second-and third-order streams of the deer-excluded catchment than the grazed catchments. These results suggest that the effect of deer exclusion on stream ecosystems varies with longitudinal changes in sediment deposition and transport capacity. Hydro-geomorphological processes are thus fundamental to assessing the restoration of forest-stream ecosystems, particularly in spatiotemporally dynamic headwater systems.

AB  - In semi-arid environments characterized by erratic rainfall and scattered primary production, migratory movements are a key survival strategy of large herbivores to track resources over vast areas. Veterinary Cordon Fences (VCFs), intended to reduce wildlife-livestock disease transmission, fragment large parts of southern Africa and have limited the movements of large wild mammals for over 60 years. Consequently, wildlife-fence interactions are frequent and often result in perforations of the fence, mainly caused by elephants. Yet, we lack knowledge about at which times fences act as barriers, how fences directly alter the energy expenditure of native herbivores, and what the consequences of impermeability are. We studied 2-year ungulate movements in three common antelopes (springbok, kudu, eland) across a perforated part of Namibia's VCF separating a wildlife reserve and Etosha National Park using GPS telemetry, accelerometer measurements, and satellite imagery. We identified 2905 fence interaction events which we used to evaluate critical times of encounters and direct fence effects on energy expenditure. Using vegetation type-specific greenness dynamics, we quantified what animals gained in terms of high quality food resources from crossing the VCF. Our results show that the perforation of the VCF sustains herbivore-vegetation interactions in the savanna with its scattered resources. Fence permeability led to peaks in crossing numbers during the first flush of woody plants before the rain started. Kudu and eland often showed increased energy expenditure when crossing the fence. Energy expenditure was lowered during the frequent interactions of ungulates standing at the fence. We found no alteration of energy expenditure when springbok immediately found and crossed fence breaches. Our results indicate that constantly open gaps did not affect energy expenditure, while gaps with obstacles increased motion. Closing gaps may have confused ungulates and modified their intended movements. White browsing, sedentary kudu's use of space was less affected by the VCF; migratory, mixed-feeding springbok, and eland benefited from gaps by gaining forage quality and quantity after crossing. This highlights the importance of access to vast areas to allow ungulates to track vital vegetation patches.

AB  - Introducing non-native tree species into forest ecosystems is a growing trend, in part as climate change may cause a decline of native species and shifts in species distributions. In European forestry, Quercus rubra (northern red oak) has increasingly been considered a candidate substitute species for native oaks. However, it remains largely unknown how this substitution affects associated biodiversity. This study compares the biodiversity supported by the native oak species Q. petraea (sessile oak) and Q. robur (pedunculate oak) and the invasive Q. rubra in southern Sweden, focusing on both oak-associated organisms and general forest biodiversity. Arthropods were sampled using Malaise traps at the site level. At the same time, vascular plants, leaf herbivory and endophytic insects (leaf miners and gallers) were recorded at the tree level in three sites per oak species. Our results reveal guild-specific effects of oak species on biodiversity. The introduced Q. rubra supported significantly fewer endophytic insects than native oak species. Vascular plant species richness was marginally lower in Q. petraea and Q. rubra sites compared to Q. robur. In contrast, the species richness, abundance, biomass and community composition of arthropods and leaf herbivory did not differ significantly between the three oak species. These findings indicate that the ecological consequences for biodiversity of introduced tree species, such as Q. rubra, are most pronounced for specialised herbivores, including leaf miners and gallers, and suggest that broader forest biodiversity measures may be less responsive to changes in tree species than to local environmental conditions.

AB  - Below-ground food webs in grasslands are affected by both above-ground herbivory and invasive plant species. However, the combined effects of these factors on soil organisms and their interactions with plant communities remain poorly understood. We investigated how the invasive African lovegrass (ALG) influenced below-ground food webs in south-eastern Australian grasslands under different herbivory regimes. Using experimental exclosures, we established four treatments varying in herbivore presence (all animals present, non-native mammals excluded, all mammals excluded, all above-ground dwelling animals excluded) across sites dominated either by native kangaroo grass (KG; native sites) or co-dominated by KG and ALG (invaded sites). After 4 years, our results revealed that invasive grasses significantly altered the abundance and structure of soil bacteria, fungi, nematodes, arthropods and earthworms. These effects intensified along the gradient of herbivore exclusion. In parallel with herbivore exclusion, accumulated plant litter shifted decomposition from bacterial to fungal-dominated, driven by changes in soil temperature, moisture and substrate, ultimately reshaping the soil biota assemblages. Herbivory, particularly by both native and non-native mammals, mitigated many of the adverse impacts of grass species invasion, with native and non-native mammals acting additively. These findings underscore the intricate interplay between invasive grasses and herbivory, emphasising the importance of integrated management strategies to maintain the ecological balance of grassland ecosystems.

AB  - Animals provide services such as pollination and pest control in cacao agroforestry systems, but also disservices. Yet, their combined contributions to crop yield and fruit loss are mostly unclear. In a full-factorial field experiment in northwestern Peru, we excluded flying insects, ants, birds and bats from cacao trees and assessed several productivity indicators. We quantified the contribution of each group to fruit set, fruit loss and marketable yield and evaluated how forest distance and canopy closure affected productivity. Fruit set dropped (from 1.7% to 0.3%) when flying insects were excluded and tripled at intermediate (40%) compared to high (greater than 80%) canopy cover in the non-exclusion treatment. Fruit set also dropped with bird and bat exclusion, potentially due to increased abundances of arthropods preying on pollinators or flower herbivores. Overall, cacao yields more than doubled when birds and bats had access to trees. Ants were generally associated with fruit loss, but also with yield increases in agroforests close to forest. We also evidenced disservices generated by squirrels, leading to significant fruit losses. Our findings show that several functional groups contribute to high cacao yield, while trade-offs between services and disservices need to be integrated in local and landscape-scale sustainable cacao agroforestry management.

AB  - Aim: Seasonal migrations, such as those of ungulates, are particularly threatened by habitat transformations and fragmentation, climate and other environmental changes caused by anthropogenic activities. Mountain ungulate migrations are neglected because they are relatively short, although traversing heterogeneous altitudinal gradients particularly exposed to anthropogenic threats. Detecting migration routes of these species and understanding their drivers are therefore of primary importance to predict connectivity and preserve ecosystem functions and services. The populations of Alpine ibex Capra ibex have all been reintroduced from the last remnant source population. Despite a general increase in abundance and overall distribution range, ibex populations are mostly disconnected but display intra-population migrations. Therefore, its conservation is strictly linked to the interplay between external threats and related behavioural responses, including space use and migration. Location: Austria, France, Italy and Switzerland. Methods: By using 337 migratory tracks from 425 GPS-collared individuals from 15 Alpine ibex populations distributed across their entire range, we (i) identified the environmental drivers of movement corridors in both spring and autumn and (ii) compared the ability of a connectivity modelling algorithm to predict migratory movements between seasonal ranges of the 15 populations, using either population-specific or multipopulation datasets, and three validation procedures. Results: Steep, south-facing, snow-free slopes were selected while high elevation changes were avoided. This revealed the importance of favourable resources and an attempt to limit energy expenditures and perceived predation risk. The abilities of the modelling methods we compared to predict migratory connectivity from the results of those movement analyses were similar. Main Conclusions: The trade-off between energy expenditure, food and cover was the major driver of migration routes and was overall consistent among populations. Based on these findings, we provided useful connectivity models to inform conservation of Alpine ibex and its habitats, and a framework for future research investigating connectivity in migratory species.

AB  - Mountains harbour a disproportionate amount of biodiversity that is explained by both biotic and abiotic factors. Understanding the ultimate factors that shape these gradients including the interaction between trophic levels is important to highlight management practices that may help maintain biodiversity. Here we report an experiment carried out in a Pyrenean valley where a transhumant cattle herd grazes every year subalpine grasslands in a 700 m altitudinal range (1300-2000 m). In 2018 we measured species richness and abundance of plants and two groups of herbivorous insects (butterflies and grasshoppers) in 20 plots, and then we established 10 exclusion plots to study the effect of grazing during 2019 and 2020. Our results show that there were differences among the relative weight of abiotic and biotic factors that shape biodiversity gradients. Overall, the elevation gradient strongly affected plant, butterfly and grasshopper richness, as well as insect abundances. Plant and butterfly richness's were correlated via a cascading trophic effect while the slope played a very important role for grasshoppers. Livestock exclusion had a negative effect on plant richness through rapid growth of grass species but there were almost no changes in insect community composition after two years. The intra-annual effects of grazing showed early grazing to be positive for butterflies flying later during the season, as seen for a subset of plots within a narrow altitudinal range. In grazed plots, butterfly richness and abundance increased over the summer when the herd moved to alpine environments and exceeded those of non-grazed plots, indicating that a traditional transhumance management system can help sustain biodiversity in subalpine grasslands as a type of extensive grazing.Implications for insect conservation.Traditional grazing by transhumance systems allows grasslands maintenance in subalpine areas, which helps sustain butterfly and grasshopper populations.

AB  - The main paradigm for protection of biodiversity, focusing on maintaining or restoring conditions where humans leave no or little impact, risks overlooking anthropogenic landscapes harboring a rich native biodiversity. An example is northern European agricultural landscapes with traditionally managed semi-natural grasslands harboring an exceptional local richness of many taxa, such as plants, fungi and insects. During the last century these grasslands have declined by more than 95%, i.e. in the same magnitude as other, internationally more recognized declines of natural habitats. In this study, data from the Swedish Red List was used to calculate tentative extinction rates for vascular plants, insects (Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera) and fungi, given a scenario where such landscapes would vanish. Conservative estimates suggest that abandonment of traditional management in these landscapes would result in elevated extinction rates in all these taxa, between two and three orders of magnitude higher than global background extinction rates. It is suggested that the species richness in these landscapes reflects a species pool from Pleistocene herbivore-structured environments, which, after the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna, was rescued by the introduction of pre-historic agriculture. Maintaining traditionally managed agricultural landscapes is of paramount importance to prevent species loss. There is no inherent conflict between preservation of anthropogenic landscapes and remaining 'wild' areas, but valuating also anthropogenic landscapes is essential for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Invasive species have established populations around the world and, in the process, characteristics of their realized environmental niches have changed. Because of their popularity as a source of game, deer have been introduced to, and become invasive in, many different environments around the world. As such, deer should provide a good model system in which to test environmental niche shifts. Using the current distributions of the six deer species present in Australia, we quantified shifts in their environmental niches that occurred since introduction; we determined the differences in suitable habitat between their international (native and invaded) and their Australian ranges. Given knowledge of their Australian habitat use, we then modeled the present distribution of deer in Australia to assess habitat suitability, in an attempt to predict future deer distributions. We show that the Australian niches of hog (Axis porcinus), fallow (Dama dama), red (Cervus elaphus), rusa (C. timorensis), and sambar deer (C. unicolor), but not chital deer (A. axis), were different to their international ranges. When we quantified the potential range of these six species in Australia, chital, hog, and rusa deer had the largest areas of suitable habitat outside their presently occupied habitat. The other three species had already expanded outside the ranges that we predicted as suitable. Here, we demonstrate that deer have undergone significant environmental niche shifts following introduction into Australia, and these shifts are important for predicting the future spread of these invasive species. It is important to note that current Australian and international environmental niches did not necessarily predict range expansions, thus wildlife managers should treat these analyses as conservative estimates.

AB  - Purpose Soil diaspore banks of bryophytes are poorly known in tundra grasslands, yet can be important for the maintenance of local bryophyte assemblages. We examined the effects of fertilization and grazing exclusion on above-ground bryophyte assemblages and soil diaspore banks in a tundra grassland. Methods We collected soil diaspore samples and recorded the cover of above-ground bryophytes from a full-factorial experiment with NPK fertilization and grazing exclusion treatments (a Nutrient Network site in NW Finland). Soil diaspore samples were germinated on trays in a greenhouse. We analyzed the compositions of diaspore bank assemblages and of above-ground assemblages and assessed their responses to the experimental treatments. Results The diaspore bank contained c. 50% of taxa found in above-ground assemblages; 26 bryophyte taxa germinated from the diaspore bank, while 40 taxa were found in the above-ground assemblages. These communities had distinct species compositions: the diaspore bank was dominated by Pohlia nutans, while above-ground assemblages were dominated by several species. NPK fertilization and grazing exclusion had negative effects on bryophyte richness and cover in above-ground assemblages, and weaker effects on these responses in the diaspore bank. Conclusion Soil diaspore banks comprise about half of the bryophyte taxa encountered in above-ground assemblages. Bryophyte diaspore banks are more buffered against nutrient enrichment and grazing exclusion than above-ground assemblages, suggesting that diaspore banks may enhance persistence and recovery of local bryophyte assemblages from environmental changes.

AB  - Questions: (1) Is the co-dominance of grasses and shrubs a general feature of Patagonian steppes? (2) At a local scale, does it change with domestic grazing intensity or decadal changes in precipitation?Locations: Question 1. Patagonia region in southern South America. Question 2. Shrub-grass steppes (45 & DEG;24 & PRIME;S, 70 & DEG;17 & PRIME;W) subjected to different grazing intensity for decades.Methods: We sampled vegetation to estimate perennial grass and shrub cover at two scales: regional and local. At the regional (phytogeographical) scale, we sampled grazed steppes under different climates and soils (n = 324 sites over ca. 487,000 km(2)). At the local scale, we sampled paddocks subjected to known grazing management, from commercial intensive densities of sheep to total (experimental) exclusion. Also, in the same site, we sampled permanent plots (25 years old) in a grazing exclosure to study the effects of precipitation variation.Results: Mixed communities are the predominant form of community organization in the Patagonia region. At the regional scale, shrub cover was negatively related to grass cover and communities where shrubs had higher cover than grasses represent 54% of the data set. At the local scale for an arid steppe, perennial grasses had higher cover than shrubs, regardless of grazing pressure. The shrub-to-grass ratio was increased only by intensive grazing. Permanent plots in a grazing-excluded paddock indicate that decadal xeric or humid climate periods decrease or increase total cover, respectively. Surprisingly, the relative shrub-to-grass ratio did not change significantly.Conclusions: Although perennial grasses and shrubs cover are negatively correlated, they coexist in the Patagonian steppes under a wide range of climate, soil and grazing conditions. At a local scale, selective herbivory promotes species replacement but did not substantially change the life-form covers. Water shortages, as well as periods of water surplus, similarly affect both life forms without compromising their coexistence.

AB  - Woody plant encroachment is influenced by interactions between the physical environment and vegetation, which create heterogenous microenvironments some of which favor shrub recruitment through mitigation of the abiotic environment. Encroachment of native shrub, Morella cerifera into grasslands on Hog Island, Virginia has been attributed to warmer winter temperature; however, recruitment of seedlings in grasslands may be impacted by multiple factors at the level of the microhabitat. Our study focuses on a critical gap in understanding factors specifically influencing M. cerifera seedling recruitment and survival. By experimentally planting M. cerifera seedlings at varying dune elevations and grass densities, we tested hypotheses that dune elevation influences the microclimate, soil characteristics and vegetation cover and that grass cover/density is related to shrub establishment. We tested these hypotheses through gathering data from temperature data loggers, conducting soil water content and chloride analyses, and determining percent cover of grasses relative to dune elevation. Results indicate that dune elevation was positively related to moderated temperatures with reduced temperature extremes and vegetation cover/composition that led to favorable locations for M. cerifera establishment and growth. Where dune elevation is > 2 m, we document an upper limit of grass cover on natural seedling establishment, suggesting a switch from facilitative to competitive effects with grass density. Overall, our work demonstrates interactions between dune elevation and medium grass density has a facilitative influence on M. cerifera establishment and can be used for future predictions of shrub growth with rising sea-levels.

AB  - Artificial hard substrates such as shipwrecks and large debris can impact biodiversity, especially in the deep sea where hard substrate is limited. A potential complex interplay occurs where wrecks provide surfaces for recruitment of epibenthic organisms and structured habitat for mobile invertebrates and fish but may also inhibit successional processes due to the presence of oil and other toxins. Here, we examined the interplay of these dynamics using remotely operated vehicle (ROV) surveys of the wrecks of the oil rig Deepwater Horizon, the SS 'Robert E. Lee,' and the USS 'Peterson.' Megafauna were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic unit using the high-definition video captured by ROV. Comparisons of the 3 wrecks revealed communities with unique compositions, but that did not vary significantly in total abundance, density, richness, evenness, or diversity. Furthermore, while species identities varied between wreck sites, the functional roles they fulfilled based on motility, tiering, and feeding mode largely did not. We posit wreck age, depth, and the presence of oil as potentially interacting factors influencing the assembly of these artificial hard substrate communities. As industrial activities continue to introduce more artificial substrates into the deep sea, our findings suggest that these structures may not support the diverse, thriving ecosystems typically expected, which has important implications for deep-sea restoration and conservation efforts focused on enhancing biodiversity through artificial habitats.

AB  - Feral swine were targeted for and successfully eradicated from Saint Vincent Island (SVI), a National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) along the coast of Florida's panhandle to protect its habitats and uncharacteristically high diversity of wildlife species for barrier islands in the region, including federal and state-listed threatened and endangered species. The eradication effort was initiated in early 2015 and concluded in 2019. A total of 438 feral swine were removed from the Island, 417 by federal control experts and 21 by recreational hunters. In general, the amount of effort needed to eradicate each feral swine slowly increased as the eradication effort progressed; however, effort increased by an order of magnitude in the final six months. The last three feral swine took 77 days of effort to remove. The eradication effort provided an opportunity for evaluating and comparing methods for indexing feral swine population abundance and their abilities to describe population trends and to detect animals at low population abundance. The feral swine population was monitored from 2015-2019 using a passive tracking index (PTI) twice each year and using camera traps. Camera and track plot data were used to calculate abundance indices based on a well-documented indexing paradigm applied to feral swine populations. In addition, we simultaneously monitored relative abundance of other mammalian species crucial to management for the Island. The PTI and camera index both well-tracked population abundance simultaneously for the large ungulates inhabiting the Island (feral swine, white-tailed deer, sambar deer). However, the sensitivity for the PTI to capture animal observations was much greater than for the camera stations. This held true even over 5-day observation sessions by cameras versus 3-day observation sessions for track plots. Additionally, the PTI was sensitive for simultaneously capturing data for smaller animals, raccoons and armadillos, whereas the camera stations were ineffective for the smaller species, likely due to camera positions being optimised to capture feral swine. Our 100-m track plots outperformed the camera stations in many regards, but the camera stations required less labour in the field and were less fragile in the field, especially from weather or access issues. In 2018, Hurricane Michael, a category 5 hurricane, struck SVI. Its habitat damage may have adversely impacted white-tailed deer and sambar deer populations, but not armadillos or raccoons. Both the swine eradication and hurricane impacts valuable means for

AB  - The presence of exotic herbivores can have detrimental effects on insular ecosystems because it usually involves the introduction of a previously absent functional group. Understanding feeding behavior is crucial to manage potential impacts, as it provides valuable information on which species may be most susceptible to the actions of these herbivores. We estimated diet selection of introduced red deer (Cervus elaphus) and goats (Capra hircus) in western Isla de los Estados, Argentina. We conducted floristic surveys to assess plant composition and forage availability at the landscape level. We evaluated the diet of both ungulates through microhistological analysis of feces during two spring-summer seasons. Overall, we detected 44 plant taxa in their feces, representing 67.7% of the plant richness detected in the field. Diet composition was similar between species, including a wide range of vascular plants and two groups of non-vascular plants, though both were dominated by a few species of shrubs and forbs. Nonetheless, both species select grasses, predominantly found in marine tussock grasslands, and trees mainly found as seedlings and sapling in forests and stunted trees in wetlands. Our results suggest that the introduced species exhibit overlapping forage selection, possibly having negative synergic effects on forest and grassland regeneration. This is concerning as these grasslands are of great importance for seabirds' reproduction. Our findings provide valuable information to develop management plans for the conservation of this unique island ecosystem.

AB  - Feral swine (Sus scrofa) as an invasive species in the U.S. have caused severe damage to natural resources through competing for food resources with domestic livestock and destroying habitat by rooting and wallowing. Given their increased population and wide distribution in the southern U.S., feral swine control is becoming an urgent issue for both natural resource managers and landowners. We conducted a three-state mail survey to examine feral swine damage in Arkansas, Louisiana, and East Texas in the western gulf region in 2021. Our results reveal that feral swine activities like rooting and wallowing can cause severe and widespread damage to agriculture and forestry. Among the most reported and concerned damage by feral swine were crops, pastures, livestock, and loss of land value. Soybean damage was the most important agricultural crop damage in both Arkansas and Louisiana while it was hay, silage, and forage crops in East Texas. In terms of livestock damage, beef cattle and calves were the most common and severe damage in all three states. Average economic loss due to feral swine damage was estimated at $67.13/ha, $42.96/ha, $27.31/ha, and $57.54/ha for landowners in the region who owned cropland, forestland, pastureland, and multiple land types, respectively. Those findings could help both landowners and wildlife management personnel understand the negative societal impact of feral swine, and they could also facilitate the comparison between expected benefits and costs of control programs/options for feral swine in the southern states.

AB  - The Judas technique is often used in control or eradication of particular vertebrate pests. The technique exploits the tendency of individuals to form social groups. A radio collar is affixed to an individual and its subsequent monitoring facilitates the detection of other conspecifics. Efficacy of this technique would be improved if managers could estimate the probability that a Judas individual would detect conspecifics. To calculate this probability, we estimated association rates of Judas individuals with other Judas individuals, given the length of time the Judas has been deployed. We developed a simple model of space-use for individual Judas animals and constrained detection probabilities to those specific areas. We then combined estimates for individual Judas animals to infer the probability that a wild individual could be detected in an area of interest via Judas surveillance. We illustrated the method by using data from a feral goat eradication program on Isla Santiago, Galapagos, and a feral pig eradication program on Santa Cruz Island, California. Association probabilities declined as the proximity between individual areas of use of a Judas pair decreased. Unconditional probabilities of detection within individual areas of use averaged 0.09 per month for feral pigs and 0.11 per month for feral goats. Probabilities that eradication had been achieved, given no detections of wild conspecifics, and an uninformative prior probability of eradication were 0.79 (90% CI 0.22-0.99) for feral goats and 0.87 (90% CI 0.44-1.0) for feral pigs. We envisage several additions to the analyses used that could improve estimates of Judas detection probability. Analyses such as these can help managers increase the efficacy of eradication efforts, leading to more effective effects to restore native biodiversity.

AB  - Invasive species are increasingly spreading, particularly in rangeland ecosystems. It is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of different methods for controlling invasive plants in these ecosystems. This study aimed to investigate the effects of three strategies-21-year grazing exclusion (21-YES), mowing-grazing in rotation in alternate years (MGRS), and moderate grazing (MGS)- on the change in cover, density, and biomass of Leucanthemum vulgare Lam. (Ox-eye Daisy=OED) and the plant community. To accomplish this, three sites selected for each treatment. In 2021, 270 vegetation plots were sampled using a random systematic method. Subsequently, we recorded the density and canopy cover of all growth forms (forbs, grasses, and ferns), the OED biomass, and the ground cover. The results indicated that MGS reduced OED density, OED canopy, and OED biomass. Furthermore, this strategy demonstrated the highest density and canopy cover of the plant community (including total, forbs, grasses, and ferns). Additionally, the strongest correlation was observed between the total canopy and the OED density (R2=-0.91, -0.95, -0.94 in 21-YES, MGRS, and MGS, respectively), as well as between the total canopy and the OED canopy (R2=-0.51, -0.98, -0.97 in 21-YES, MGRS, and MGS, respectively). The MGS led to an increase in diversity indices. In general, the grazing strategy has proven to be effective in controlling the spread of invasive OED and has also resulted in an increase in canopy cover, density, and diversity indices of the plant community. The study highlights the importance of ongoing management efforts to control invasive species, with moderate grazing potentially serving as a more practical, culturally accepted, and cost-effective short-term control strategy for widespread rangeland weed infestations.

AB  - Human activities drive ecological transformation, impacting island ecosystems from species diversity to ecological traits, mainly through habitat degradation and invasive species. Using two unique long-term datasets we aim to evaluate whether species traits (body size, trophic level, dispersal capacity and habitat occupancy) can predict temporal variations in the abundance of endemic, indigenous (endemic and native non-endemic) and exotic arthropods in the Azores Islands. We found that body size is crucial to predict arthropod abundance trends. Small-bodied herbivorous arthropods showed a decrease in abundance, while large-bodied indigenous arthropods increased in abundance, mainly in well-preserved areas. Also, large-bodied exotic arthropods increased in abundance across the entire archipelago. Moreover, endemic canopy dwellers increased in abundance, while endemic ground-dwellers decreased in abundance. Simultaneously, exotic arthropods showed the opposite result, increasing in abundance in the ground while decreasing in abundance in the canopy. Finally, habitat influenced both endemic and exotic spider abundance trends. Endemic spiders that occupy solely natural habitats experienced a decline in abundance, while exotic spiders in the same habitats increased in abundance. Our study underscores the significance of arthropod species traits in predicting abundance changes in island ecosystems over time, as well as the importance of monitoring species communities. Conservation efforts must extend beyond endangered species to protect non-threatened ones, given the increased extinction risk faced by even common species on islands. Monitoring and restoration programs are essential for preserving island ecosystems and safeguarding endemic arthropod populations.

AB  - QuestionsFire regime alterations are pushing open ecosystems worldwide past tipping points where alternative steady states characterized by woody dominance prevail. This reduces the frequency and intensity of surface fires, further limiting their effectiveness for controlling cover of woody plants. In addition, grazing pressure (exotic or native grazers) can reinforce woody encroachment by potentially reducing fine-fuel loads. We investigated the effects of different fire energies on the herbaceous plant community, together with mammalian wildlife herbivory (exotic and native combined) exclusion, to inform best management practices.LocationTexas semi-arid savanna, southern Great Plains, USA.MethodsWe conducted an experiment in which we manipulated fire intensity and herbivore access to herbaceous biomass in a split-plot design. We altered fire energy via fuel addition rather than applying fire under different environmental conditions to control for differences in standing biomass and composition attributable to differential plant physiological status and fire season.ResultsHigh-energy fire did not reduce herbaceous biomass or alter plant community composition, although it did increase among-plot variability in composition and forb biomass relative to low-energy fire and non-burned controls. Grazing pressure from native and non-native mammalian herbivores reduced above-ground herbaceous biomass regardless of fire treatments, but did not alter community composition.ConclusionsManagers seeking to apply high-intensity prescribed fire to reduce woody encroachment will not negatively impact herbaceous plant productivity or alter community composition. However, they should be cognizant that repeated fires necessary for greatly reducing woody plants in heavily invaded areas might be difficult to accomplish due to fine-fuel reduction from wild herbivores. High fencing to restrict access by wildlife herbivores or culling might be necessary to build fuels sufficient to conduct high-intensity burns for woody-plant reduction.
   We conducted an experiment manipulating fire energy and herbivore access to herbaceous biomass in a well-replicated, split-plot design. Managers seeking to apply high-intensity prescribed fire to reduce woody encroachment will not negatively impact herbaceous plant productivity or alter community compositional trajectories. However, exotic herbivores greatly reduce fine fuels.image

AB  - Herbivory by wild and domestic ungulates can influence tree recruitment and understory forest communities throughout the world. Herbivore-driven declines in tree recruitment have been observed for quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), a foundation species whose health and management is recognized as a critical priority throughout much of its range. Livestock fencing is commonly used to promote aspen regeneration, but its effectiveness is rarely assessed, especially across large spatial scales. Using a livestock-reduction experiment, we evaluated the effects of ungulate herbivory on aspen in the Great Basin and southern Cascades, an expansive and environmentally heterogeneous region where aspen faces the interacting threats of climate change, conifer encroachment, and herbivory. We found that livestock fencing only reduced the intensity of herbivore browsing on aspen when wild ungulate abundance was low and did not increase stem densities of aspen recruits. Contrary to expectations, wild ungulate abundance was a strong driver of browsing intensity on juvenile aspen within fenced, but not unfenced, aspen stands, and when the abundance of these herbivores was high, browsing intensity in fenced stands exceeded that in unfenced stands. The density of aspen recruits decreased with browsing intensity on juvenile aspen and with the density of both adult aspen and conifers, suggesting that both herbivory and intra- and interspecific competition are important drivers of recruitment. Fire history was also an important driver of recruitment, with stands that burned 10-20 years ago having the greatest density of aspen recruits. Finally, in the stand understory, we found that livestock fencing decreased forb cover, increased shrub species richness, and increased the cover of exotic annual grasses, a group dominated by Bromus tectorum. This latter finding suggests that livestock fencing may not be appropriate in areas where controlling the spread of this invader is a priority. In sum, our findings indicate that aspen recruitment is limited by browsing by both wild and domestic ungulates, is mediated by competition with neighboring trees and fire history, and will require management actions beyond livestock fencing, as this approach does not control browsing by wild ungulates.

AB  - Overgrazing by introduced herbivores is widely recognized as a threatening process in Australia's semi-arid rangelands. Comparatively, grazing by native herbivores is generally considered to have benign effects. Populations of introduced herbivores are controlled in conservation reserves, but populations of native kangaroos and wallabies are seldom subject to control. We investigated the impacts of rabbit and kangaroo grazing on vegetation and soils at Yathong Nature Reserve in semi-arid Australia during the dry conditions that prevailed in 2019. We conducted spotlight and dung surveys to measure the relative abundance of kangaroos and rabbits, and assessed understorey biomass, woody plant density, soil bulk density and water infiltration rates in selective herbivore exclosures that had been established in 1979, and nearby controls that all herbivores could access. Kangaroos were the dominant herbivores at the time of our study. Grazing by kangaroos decreased grass biomass, increased soil density and reduced the rate of water infiltration. Rabbits reduced woody plant density but had no detectable effect on understorey vegetation cover or soil attributes. Our findings question the existing paradigms about how grazing by kangaroos should be viewed and prompt the question: should kangaroo populations be managed within conservation reserves to reduce their impacts on ecosystems?

AB  - Foragers face many variables that influence their food intake, such as habitat structure, time, weather, resource characteristic and food quality, as well as plant defenses. I studied of the foraging behavior of free-ranging common duikers (Sylvicapra grimmia) within the Soutpansberg, South Africa. I measured foraging using giving-up densities (GUDs) and activity using camera-traps to test for habitat utilization and dietary selection by common duikers inhabiting a grassland containing distinct "islands" of woody vegetation. I used GUDs to test for: 1. Spatial and temporal habitat selection during the four lunar phases, 2. selection among triplets of trays with varying food density, and 3. among trays with varying food quality. Foraging was affected by the surrounding vegetation and moon phase. Foraging was highest (GUDs were significantly lower) during the no moon phase and outside the islands of woody vegetation. The duikers' foraging efforts changed with resource density and favored pellets with the highest protein content. The results demonstrated that foraging patterns are affected by habitat assessment and perceptions of risk which alter the overall habitat quality. The methods integrate behavior into wildlife ecology by "asking" the animals to reveal their perspective of the environment. The methods are applicable for predator-prey studies, habitat quality, and for assessing the impacts of heterogeneity on spatial and temporal habitat-use.

AB  - Emergent macrophytes can create important linkages between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. American water willow (Justicia americana) is an ecological engineer that provides structure and takes up nutrients in aquatic habitats but is subject to herbivory by terrestrial animals. Here, potential constraints that terrestrial herbivory, riparian shading, porewater nutrient stoichiometry, and co-occurrence with freshwater mussels may have on standing crops of aboveground and belowground water willow biomass were investigated across nine study sites in the Kiamichi River catchment, Oklahoma, USA. Stem damage - used to indirectly assess herbivore effects - and riparian shading were both associated with significant reductions in aboveground biomass. How-ever, these variables were also somewhat correlated with each other, suggesting a possible interaction between shade and herbivory. Belowground biomass was more variable between sites than aboveground biomass, but the environmental variables that were sampled failed to explain this variation consistently. Because shadier water willow patches tend to have nutrient-richer tissues, we suggest that the correlation between riparian shade and herbivore damage may result from selective feeding by terrestrial herbivores at shadier sites. However, further experimental work (e.g., using grazing exclosures) is needed to assess this possibility due to the limitations of using stem damage counts as an indirect representation of herbivory. Despite these limitations, the present study complements a growing body of evidence that shows emergent macrophytes are seemingly more important as a resource for herbivores than historically recognized. Emergent macrophytes may be especially important when consumed by terrestrial herbivores that then transfer aquatic-derived resources into the terrestrial habitat.Data availability: The data used to generate this manuscript are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

AB  - Introduction Small herbivores are important biological factors affecting plant productivity and species richness in the grassland ecosystem of the Tibetan Plateau. However, the response of different grassland types to the disturbance of the "endemic species" plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) remains unclear.Methods In this study, two representative grassland types, alpine meadow and alpine steppe, were taken as research objects to compare the effects of pika disturbance on vegetation structure and function indicators, and to explore the disturbance response threshold of these ecosystems.Results The results showed that the alpine steppe was more sensitive to pika disturbance, with significant decreases in biomass, vegetation height, and coverage even at low disturbance levels. In contrast, alpine meadows exhibited greater resilience, maintaining higher productivity and species diversity under moderate disturbance conditions. Notably, the functional index of alpine meadow peaked under moderate disturbance, while alpine steppe rapidly transitioned to a degraded state. These differences highlight the varying disturbance thresholds between the two grassland types.Discussion This study highlights the vulnerability of alpine grassland ecosystems to pika disturbance and provides a strong scientific basis for designing effective grassland management and ecological restoration strategies.

AB  - Large mammalian herbivores affect both plants and the small animals that live in and feed on those plants. The response of plant and animal communities to mammalian herbivory is variable worldwide, but rarely studied in North American salt marshes. We studied mammalian grazing (cattle, feral horses, and mowing as a type of "artificial grazing") on three barrier islands on the coast of Georgia, USA. The three grazing treatments differed in location, intensity, and type of herbivore. They all altered invertebrate community composition, but in different ways. Cattle grazing had the most negative impact on plant height, chlorophyll content, and leaf toughness, and on the density of invertebrates, while artificial grazing sometimes increased densities of planthoppers, herbivorous Chaetopsis spp. flies, and spiders. Although the responses to grazing of some plant traits and some invertebrate taxa were variable, plant height and katydid (Orchelimum fidicinium) density were consistently reduced by the three grazing types. In laboratory experiments, katydids (the easiest herbivore to work with in the laboratory) did not have a feeding preference for grazed versus ungrazed plants, but grew better on ungrazed plants. Our results indicate that moderate levels of grazing do not harm salt marsh invertebrates in this geographic area, and may even benefit some species. Heavy grazing, however, strongly suppresses both plants and marsh invertebrates. Future studies should evaluate both grazing intensity and the different responses of different invertebrate taxa to improve guidance to managers about vertebrate grazing in salt marshes.

AB  - Rewilding with locally extinct terrestrial vertebrates has been a popular conservation initiative over the past few decades. Among the animals used for rewilding are the small- to medium-sized vertebrates that forage in the soil and that have been lost from many ecosystems due to habitat destruction or predation by exotic species. Soil foraging by these animals creates surface depressions that generate resource-rich patches and novel niches. Thus, their reintroduction can have beneficial effects on both the biodiversity and functioning of the ecosystems they inhabit. An important knowledge gap, however, is the extent to which soil foraging by these animals might compromise ecosystem functioning if they reach extremely high densities in the absence of natural predators, such as occurs with the extensive soil disturbance by feral pigs. We performed a field experiment to test the effects of increasing soil disturbance and herbivory, and their interaction, on ecosystem functioning and the diversity of multiple taxa in a dry subhumid grassy woodland. Of the 106 possible attribute x treatment combinations assessed, we found only eight effects (three declines and five herbivory effects that varied depending on disturbance or community) in response to increasing levels of soil surface disturbance or herbivory. System-based modelling revealed that the greatest overall effects on our organisms were due to plants (plant richness, plant biomass, litter depth), with generally positive effects of plants on surface-active arthropods, negative effects on the whole metazoan community, and a negative litter effect, but only on microbes. Levels of disturbance (0-60%) and herbivory (0-100%) imposed in our treatments were greater than those observed under natural conditions. Our results suggest therefore that there are unlikely to be substantial negative impacts of reintroducing soil-foraging animals on biodiversity or ecosystem functioning in our target dry woodlands, even under potentially large levels of disturbance and herbivory.

AB  - Ungulate impacts on forest understory alter tree species composition, with cascading effects on forest functions and resilience against future climate conditions. Indeed, the ungulate browsing pressure on tree seedlings is species-specific and causes contrasted growth reductions that alter tree recruitment rates. Untangling the effects of browsing from the effects of the other factors driving regeneration success is required to guide the forest and ungulate management. In particular, Fagus sylvatica L. strongly dominates temperate Quercus-Fagus forests close to their climax, and it remains unclear if controlling ungulate populations can maintain tree species diversity in naturally regenerated forests. We addressed this question by monitoring 734 pairs of fenced and unfenced 6-m(2) plots across a broad gradient of Cervus elaphus L. abundance in Belgian Quercus-Fagus forests managed by continuous cover forestry. Seedling height, density, and vegetation cover were monitored from 2016 to 2021. Species diversity and ecological affinity for light, temperature, and atmospheric humidity conditions were computed from these measures. With ungulates, the mean growth of Betula pendula Roth. and Sorbus aucuparia L. was negligible, whereas, without ungulates, their growth was higher than the growth of other species. With ungulates, the growth of Fagus sylvatica L. and Picea abies (L.) H. Karst was higher than other species. Quercus (Quercus petreae (Matt.) Liebl and Quercus robur L.) growth was the lowest in all conditions. Finally, Carpinus betulus L. was heavily browsed but still grew higher than its competitors with ungulates. Ungulate browsing can then severely affect seedling growth and likely reduce the diversity of future recruited trees. In the study area, browsing unfavored the regeneration of the species that are less shade tolerant, more-drought tolerant, and more-heat tolerant. It thus accelerates the natural succession and reduces forest resilience to heat and drought events. Such an observation was found valid over a wide study area encompassing contrasting levels of Cervus elaphus L. abundance. Combining further reductions of ungulate populations with foodscape improvement is likely required to maintain species diversity in these forests.

AB  - After the domestication of goats around 10,000 years before the present (BP), humans transported goats far beyond the range of their wild ancestor, the bezoar goat. This brought domestic goats into contact with many wild goat species such as ibex and markhor, enabling introgression between domestic and wild goats. To investigate this, while shedding light on the taxonomic status of wild and domestic goats, we analysed genome-wide SNP data of 613 specimens from 14 taxonomic units, including Capra hircus, C. pyrenaica, C. ibex (from Switzerland, Austria, Germany and Slovenia), C. aegagrus aegagrus, C. a. cretica, C. h. dorcas, C. caucasica caucasica, C. c. severtzovi, C. c. cylindricornis, C. falconeri, C. sibirica sibirica, C. s. alaiana and C. nubiana, as well as Oreamnos americanus (mountain goat) as an outgroup. To trace gene flow between domestic and wild goats, we integrated genotype data of local goat breeds from the Alps as well as from countries such as Spain, Greece, Turkiye, Egypt, Sudan, Iran, Russia (Caucasus and Altai) and Pakistan. Our phylogenetic analyses displayed a clear separation between bezoar-type and ibex-type clades with wild goats from the Greek islands of Crete and Youra clustered within domestic goats, confirming their feral origin. Our analyses also revealed gene flow between the lineages of Caucasian tur and domestic goats that most likely occurred before or during early domestication. Within the clade of domestic goats, analyses inferred gene flow between African and Iberian goats. The detected events of introgression were consistent with previous reports and offered interesting insights into the historical relationships among domestic and wild goats.

AB  - Invasive herbivores that kill foundation tree species pose a major threat to forest ecosystem sustainability. One important foundation tree species in the interior western United States is quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), which is threatened by recent outbreaks of an invasive insect, oystershell scale (Lepidosaphes ulmi Linn.; OSS). OSS outbreaks were first reported in 2016, when OSS began causing dieback and mortality of aspen in wildland forest settings in northern Arizona. Since then, OSS has been observed in other locations across Arizona and in other western states, and recent studies in Arizona have highlighted the threat that OSS poses to aspen sustainability, warranting a comprehensive survey of OSS invasions and their impacts on aspen ecosystems. We sampled aspen populations across Arizona and addressed three questions: (1) What is the geographic extent of OSS in Arizona? (2) What impacts does OSS have on aspen? (3) Which biotic and abiotic factors influence the proportion of aspen stems infested by OSS? OSS was present in 29% of our 220 study plots and had a negative impact on aspen forest health. OSS was associated with crown damage and tree mortality, especially of intermediate-sized, recruiting stems. Climate was the most important driver of OSS infestation, with warmer, drier conditions resulting in significantly more OSS. OSS was also associated with less recent fire, presence of ungulate management strategies (e.g. fenced exclosures) and stands with a greater density of aspen saplings. We conclude by providing OSS monitoring and management recommendations, based on our findings, and emphasise that active management - such as prescribed fire, reduced reliance on ungulate exclosures or thinning - is required to suppress OSS populations and mitigate damage to aspen ecosystems.

AB  - Pectis imberbis is an endangered plant found in the Madrean Archipelago ecoregion of southern Arizona. Numerous, potentially interacting stressors, such as drought, shifting fire regimes, invasive species, and grazing by domesticated and wild ungulates, affect this species and region. We used Integral Projection Models (IPMs) to describe dynamics of the largest documented P. imberbis population. While collecting census data, we quantified impacts of species interacting with P. imberbis, including pollinators, Coues deer (Odocoileus virginianus couesi), and co-occurring vegetation, and evaluated their impact on P. imberbis population vital rates. Despite a large overall size (N= 794), the growth rate for this population was below replacement level (lambda= 0.9519). Browse by Coues deer negatively impacted demographic vital rates. Woody species and perennial grasses afforded protection against browse, especially for small individuals, but in the absence of browse, coincidence with heterospecific vegetation decreased growth, survival, and reproduction of P. imberbis. We observed 12 taxa of invertebrates interacting with P. imberbis flowers, including native bees, flies, and wasps. Seed production by bagged flowers indicated that flowers are self-compatible. In summary, we detected a unique interplay between deer, which negatively impacted P. imberbis populations via browse, and vegetation, which reduced incidence of browse, while simultaneously depressing P. imberbis vital rates when no browse occurred. Findings suggest that shifts in community dynamics, such as introduction of invasive grasses or fluctuations in deer populations, could impact P. imberbis population trajectories. Management actions, including exclusion of herbivores and removal of invasive grasses, should be considered to aid species recovery.

AB  - Feral horse (Equus ferus caballus) grazing can alter arid shrubland habitat in the western United States to the detriment of sympatric wildlife species, including the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). To date, studies of horse-influenced habitat alteration have only occurred in a few locations and have infrequently represented gradients of horse use. We investigated whether greater sage-grouse habitat quality metrics were negatively associated with feral horse use in southcentral Wyoming, USA. We also tested whether utilization distributions generated from feral horses tracked with global position system transmitters were correlated with dung pile density, our index of horse use. Dung pile density did not vary among utilization distribution levels, indicating utilization distributions were a poor predictor of cumulative horse use. Bare ground increased with dung pile density (beta = 0.06, 85% CI = 0.04-0.18), and grass height exhibited a threshold response and began to decline after 638 piles/ha. Other habitat metrics including percent shrub cover, native perennial grass cover, and visual obstruction were better explained by topographic and temporal variation. Our results suggest that herd size reduction may limit soil erosion potential and improve desired herbaceous structure, though additional management actions regarding feral horse use are needed to sustain high-quality greater sage-grouse habitat.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities may alter felid assemblage structure, facilitating the persistence of tolerant species (commonly mesopredators), excluding ecologically demanding ones (top predators) and, consequently, changing coexistence rules. We aimed to determine how human activities influence intraguild relationships among top predators and their cascading effects on mesopredators, which remain poorly understood despite evidence of top carnivore decline. We used structural equation modeling at a continental scale to investigate how habitat quality and quantity, livestock density, and other human pressures modified the intraguild relations of the 3 species that are at the top of the food chain in the Neotropics: jaguars (Panthera onca), pumas (Puma concolor), and ocelots (Leopardus pardalis). We included presence-absence data derived from systematic studies compiled in Neocarnivores data set for these felid species at 0.0833 degrees resolution. Human disturbance reduced the probability of jaguar occurrence by -0.35 standard deviations. Unexpectedly, the presence of sheep (Ovis aries) or goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) and jaguars was positively related to the presence of pumas, whereas puma presence was negatively related to the presence of ocelots. Extent of forest cover had more of an effect on jaguar (beta = 0.23) and ocelot (beta = 0.12) occurrences than the extent of protected area, which did not have a significant effect. The lack of effect of human activities on puma presence and the positive effect of small livestock supports the notion that pumas are more adaptable to habitat disturbance than jaguars. Our findings suggest that human disturbance has the potential to reverse the hierarchical competition dominance among large felids, leading to an unbalanced community structure. This shift disadvantages jaguars and elevates the position of pumas in the assemblage hierarchy, resulting in the exclusion of ocelots, despite their relatively lower susceptibility to anthropogenic disturbance. Our results suggest that conservation efforts should extend beyond protected areas to encompass the surrounding landscape, where complexities and potential conflicts are more pronounced.

AB  - Ecological models predict that the effects of mammalian herbivore exclusion on plant diversity depend on resource availability and plant exposure to ungulate grazing over evolutionary time. Using an experiment replicated in 57 grasslands on six continents, with contrasting evolutionary history of grazing, we tested how resources (mean annual precipitation and soil nutrients) determine herbivore exclusion effects on plant diversity, richness and evenness. Here we show that at sites with a long history of ungulate grazing, herbivore exclusion reduced plant diversity by reducing both richness and evenness and the responses of richness and diversity to herbivore exclusion decreased with mean annual precipitation. At sites with a short history of grazing, the effects of herbivore exclusion were not related to precipitation but differed for native and exotic plant richness. Thus, plant species' evolutionary history of grazing continues to shape the response of the world's grasslands to changing mammalian herbivory.
   A NutNet experiment in 57 grasslands across six continents shows that when herbivores are excluded from grasslands with a long coevolutionary history of grazing plant diversity is reduced, while in grasslands without a long grazing history the evolutionary history of the plant species regulates the response of plant diversity.

AB  - The Faroe Islands, an isolated North Atlantic archipelago, are characterized by a grassland vegetation, which is shaped by strong winds and, since human settlement, also by intensive sheep grazing. This study, conducted in August 2023, investigated terrestrial gastropod fauna across 46 sites on six islands: Vagar, Streymoy, Eysturoy, Kunoy, Boroy, and Vioy. We found 26 gastropod species, including two new species for the archipelago (Euconulus fulvus and Vertigo angustior). Several rare species were found at new locations, including Lauria cylindracea, previously only known from a single site on Suuoy, now documented at two additional sites on Vagar and Streymoy. Species richness at the sites varied between 1 and 16 species, with an average of five species. The fauna is notably slug-dominated, as on average more slug species were found at a site than snail species. Our results illustrate the effects of overgrazing by sheep, which limits gastropod diversity to refuges such as steep rocky outcrops, tall riparian vegetation in narrow canyons, and less disturbed wetlands. The snail fauna of the Faroes is relatively species-poor (31 species in total) and is dominated by introduced generalists and non-native slugs, while micro-snails, which are common in other insular areas with similar climates, are notably absent.

AB  - Arctic ecosystems are warming nearly 4 times faster than the global average, which is resulting in plant community shifts and subsequent changes in biogeochemical processes such as gaseous fluxes. Additionally, herbivores shape plant communities and thereby may alter the magnitude and composition of ecosystem respiration and biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions. Here we determine the effect of large mammalian herbivores on ecosystem respiration and BVOC emissions in two southern and two northern sites in Swedish Scandes, encompassing mountain birch (LOMB) and shrub heath (LORI) communities in the south and low-herb meadow (RIGA) and shrub heath (RIRI) communities in the north. Herbivory significantly altered BVOC composition between sites and decreased ecosystem respiration at RIGA. The difference in graminoid cover was found to have a large effect on ecosystem respiration between sites as RIGA, with the highest cover, had 35% higher emissions than the next highestemitting site (LOMB). Additionally, LOMB had the highest emissions of terpenes, with the northern sites having significantly lower emissions. Differences between sites were primarily due to differences in exclosure effects and soil temperature and the prevalence of different shrub growth forms. Our results suggest that herbivory has a significant effect on trace gas fluxes in a productive meadow community and that differences between communities may be driven by differences in shrub composition.

AB  - Exclosure cages are often used for estimating biomass accumulation on continuously stocked pastures in grazing experiments. The microclimate inside the cages may affect the estimates of biomass accumulation, but this has not been previously identified or quantified. We evaluated how the exclusion from grazing for 21 days in Mulato II brachiariagrass (Brachiaria brizantha x Brachiaria decumbens x Brachiaria ruziziensis) pastures affected canopy air temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) and how this related to biomass accumulation. We also evaluated the effect of the exclosure cage on wind speed (WS) and incoming solar radiation (SR), and how these impacted evapotranspiration (ET) and estimates of biomass accumulation on grazed canopies maintained at 20- and 30-cm height under continuous stocking. Regardless of canopy height, changes in canopy structure during the exclusion period up to 21 days did not affect T and RH (averages of 24.3 degrees C and 88.7%, respectively), indicating that the air circulation was not affected by the exclusion. The cage structure reduced SR by 5%, although there were times during clear days when SR was slightly greater inside the cage than outside. The cage also reduced WS by 4.4%. Smaller SR and WS resulted in less ET inside the cages than outside, although with close values (2.9 vs. 3.0 mm day(-1); P = 0.0494). The biomass accumulation rate was greater inside than outside the cages for both canopy heights. This overestimation would be 5.8 and 9.7% greater if the structure of the cage did not reduce the SR, WS, and ET.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities such as cattle grazing and forest clearing have led to the establishment of early successional grass layers in some native forests, which may inhibit or entirely prevent native tree regeneration. We hypothesize that increased grass coverage reduces or eliminates the establishment of native tree seedlings by limiting water availability to seeds and seedlings. This study aims to evaluate the impact of grass cover on tree seedling survival under varying levels of soil water stress. We conducted a field experiment using 36 experimental exclosures in two northwest Patagonian valleys, representing a regional gradient in altitude, rainfall, and tree canopy openness. Additionally, a greenhouse experiment was performed with 36 pots, manipulating four levels of grass cover and three levels of water stress. Results from both experiments showed similarities: in the field, the likelihood of finding a live tree seedling was approximately 2.78 times higher in areas without grass compared with grass-covered sites. In the greenhouse, the presence of grass reduced the final number of established seedlings by an average of 43% across all irrigation levels, indicating significant water competition. These findings suggest that management practices promoting grass invasion could severely hinder tree regeneration in forests not adapted to large herbivore intensive grazing. Such situation may be exacerbated in regions suffering water limitation in the growing season or where the climate change would intensify water stress.

AB  - Over a quarter of the world's land surface is grazed by cattle and other livestock, which are replacing wild herbivores and widely regarded as drivers of global biodiversity declines. The effects of livestock presence versus absence on wild herbivores are well documented. However, the environmental context-specific effects of cattle stocking rate on biodiversity and livestock production are poorly understood, precluding nuanced rangeland management recommendations. To address this, we used a long term exclosure experiment in a semi-arid savanna ecosystem in central Kenya that selectively excludes cattle (at different stocking rates), wild mesoherbivores, and megaherbivores. We investigated the individual and interactive effects of cattle stocking rate (zero/moderate/high) and megaherbivore (>1,000 kg) accessibility on habitat use (measured as dung density) by two dominant wild mesoherbivores (50-1,000 kg; zebra Equus quagga and eland Taurotragus oryx) across the "wet" and "dry" seasons. To explore potential tradeoffs or co-benefits between cattle production and wildlife conservation, we tested for individual and interactive effects of cattle stocking rate and accessibility by wild mesoherbivores and megaherbivores (collectively, large wild herbivores) on the foraging efficiency of cattle across both seasons. Eland habitat use was reduced by cattle at moderate and high stocking rates across both dry and wet seasons and regardless of megaherbivore accessibility. We observed a positive effect of megaherbivores on zebra habitat use at moderate, but not high, stocking rates. Cattle foraging efficiency (g dry matter step(-1) min(-1)) was lower in the high compared to moderate stocking rate treatments during the dry season, and was non-additively reduced by wild mesoherbivores and high cattle stocking rates during the wet season. These results show that high stocking rates are detrimental to wild mesoherbivore habitat use and cattle foraging efficiency, while reducing to moderate stocking rates can benefit zebra habitat use and cattle foraging efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that ecosystem management and restoration efforts across African rangelands that involve reducing cattle stocking rates may represent a win-win for wild herbivore conservation and individual performance of livestock.

AB  - Maintaining ecosystem processes within patches of remnant vegetation is critical to minimising biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes. Foundation species-habitat-forming organisms that interact with many other species-are therefore a priority for conservation and restoration in farming areas. Triodia spp. grasses are foundation species of arid and semi-arid Australia that largely depend on fire for recruitment, but fire is suppressed or excluded in many agricultural areas. We tested the effectiveness of controlled burns and competitor removal (exotic and native grasses), both in isolation and combined, on recruitment rates of Triodia scariosa in remnant vegetation using a before-after, control-impact study across 126 plots. A subset of plots were located in an herbivore exclusion area inside a reserve. There was no recruitment of T. scariosa 1 year after burning, regardless of treatment or control, and the burns killed all existing plants. However, T. scariosa germinated by 2 years post-burn, with the greatest recruitment in sites where both burning and grass removal were applied. Two years after burning, T. scariosa abundance (adults and recruits) remained low outside reserves, but returned to original levels in reserves and in areas where large herbivores were excluded. Synthesis and applications. Despite failing to increase overall abundance, we show that restoration of a foundation plant species in degraded, agricultural landscapes can be achieved through a combination of fire reintroduction and competitor suppression. Germination trials from soil samples suggest a depleted seed bank limited recruitment rates, and therefore emphasise the importance of carefully timing restoration actions to overcome recruitment bottlenecks.

AB  - Resilience of plant communities to disturbance is supported by multiple mechanisms, including ecological legacies affecting propagule availability, species' environmental tolerances, and biotic interactions. Understanding the relative importance of these mechanisms for plant community resilience supports predictions of where and how resilience will be altered with disturbance. We tested mechanisms underlying resilience of forests dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana) to fire disturbance across a heterogeneous forest landscape in the Northwest Territories, Canada. We combined surveys of naturally regenerating seedlings at 219 burned plots with experimental manipulations of ecological legacies via seed addition of four tree species and vertebrate exclosures to limit granivory and herbivory at 30 plots varying in moisture and fire severity. Black spruce recovery was greatest where it dominated pre-fire, at wet sites with deep residual soil organic layers, and fire conditions of low soil or canopy combustion and longer return intervals. Experimental addition of seed indicated all species were seed-limited, emphasizing the importance of propagule legacies. Black spruce and birch (Betula papyrifera) recruitment were enhanced with vertebrate exclusion. Our combination of observational and experimental studies demonstrates black spruce is vulnerable to effects of increased fire activity that erode ecological legacies. Moreover, black spruce relies on wet areas with deep soil organic layers where other species are less competitive. However, other species can colonize these areas if enough seed is available or soil moisture is altered by climate change. Testing mechanisms underlying species' resilience to disturbance aids predictions of where vegetation will transform with effects of climate change.

AB  - Arid steppe rangelands in North Africa are highly significant ecosystems that are exceedingly sensitive to global warming and are also influenced by severe grazing and heavy utilization practices. Consequently, it is imperative to conduct extensive investigations regarding the impact of overgrazing due to increased sheep populations on plant diversity in these regions. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of two grazing managements (grazing-excluded vs. free-grazing) on floristic diversity in the arid steppe rangelands of North Africa. Sampling encompassed 10 sites, with 5 freely accessible to livestock and 5 protected from grazing. Within each site, three 200-m transects were established to survey and quantify plant species abundance. Alpha (species richness and diversity) and beta (qualitative and quantitative similarity analysis) biodiversity parameters were evaluated at both small and large spatial scales. The findings demonstrated a substantial disparity in plant diversity between grazing-excluded rangelands and free-grazed rangelands. Plant community diversity and stability parameters were notably higher in grazing-excluded areas. The taxonomic structure of plant communities also exhibited greater stability in grazing-excluded steppe areas. Specifically, the grazing-excluded sites displayed superior diversity metrics, including species richness (93), Shannon index (3.2), and Simpson reciprocal index (5.5), in comparison to severely grazed sites (61, 2.6, and 4.4), respectively). The influence of severe grazing had a more pronounced effect on ephemeral species rather than perennials, emphasizing the heightened vulnerability of these plants to overgrazing effect or inadequate grassland management practices. This effect coincided with heterogeneity in floristic composition between sites with free continuous livestock access and those protected from grazing. Furthermore, analysis of similarity at different spatial scales revealed an increase in diversity at small scales contrasted with a decrease at larger scales. Grazing exerted discernible effects on floristic composition, particularly affecting ephemeral species, albeit primarily at small scales. At larger scales, the impact of grazing was not detected. These findings underscore the complex relationship between grazing practices and plant diversity dynamics in arid steppe ecosystems, emphasizing the importance of sustainable management strategies to preserve biodiversity in these vulnerable habitats.

AB  - Removing exotic vertebrates from islands is an increasingly common and potentially effective strategy for protecting biodiversity. Yet, surprisingly few studies evaluate large-scale effects of island removals on native plants. We surveyed 431 hectares of habitat in 7 canyons on Santa Rosa Island just after exotic herbivore control began (1994-1996), and again after two herbivore species had been eradicated and similar to 90% of herbivores removed (2010-2012). We searched for 68 endemic and/or rare native plant taxa, mapping and recording abundances for the 39 found. Initially most of these 39 species were absent from most canyons (79.9% species-canyon combinations). Nearly 35% of absences changed to presences by 2010-2012, while only 5.5% of presences changed to absences. Thirty-six of these 39 species increased in total area, and 38 increased in total abundance. Graminoids increased more and shrubs less than other life histories, for both apparent colonizations and abundances. Beta diversity and species turnover between canyons was high at both surveys. Although a diversity of the 39 located taxa showed substantial gains, nearly half remained uncommon in 2010-2012. These results reinforce the devastating effects of exotic vertebrate herbivores on island native plants, particularly long-lived, slow-growing species. They also demonstrate significant potential benefits of exotic herbivore removal even without other active restoration, not only for vegetative cover but for a number of rare taxa. Our surveys were more spatially extensive than most post-removal studies; high spatial turnover in these data suggests that larger-scale monitoring may be critical to capture full effects of exotic animal removal.

AB  - A major component of Earth's dry surface is human-managed grassland, making the relationships among management actions, grassland biodiversity and ecosystem services of great ecological interest. Common management practices-fertiliser addition and large herbivore grazing-influence grassland diversity and productivity. The Nutrient Network, a distributed research effort, investigates these relationships across grasslands at a global scale. The Burren contains internationally important grasslands with high biodiversity maintained by traditional farming practices. Using six years of data from the Slieve Carran Nutrient Network site, we examine the effects of fertilisation and large mammal herbivory on plant diversity and biomass in a unique Irish context. We find 1) fertiliser addition and herbivore exclusion both decrease diversity and increase biomass, and 2) independent of our experimental treatments, biomass increased throughout the study. Our findings on treatment effects align with results from the wider Nutrient Network experiment. Additionally, the increase in biomass during the study is consistent with an abandonment effect. This research shows twin pressures of agricultural intensification and abandonment of traditional management practises detrimentally impact Burren grassland biodiversity.This is relevant to future management decisions, as biodiversity provides key ecosystem services in the Burren, including supporting tourism that contributes to local economies.

AB  - The loss of species from ecosystems can have cascading impacts on species interactions and ecosystem function. Australia has experienced the greatest loss of mammals globally in the past 200 years, but we know little of how the loss of this suite of ecosystem engineers and herbivores has affected vegetation. We used a threatened mammal reintroduction sanctuary to investigate effects of ecologically extinct mammals on plant assemblages. First, we tested the net effects of mammals using a long-term exclusion experiment within the sanctuary. Second, we used a three-year disturbance experiment to determine the relative roles of herbivory and physical disturbance in driving changes in plant assemblages. Third, we compared outcomes inside and outside the sanctuary to determine how effects of reintroduced mammals differed from contemporary mammal assemblages. Plant species richness was greatest in mammal exclusion plots and declined across all treatments from 2011 to 2018, probably due to drought. Plant composition changed in response to mammal exclusion, with six species increasing significantly, shrubs and myrmecochorous plants becoming more common and large-seeded species less common. Responses to experimental disturbance were less clear. Grass and resprouters were more common, and palatable and large-seeded plants were less common outside the sanctuary (exposed to contemporary mammal assemblage). Our study shows that reintroductions of ecologically extinct mammals have substantial impacts on plant assemblages, both through ecosystem engineering and herbivory, and these impacts differ from those of contemporary mammal faunas, suggesting that pre-European Australian ecosystems were markedly different from contemporary ecosystems.

AB  - Non-native ungulates (sheep, goats, and pigs) have significant negative impacts on ecosystem biodiversity, structure, and biogeochemical function throughout the Pacific Islands. Elevated nitrogen (N) availability associated with ungulate disturbance has been shown to promote the success of resource-exploitive invasive plants. While ungulate removal is a common restoration intervention, evaluations of its efficacy typically focus on vegetation responses, rather than underlying nutrient cycling. We used multiple chronosequences of ungulate exclusion (10-24 years duration) in three Hawaiian ecosystems (montane wet forest, dry forest, and dry shrubland) to determine N cycle recovery by characterizing gross mineralization and nitrification, soil inorganic N concentrations and leaching, N2O emissions, and plant tissue delta 15N. Ungulate removal led to a 1-2 parts per thousand decline in foliar delta 15N in most species, consistent with a long-term decrease in N fractionation via ecosystem N losses, or a shift in the relative turnover of N forms. This interpretation was supported by significant (dry forest) or trending (wet forest) increases in mineralization and decreases in nitrification, but conflicts with lack of observed change in inorganic N pool sizes or gaseous losses, and increased leaching in the dry forest. While results could indicate that ungulate invasions do not strongly impact N cycling in the first place (no uninvaded control sites exist in Hawai'i to test this hypothesis), this would be inconsistent with observations from other sites globally. Instead, impacts may be spatially patchy across the landscape, or ungulate invasions (possibly in combination with other disturbances) may have permanently shifted biogeochemical function or decoupled elemental cycles. We conclude that eliminating ungulate disturbance alone may not achieve restoration goals related to N cycling within the timeframe examined here.

AB  - Halting biological invasions and rewilding extirpated native fauna are conservation interventions to bolster biodiversity, species interactions, and ecosystems. These actions are often considered separately and the potential for reintroduced wildlife to facilitate invasive plants has been largely overlooked. Here, we investigated the role of Singapore's recolonizing native wild pigs (Sus scrofa) in facilitating an invasive weed Miconia crenata into tropical rainforests, which are normally highly resistant to invasion. We conducted line-transect surveys in 11 Singaporean rain forests and used generalized linear mixed models to consider the contribution of pigs' soil disturbances, human forest paths, and other environmental covariates, on the density of M. crenata. We found that M. crenata was more abundant at forest edges and invasion into forest interior was facilitated by pigs, paths, and canopy gaps, but that these effects were all additive, not synergistic (i.e., not multiplicative). These results highlight how modern invasions are driven by multiple disturbances as well as propagule pressure (e.g., urban birds dispersing seeds at forest edges where they establish in pig soil disturbances). Singapore's extensive native forest restoration efforts may have provided plentiful edge and secondary forests that are well suited to pigs and M. crenata, which in turn undermine the aims of fostering later-successional native plant communities. To prevent negative externalities, we suggest that plant restoration and rewilding projects consider the potential role of wildlife in facilitating non-native plants, and couple these actions with preliminary screening of unintended consequences and continued monitoring, as well as limiting human-mediated weed invasion to minimize propagule sources.

AB  - Rice is widely consumed as a staple food, being cultivated worldwide. However, in West Africa, production is not enough to satisfy demand. Rice often suffers intensive damage by herbivorous arthropods that affect quality and quantity of the grain. Birds and bats have been shown to suppress arthropod pests, potentially enhancing rice productivity and food security. However, the degree to which these taxa provide nature-based solutions for mitigating pest-induced rice losses is poorly known, especially in West Africa. Here, we used experimental exclosures to investigate whether birds and bats reduce plant damage and boost rice yield by suppressing arthropod abundance. In a rural area in northern Guinea-Bissau, we established 14 sets of paired control and experimental exclosures parcels, precluding access of birds and bats to rice plants. We then quantified how the absence of birds and bats influenced arthropod communities, plant damage, and rice yield over a full rice production cycle (six months). Arthropod numbers in exclosures (10.1 +/- 9.1 ind./plot) were nearly double those in control plots (5.8 +/- 3.0 ind./plot), a result mostly due to a lower spider abundance in the controls. The percentage of leaf and grain damage showed no difference between exclosure and control. Using Structural Equation Models, we uncovered that the exclusion of birds and bats boosted arthropod abundance but had only marginal effects on rice damage and no detectable effect on yield. The exclusion of flying vertebrates led to a marked increase in spider abundance, suggesting an effect of mesopredator release, which in turn likely helped maintaining pest abundance low and potentially contributing to the small overall effect on rice damage and yield. Enhancing the abundance of birds and bats is an interesting option to suppress agricultural pests, but our results highlight the need for a better understanding of ecological interactions in agricultural landscapes in West Africa. We stress the need for more research to inform evidence-based policies using nature-based solutions that foster the natural consumption of pests by vertebrates, as a means to improve food security.

AB  - Fungal endophytes may alter plant responses to the environment, but how does the environment affect the communities of fungal symbionts within plants? We examined the impact of nutrient addition and herbivore exclusion on endophyte communities of the prairie grass Andropogon gerardii in a full factorial field experiment. Fungi were cultured from stems, young leaves, and mature leaves, ITS sequences obtained, and endophyte incidence, community richness, and composition analyzed. Results indicate that in plots where nutrient addition and herbivore exclusion treatments had been applied separately, fungal endophyte incidence, community composition or evenness did not differ, but that greater species richness was observed in plots with nutrient addition and herbivore exclusion treatments applied in combination, compared to other treatments. Further, although fungal community composition was significantly different in stem and leaf tissues, OTU richness was greater in all endophyte communities in nutrient addition plus herbivore exclusion treatments, regardless of tissue type. Our results indicate the distinct fungal endophyte communities found in different plant tissues respond similarly to environmental factors.

AB  - Mediterranean landscapes are characterized by fine-grained land-cover mosaics of interspersed vegetation types and high wildfire vulnerability, where grazing plays a key role in regulating vegetation structure and composition. This study explores the early effects, over a three-year period, of a transition from extensive commercial cattle grazing to semi-wild horse grazing in two rewilding areas in the C & ocirc;a Valley region, Portugal. Using grazing exclusion areas as control, we test whether the less intensive regime of semi-wild horse grazing can be used to manage vegetation structure and composition, to mitigate local fire hazard and promote biodiversity. The monitoring scheme followed a paired design, where each survey site of 40 m x 40 m comprises four sampling plots of 10 m x 10 m, including two fenced plots (grazing exclusion) and two plots open to grazing. Effects on vegetation structure were assessed considering grass height, shrub height, shrub cover and aboveground biomass, as well as effects on plant species richness, turnover, and forbs-to-grasses ratio (F:G ratio) and the community-level importance of grasses and forbs. Results showed that grass height had a greater increase in ungrazed plots, suggesting that semi-wild horse grazing helps limit grass height. There were no significant differences in shrub metrics between treatments (i.e. horse grazing vs. no grazing), indicating that horse grazing did not effectively control woody vegetation. While species richness remained stable, species temporal turnover was higher in ungrazed plots. Additionally, the F:G ratio and the importance value of forbs were higher under horse grazing, suggesting potential benefits for anthophilous insects. These findings indicate that semi-wild horse grazing contributes to maintaining open habitats by controlling grass dominance, thereby reducing local fire hazard and potentially fostering habitat and food resources for insects. While this demonstrates the potential of using semi-wild horse grazing in rewilding, the results also suggest that horses alone, particularly at low densities, have limited impact on woody vegetation structure.

AB  - Overabundant deer populations can cause severe ecological impacts. To inform management decisions and assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, land managers require a rapid and cost-effective method for collecting data on both deer density and impacts. Here, we describe a field method for rapidly and concurrently assessing indices of deer density and impacts in forested habitats, and using field data collected in 2019-2020, we demonstrate its performance. The method combines commonly used protocols for surveying deer faecal pellets, vegetation impact and floristic attributes, without relying on indicator species. The survey involves assessment of 150-m transects in forested habitats along which 30 plots are surveyed for faecal pellets of deer and sympatric herbivores (here, Swamp Wallaby, Wallabia bicolor), and impacts on woody trees and shrubs at different heights. In total, we surveyed 154 transects comprising 15,941 plant impact assessments and assessed the methods performance using basic and comparative statistics, and power analyses. Almost all plant species were similarly impacted at the local (transect) level. Indices of deer and Swamp Wallaby density explained similar amounts of variance in impacts <1 m, while the deer index explained much more of the variance in impacts >1 m. We detected differences in vegetation impact and other floristic attributes between four locations surveyed in 2020 from a modest sample size (23-24 transects). The method is simple to implement and can be applied in a wide range of forest types. In comparison to alternatives (e.g. fenced exclosures), this method presents a rapid and cost-effective means of collecting information on deer density and impacts, and detecting large differences in impact. We suggest that the proposed method enables rapid landscape-scale assessments of deer impacts suitable for evaluating management interventions.

AB  - The use of mixed forests and non-native tree species have the potential to mitigate climate change impacts and enhance biodiversity. However, little is known about how forest composition and environmental factors affect each step of natural regeneration in mixed forests, especially in mixtures with non-native trees. Here we investigated how forest composition affected European beech seed survival (through seed tracking), seed sprouting (via field germination experiments), and seedling survival (monthly seedling monitoring) in pure beech forests and in admixtures with Norway spruce and the introduced Douglas-fir in a mast and non-mast year of beech. We also assessed how biotic and abiotic factors (small mammal abundance, ungulate access, seed production, seed burial, canopy cover, distance to nearest adult tree, seedling aggregation, understory density, browsing damage, and soil properties) affected these regeneration dynamics. Seed survival was negatively affected by the presence of conifers and mouse abundance. Seed germination was influenced by whether seeds were buried or not. Seedling survival increased in Douglas-fir admixtures, and in forests with higher soil quality. Browsing damage and ungulate access diminished seedling survival. Seed production had the greatest influence on absolute number of seedlings. Forest composition and environmental factors had distinct impacts on regeneration of beech depending on its ontogenetic stage. Here, we provide evidence supporting the notion that Douglas-fir is not impairing the regeneration of native trees in mixed forests. In fact, mixtures with Douglas-fir benefited the survival of beech seedlings, likely due to better soil properties and less damage from herbivores on these stands.

AB  - Grassy vegetation is widely spread across Southeast Asia, yet very little data exists describing the diversity in these plant communities. Groundlayer diversity data is especially rare, with previous studies focussing on woody plants. Research in grassy ecosystems worldwide suggest that there are substantial differences in grassland community composition across climate aridity gradients, which are aligned with a switch from strong disturbance by fire in wetter sites to disturbance by mammalian herbivory in drier sites. The aim of this investigation was to record the groundlayer diversity of grasslands found in northern Sumatra Island, Indonesia, and to determine whether that diversity was structured fire and mammalian herbivory. We sampled ten 50 m x 50 m vegetation plots in grassy vegetation across an aridity gradient, with soil data and grazing pressure data collected on site, and climate and fire frequency data compiled from geographic resources. We classified all species according to two morphological characteristics that related to plant evolution under fire and herbivory, namely stem form and leaf placement. We recorded 89 groundlayer species across all plots, with an average of 29 species per plot. Our analysis confirmed that the strongest axis of community differentiation was with respect to the fire-grazing trade-off axis, which selected for specific adaptive stem and leaf placement morphologies. The groundlayer diversity of grasslands in northern Sumatra is closely related to other monsoonal regions of Southeast Asia, likely reflecting grassland connectivity during the last ice age. The abundance of disturbance-adapted species suggests appropriate use of fire and herbivory will be necessary to sustain these communities.

AB  - Background The data we present are part of the AGRO-ECOSERVICES project (Assessing ecosystem services and disservices provided by arthropod species in Azorean agroecosystems). The project aims to evaluate the relative importance of native and non-native organisms as ecosystem services (ES) and disservices (ED) providers, by combining novel, direct and quantitative tools for monitoring agro-biodiversity. Ecosystem services include evaluation of natural pest control by predation, seed predation on weed plants, pollination, decomposition and ecosystem disservices, herbivory and seed predation on crop plants. Active Aerial Searching (AAS) (only in maize-fields) and pitfall traps were used to sample the arthropod biodiversity (predatory spiders, true-bugs and beetles and main insect pests) on four agricultural habitats of Terceira Island, namely citrus orchards, low and high elevation maize fields and vineyards. New information We provided an inventory of all arthropods recorded in four Azorean agroecosystems (citrus orchards, low and high elevation maize fields and vineyards) from Terceira Island. A total of 50412 specimens were collected, belonging to four classes, 20 orders, 81 families and 200 identified species of arthropods. A total of 127 species are considered introduced (n = 22646) and 69 native non-endemic (n = 24117). Four endemic species were recorded with very few specimens (n = 14) and 3635 specimens belong to unidentified taxa recorded only at genus or family level. Five species are new records for Terceira Island, with Lagria hirta (Linnaeus, 1758) (Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae) being also a new record for the Azores. This publication contributes to a better knowledge of the arthropods communities present in agro-ecosystems of Terceira Island and will serve as a baseline for future monitoring schemes targeting the long-term change in arthropod diversity and abundance.

AB  - The overpopulation of large herbivorous mammals degrades understory vegetation and hence promotes soil erosion in some northern hemisphere forests. Topsoil removal via erosion reduces soil water and nitrogen (N) content as well as exposes tree roots. However, whether topsoil removal inhibits tree growth through water and N uptake limitations has not been examined. This study aimed to measure the vertical length from exposed roots surface to the soil surface (exposed root height; ERH) under degraded forest understory vegetation and to evaluate its influence on tree growth. Specifically, we examined the relationships between ERH and beech growth and identified the timing of growth reduction based on annual tree-ring analysis at the individual scale. Furthermore, we discussed the effects of water and N limitations on beech growth reduction. We studied 12 Japanese beech trees on Mt. Sanpo, southern Kyushu Island, Japan, where understory vegetation was degraded and lost due to herbivory by Japanese sika deer from 1980 to 2003. Lower amounts of leaf production and relative growth rates of stem basal area increment (BAI) were observed in beech trees with higher ERH. Segmented regression analysis, which detects the changing time of a temporal trend (i.e., break-point), revealed that the BAI has resulted in a decreasing trend after 1997.6 +/- 9.0 (yr), which coincided with the field obser-vations on understory degradation in the study site. After the break-point of the BAI, the BAI of each study tree was negatively related to intrinsic water use efficiency, an integrated index of water limitation. These results suggest that soil erosion after the degradation of understory vegetation reduced beech growth, possibly because of the water limitations associated with root exposure. Reduced beech growth will reduce the supply of the litter layer that prevents topsoil erosion, which may enhance further soil erosion and tree growth reduction.

AB  - In the actual context of global change and biodiversity depletion, soil bioengineering represents an important tool for riparian ecosystem restoration and species conservation. Various techniques have already been implemented, but their adaptation still must be carried out in Caribbean Islands biodiversity hotspots, where suitable species remains unknown. Nitrogen-fixing legumes are particularly relevant for ecological restoration and the diversity of native Caribbean legume trees is promising in the search for suitable species for soil bioengineering. We hypothesized that Caribbean legume tree species present a growth performance and set of biotechnical traits compatible with their use in soil bioengineering. We selected five native legume trees, adapted to riparian environments, in different ecosystems (swamp forest, evergreen seasonal forest, rainforest) based on their ecology, resistance to disturbance and seed production characteristics. We measured root traits relevant for soil bioengineering on nursery grown 3-month-old seedlings. Despite their differences in sensitivity to herbivory and in growth strategies, the selected species have a high potential for use in soil bioengineering, with high seed production, high germination rates-from 88 to 100%-, and 100% survival rates, and are therefore compatible with large scale plant material production. We provided practical guidance tools for their integration into soil bioengineering techniques.

AB  - 1. Climate change is generating extreme climate events, affecting ecosystem integrity and function directly through increases in abiotic stress and disturbance and indirectly through changes in the strength of biotic interactions. As consumers play an essential role in ecosystem functioning and have been shown to be highly sensitive to climate conditions, improved understanding of their role under changing environmental conditions is necessary to accurately anticipate climate change impacts on ecosystem integrity.
   2. We evaluated if prolonged periods of extreme rain, a climatic event increasing in severity in many places around the world, and coincident increases in coastal flooding duration intensify consumer control of foundational salt marsh grass structure and quantify the consequences of flooding-consumer interactions on salt marsh range extent. To achieve this, we analysed: historic trends in crab grazing; crab numbers and activity in and out of rainy years on the low marsh edge; vegetation retreat from the low marsh edge at a plot scale in a manipulative exclosure experiment; vegetation retreat at a landscape-scale from drone image analyses; and the vertical erosion in the lowest edge of an Argentinean salt marsh.
   3. During flooded periods, crabs congregated in the low marsh, resulting in localized overgrazing of salt marsh grass and the rapid horizontal retreat of the marsh edge (98.5 cm on average). Salt marsh edge retreat resulted in a loss of similar to 4.5% of the total marsh area at the landscape scale. Inside crab exclusion plots, although grass cover declined slightly during the study period, the marsh edge did not retreat.
   4. Synthesis. This study provides experimental evidence that an extreme climate event can destabilize a local consumer-prey interaction, indirectly triggering the range contraction of a critical coastal habitat. This work contributes to a growing body of research demonstrating that consumers can be unleashed, rather than suppressed, by extreme climatic events. Moreover, in cases where consumer fronts form during such events, the result can be not only local (along habitat edges) but also landscape-scale extinction of foundation species and the habitats they biogenically create. Together, this supports the general idea that models of future climate scenarios integrate the indirect effects on ecosystem-regulating food web interactions.

AB  - Natural enemies play an important role in controlling plant population growth and vegetation dynamics. Tropical rainforests host the greatest diversity of herbivores, from large mammalian ungulates to microscopic pathogens, generating and maintaining plant diversity. By feeding on the same resources, large mammalian herbivores may interfere with plant consumption and leaf damage by important enemy guilds such as invertebrate herbivores and pathogens, triggering indirect trophic cascades. However, the impact of local extinctions of large herbivores on plant-enemy interactions is relatively unknown. We experimentally tested the effects of defaunation of large mammalian herbivores (e.g. peccaries, tapirs and brocket deer; hereafter, large herbivores) on the leaf damage of 3350 understorey plants in tropical rainforests of Brazil. We examined leaf damage in 10,050 leaves from 333 morphospecies by assigning the area consumed or damaged by five guilds of insect herbivores and leaf pathogens within 86 paired open-closed plots and investigating the joint effects of defaunation and plant phylogenetic diversity. Plants released from large herbivores had 9% less leaf damage; this difference was due to the lower leaf pathogens incidence (29%) rather than insect herbivory. Evolutionary distinctness was positively correlated with leaf damage in a similar way in all treatments, suggesting additive effects of defaunation and phylogenetic diversity. Total and pathogenic leaf damage (but not insect damage) decreased with plant richness across treatments, and large herbivores exclusion resulted in increased plant species richness. This suggests that large herbivores exclusion leads to a dilution of total and pathogens' leaf damage by increasing plant species richness. Our results suggest that indirect effects of large herbivores decrease the dilution potential of plant communities against pathogens and rather reinforce their top-down impact on vegetation, demonstrating a previously overlooked cascading effect of large herbivore extinction on forest ecosystems. Synthesis: The extinction of large mammalian herbivores can lead to a decrease in pathogen-driven leaf damage, a previously unknown indirect effect in forest ecosystems, which might have consequences for plant fitness and ultimately for plant diversity. Large herbivores and plant pathogens might have synergistic effects in regulating the diversity of plant communities in some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth.
   Os inimigos naturais desempenham um papel importante no controle do crescimento das populacoes de plantas e na dinamica vegetal. As florestas tropicais abrigam a maior diversidade de herbivoros do planeta, desde grandes mamiferos ungulados ate patogenos microscopicos, gerando e mantendo a diversidade vegetal. Ao se alimentar dos mesmos recursos que insetos e patogenos, os grandes mamiferos herbivoros podem interferir no consumo de plantas e nos danos as folhas causados por guildas inimigas, tais como herbivoros invertebrados e patogenos, desencadeando efeitos indiretos em cascatas troficas. Entretanto, o impacto das extincoes locais dos grandes herbivoros nas interacoes entre plantas e seus distintos inimigos naturais e pouco conhecido. Testamos experimentalmente os efeitos da defaunacao de grandes mamiferos herbivoros (por exemplo, queixadas, antas e veados-catingueiros; daqui em diante chamados 'grandes herbivoros') nos danos foliares de 3.350 plantas de sub-bosque em florestas tropicais do Brasil. Examinamos os danos foliares em 10.050 folhas de 333 morfoespecies, atribuindo a area consumida ou danificada a cinco guildas de insetos herbivoros e patogenos foliares em 86 parcelas pareadas (abertas e fechadas) e investigamos os efeitos conjuntos da defaunacao e da diversidade filogenetica das plantas. As plantas nao expostas aos grandes herbivoros apresentaram 9% a menos de danos foliares, sendo essa diferenca atribuida a menor incidencia de patogenos foliares (29%) e nao a herbivoria por insetos. A Distincao Evolutiva das plantas se correlacionou positivamente com os danos foliares e de maneira semelhante em todos os tratamentos, sugerindo efeitos aditivos da defaunacao e da diversidade filogenetica. Os danos foliares totais e patogenicos (mas nao os danos por insetos) diminuiram com a riqueza de plantas entre os tratamentos e a exclusao de grandes herbivoros resultou no aumento da riqueza de especies de plantas. Esse fato sugere que a exclusao de grandes herbivoros leva a uma diluicao dos danos foliares totais e causados por patogenos atraves de um efeito indireto mediado pela riqueza de especies de plantas. Nossos resultados sugerem que os efeitos indiretos dos grandes herbivoros diminuem o potencial de diluicao das comunidades vegetais contra os patogenos e reforcam o seu papel de controladores 'de topo' na vegetacao, demonstrando um efeito cascata anteriormente negligenciado da extincao de grandes herbivoros nos ecossistemas florestais (tropicais). Sintese: A extincao de grandes mamiferos herbivoros pode levar a uma diminuicao dos danos foliares causados por patogenos, um efeito indireto ate entao desconhecido nos ecossistemas florestais, que pode ter consequencias para a aptidao das plantas e, em ultima instancia, para a diversidade vegetal. Grandes herbivoros e patogenos de plantas podem ter efeitos sinergicos na regulacao da diversidade de comunidades vegetais em alguns dos mais diversos ecossistemas do planeta.

AB  - The hypothesis that certain woody species may be prone to local extirpation under chronic elephant utilisation was examined for Colophospermum mopane open woodland, for an area within the foraging range of elephants from permanent water. Elephant density increased from nearly absent in the 1970s to >3 elephants km(-2,) with 0.62 adult bulls km(-2), by 2022. Study components of vegetation impact included a long-term elephant exclosure, a fence-line contrast with an adjacent communal area, comparison with an adjacent wildlife reserve carrying a fifth of the elephant density and the use of historical studies of the vegetation. A history of elephant utilisation resulted in woodland becoming hedged through pollarding of tree stems by elephants. Impacted woodland was characterised by a slightly lower tree density, reduced average height of trees, altered shrub composition and lower species richness. The dominant C. mopane and sub-dominant species had persisted. However, about 14 species were potentially trending towards local extirpation on account of very high levels of adult mortality, but had persisted because of a low level of seedling recruitment. Fleshy fruits were a shared attribute among most extirpation-trending species, which, together with a reduction in woody species richness that affects browsers, has ramifications for trophic flows.

AB  - Garry oak (Quercus garryana) and associated ecosystems (GOAE) are culturally and ecologically significant landscapes home to over 100 Species at Risk. With less than 5% of their original extent remaining in Canada, GOAE require urgent attention to guide management of remnant habitats and protect them from ongoing cumulative threats. The loss of top predators has played a large role in a trophic cascade where hyperabundant black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus colum-bianus) are reshaping plant and animal communities, even within protected areas. The impacts of deer browsing on plant communities is well-documented; however, the impact on pollinators that are essential for the restoration and conservation of GOAEs is still unknown. We tested the hy-pothesis that deer browsing has an indirect impact on bumblebee populations through their direct negative impact on floral communities. We surveyed deer density, floral communities, and bumblebee abundances across ten islands with differing levels of deer presence in the Salish Sea. We found that deer had a negative effect on the abundance of flowering plants, with an even greater effect on native species that bumblebees rely on for foraging. Deer presence had an in-direct negative impact on female bumblebee abundances through the depletion of floral re-sources. Deer also had a negative impact on male bumblebee abundances, potentially caused by lowered colony success over the season on islands with less floral resources. These findings highlight the importance of immediate deer management to prevent the loss of native pollinators and further, potentially irreversible, ecological degradation of GOAEs.

AB  - Extensive cattle ranging is an important economic activity in mountains, with diverse effects on native mammal communities. The effects of cattle Bos taurus can be negative, positive or neutral, mostly depending on the stocking rate. We examined the effect of cattle on the diversity and abundance of native mammalian species in the Austral Yungas region of Argentina, considering environmental variables, land protection status, and human influence. Using 12,512 trap-nights from 167 camera-trap stations over 11 years (2009-2019), we calculated a relative abundance index using camera events and used generalized linear models to estimate the effect of cattle on small mammals, large herbivores, species of conservation concern and felids. Cattle had different effects on each group of native mammals. We observed a lower abundance of large native herbivores and the absence of small mammals in areas with high cattle abundance. The tapir Tapirus terrestris, jaguar Panthera onca and white-lipped peccary Tayassu pecari are rare in the Yungas and therefore potentially vulnerable to extinction there. Conservation of small felids and low cattle abundance could be compatible, but felids are threatened by other anthropogenic influences. Native mammalian diversity and richness were related to land protection status. The entire ecoregion is potentially suitable for cattle, suggesting the potential for further threats, and that cattle should be excluded from strictly protected areas. To ensure extensive cattle ranging is compatible with wildlife conservation in areas where exclusion is not possible, we recommend improved management of cattle and moderate stocking rates.

AB  - Increases or decreases in grazing cause significant disturbances in natural and managed forests. Indeed, grazing impacts can be on par with habitat destruction, exotic species invasion and fire. Grazing can produce changes in the diversity of native and exotic species as well as in functional plant groups at community and ecosystem levels. Unfortunately, overgrazing is a common occurrence in many plant communities, increasing erosion risks, land degradation and plant invasion. We analyze and quantify the effects of grazing by goats as well as cattle and horses on forest structure and spatial distribution of a dominant tree species (Pinus cembroides) in Coahuila, Mexico, an area affected by overgrazing and with problems of desertification. We also assess the influence of other forest variables that may be affected by cattle grazing, such as infestation by Tillandsia recurvata (an atmospheric epiphytic bromeliad) on P. cembroides. The study site is a protected area of 45,000 ha in the Sierra of Zapaliname (Coahuila, Mexico). In this area, grazing is considered a traditional and essential activity as the local economy depends on it. Eight plots (900 m(2)) 100 m apart were set up over a control site that had been grazed by cattle and equines for at least the last 100 years, while another eight plots (also 100 m apart) were established in an area that had excluded grazing for 25 years. Tree species composition and forest structure were analyzed in the plots, as well as other relevant variables, like T. recurvata infestation. The number of tree species (DBH>2.5 cm) differed significantly in control (6) vs. exclusion areas (11), with higher values in the latter. In addition, infestation of T. recurvata was found to be significatively higher in plots where grazing occurred. Spatial analysis of the tree distribution did not reveal any specific patterns related to either grazed or exclusion areas, and neither were there significant differences in species composition. For saplings (>50 cm high and <2.5 cm DBH), five species were present in exclusion plots, while there were only three in control ones. Regarding seedlings (<50 cm high), three species were present in both exclusion and control plots. Our findings suggest that grazing may have modified species richness and made the tree population more vulnerable to parasitic plants, as shown by the higher infestation levels. Also, tree regeneration has been negatively affected, reducing the number of species. We suggest a reduction in grazing pressure and more restrictive grazing management for the forest site as a way of maintaining landscape use, cultural values, and biodiversity.

AB  - The effects of grazing and browsing by terrestrial vertebrates are poorly understood for southern hemisphere saltmarshes, many of which are recovering from stock grazing. We investigated whether the native late-successional shrub, Tecticornia arbuscula, regenerating several years after the cessation of stock grazing, was grazed by wild herbivorous mammals to the degree of impeding recovery. We measured T. arbuscula growth parameters in exclosures and adjacent controls for two years and used camera trapping of animals across four consecutive austral seasons to indicate grazing pressure. Height growth was more affected by exclosure from grazing than lateral change. Notably, grazing did not prevent the recovery of the shrubs from stock grazing at either site, suggesting that the growth rate of T. arbuscula relative to total grazing pressure is at sustainable levels and these shrubs are in a trajectory of recovery, with the smaller plants growing the fastest. Also, we found little difference between our two sites in grazing impact, despite one site having twice the number of animals, largely native macropods, as the other site, which was dominated by introduced lagomorphs (rabbits and hares). These findings further the knowledge of native and non-native terrestrial vertebrates in austral saltmarsh ecology and conservation.

AB  - Island avifauna suffer high rates of extinction and decline. North Island in the Houtman Abrolhos Archipelago, Western Australia, supports one of three populations of the Abrolhos Painted Button-quail (Turnix varius scintillans), a subspecies determined to be the 5th most likely taxon to become extinct in Australia. T. v. scintillans were last recorded on North Island in 2006. Vegetation declines on North Island due to introduced tammar wallabies (Notamacropus eugenii derbianus) and predation by introduced house mice (Mus musculus) are implicated as major threats. Between 2018 and 2021, 12,820 camera trap-nights on North Island failed to detect any signs of T. v. scintillans, suggesting local extinction. We deployed rodent chew cards at each camera site and analysed rainfall and vegetation cover data to identify potential causes of decline. Vegetation cover change was related to tammar wallaby density and was highly correlated with rainfall (r(2) = 0.75). At the time of the last button-quail sighting in 2006, tammar wallaby numbers were at their peak, and annual rainfall was near its lowest level. Introduced tammar wallabies and house mice in tandem with reduced rainfall have likely resulted in degradation of habitat critical for T. v. scintillans, which is now confined to just two islands. Preventing further introductions of mice, rats and feral cats is a high priority for limiting further declines of this subspecies.

AB  - Carrion can have disproportionally large effects on ecological processes and community dynamics. During decomposition, the influx of growth-limiting nutrients can create small-scale disturbances with high soil cover known as 'cadaver decomposition islands' (CDIs). Such disturbances can allow for altered plant species composition, increased biomass production or provide microsites for regeneration. Carcasses also provide a resource for omnivorous scavengers, which have the potential to direct endozoochorous seed dispersal towards developing CDIs. In this study, we investigated functional links between the scavenger community, carcass-induced disturbances in vegetation and the seedling establishment of berry-producing ericaceous species. We experimentally placed out 30 vertebrate carcasses of various species in a boreal forest ecosystem, each paired with a control and a mechanically disturbed plot to track vertebrate animal activity (i.e. dispersal vectors), vegetation changes (i.e. recruitment windows) and seedling establishment. We hypothesized that carcass size and season of experimental deposition would affect (H1) scavenger community composition and (H2) formation of CDIs, and that (H3) seedling establishment of ericaceous species is more abundant at CDIs compared with control or disturbed plots without carcass deposition. We found that carcass presence effectively created a spatiotemporal hotspot of animal activity and that 94% of observations of vertebrates at carcasses were of species with the potential for ericaceous seed dispersal. Larger carcasses (e.g. moose, reindeer) attracted similar and abundant vertebrate communities, whereas observations at small carcasses (e.g. red fox) resembled those at control plots (H1). Only larger carcasses led to CDI formation (i.e. potential recruitment microsites), while plots with small carcasses resembled control plots (H2). Surprisingly, the season of carcass deposition did not influence vertebrate composition at carcass plots or CDI formation (H1-2). Seedlings were significantly more abundant in CDIs compared with mechanical disturbance and control plots (H3). Overall, CDIs contained about 4 and 19 times more seedlings compared with disturbed and controls, respectively. Our study demonstrates how individual carcasses in a boreal forest landscape can facilitate sexual reproduction in ericaceous keystone species. We suggest that this pathway also occurs in other ecosystems and that it may contribute to the genetic diversity of plant populations.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Prey depletion poses a threat to large carnivores worldwide. The Javan leopard ( Panthera pardus melas ), the last remaining apex predator on the Indonesian island of Java, is facing numerous threats from human activities including poaching, habitat loss and prey depletion. Despite the fact that the Javan leopard is an adaptable and opportunistic predator capable of surviving in various environments, our understanding of its prey and predator -prey interactions is still limited, which is crucial for their conservation. Using camera trap data collected from four national parks (i.e., Ujung Kulon, Gunung Gede Pangrango, Meru Betiri, Alas Purwo) that represent four distinct terrestrial ecoregions across the island of Java, we investigated the species richness, relative abundance, and spatial -temporal overlap in activity patterns between the Javan leopard and other animals that coexist in the same location. Our analysis of 7461 independent photos, covering 12,983 camera trap days, revealed that areas with the presence of Javan leopards exhibited higher species richness and abundance compared to those without the presence of Javan leopards. In addition, we found that the activities of banteng ( Bos javanicus ), barking deer ( Muntiacus muntjak ), Javan deer ( Rusa timorensis ), Javan mousedeer ( Tragulus javanicus ), wild boar ( Sus scrofa ), junglefowl ( Gallus spp. ), spangled ebony langur ( Trachypithecus auratus ), Javan rhino ( Rhinoceros sondaicus ), long-tailed macaque ( Macaca fascicularis ) and dhole ( Cuon alpinus ) were highly overlapping with those of Javan leopards in space and time, suggesting that these species are potential candidate prey for Javan leopards. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive investigation of potential prey for the Javan leopard that utilizes camera traps from all four types of terrestrial ecoregions on Java Island. The findings of this study may serve as essential information for the conservation of this critically endangered species.

AB  - Temperate grassland ecosystems are one of the most threatened ecosystems worldwide, and their loss endangers the grassland songbirds that rely upon them. This guild of birds has shown long-term declines in North America. At the same time, American bison (Bison bison) are becoming more common through reintroductions, and they may make significant modifications to grassland songbird habitat. To support conservation for this guild, we sought to understand the importance of bison grazing and ecosystem productivity to the species richness, occupancy, and abundance of this avian community. We conducted dependent double-observer bird counts, measured bison grazing intensity with patty counts, and used remote-sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data to measure ecosystem productivity. Our work took place in the National Bison Range near Moiese, Montana and in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. We found that species richness was positively correlated with patty counts and had a weak negative correlation with NDVI. Occupancy probability for six of seven grassland songbird species was positively correlated with patty counts, and for six of seven species was negatively correlated with NDVI. Abundance of vesper sparrow (Pooecetes graminueus) and western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) were positively correlated with patty counts, although for western meadowlark, this trend became less positive with increasing patty counts. Our work suggests that managers may want to encourage a broad range of bison grazing intensities to ensure that vegetative conditions related to bison grazing are present for all species.

AB  - The hog deer Axis porcinus formerly occurred in south-west China but has not been recorded there since 1965. To investigate the current status of the species in China, we conducted interviews, and transect and camera-trap surveys during October 2018-June 2020 to search for signs of hog deer across its historical range in the country. We interviewed 50 local inhabitants and surveyed 14 line transects in four counties of Lincang City, Yunnan Province. The camera traps were deployed in Nangunhe Nature Reserve (39.4 km of transects, 82 camera stations, 15,120 camera days) and Daxueshan Nature Reserve (41.1 km of transects, 68 camera stations, 13,554 camera days). We found no hog deer tracks and no hog deer were trapped by cameras. The floodplain grasslands preferred by hog deer along Nanting River have been transformed into agriculture plantations and human settlements. Our findings suggest that hog deer may have been extirpated from China, most likely as a result of habitat loss and overhunting. The conservation priorities for this species in China are the establishment of a protected area in the Nanting River watershed, restoration of habitat and reintroduction of individuals from range countries.

AB  - Landscape-scale forest loss threats biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, but its effect on insect herbivory and pathogen infection on trees is not well understood. Little is known about how forest loss alters the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on foliar damages. Here, we assessed the relative importance of forest loss, microclimates, tree community attributes, leaf traits (e.g., specific leaf area, SLA), and arthropod abundance on insect and pathogen damage on laurel poplars in natural riparian forests in Xinjiang, China. We found that forest loss increased foliar insect herbivory directly through reduction of food availability and indirectly through reduction in tree diversity and host resistance (greater SLA). In comparison, forest loss only indirectly increased pathogen infection through lower tree diversity and associated higher SLA. Early season insect herbivory promoted later season pathogen infection. Microclimates were not associated with insect and pathogen damage, nor was arthropod abundance with insect herbivory. Our results suggest that forest loss reduced tree diversity which, in turn, changed host leaf traits and associational resistance and undermined bottom-up controls on insect herbivory and pathogen infection. Comparatively, top-down control of herbivory through predation was not significant. The positive relationship between tree diversity and host resistance (leaf traits, e.g., SLA) may be critical for maintaining forest health and ecosystem functioning in plantations and fragmented natural forests when insect pathogen damage at normal, non-outbreak conditions.

AB  - The Arabian leopard (Panthera pardus nimr) has experienced dramatic range and population contractions over the last century. Conservation efforts for this felid focused on captive breeding and identification of suitable conditions for reintroductions. With this study, we unravelled historical collaring and direct observations data to understand the spatial use of the last leopards recorded in the region of Israel and the West Bank (IWB). Through datasets of leopard occurrence, we characterised suitable habitats, assessed niche overlap with the Arabian leopard's main prey, the Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana), and evaluated their distributions with respect to currently protected habitats. We estimated home-ranges employing area-corrected density kernel methods and investigated suitable conditions through multiple scales habitat modelling. Average home ranges for the population were 73.24 +/- 47.91 km2 and 77.46 +/- 54.94 km2, depending on the time lag adopted. Ecological response to predictors highlighted reliance by both predator and prey on the same habitat characteristics, suggesting they occupied essentially identical niches. These characteristics were intermediately rugged topographic conditions and high indices of vegetation in scarcely populated desert environments, mostly encompassed within protected areas. The distribution of leopard and ibex overlapped substantially according to several metrics. Notably, more than half of potential habitat for both species is encompassed by protected areas and military zones. Given the coincidence in their ecological requirements, and highly congruent distributions, an important step towards future reintroduction of Arabian leopards will include gaining a better understanding of ibex populations, alongside attention to the practicality of enforcing habitat protection.

AB  - Cryptogams, often neglected in vegetation dynamics studies, compose a large part of biomass and contribute to the biodiversity of sandy grasslands. Since the work of Verseghy (1970s), their productivity has not been analyzed in Hungary. We studied the lichen and bryophyte dynamics (hereinafter called cryptogams) at two Eastern Hungarian dry sandy grassland sites. The sites of Corynephorus canescens and of Festuca vaginata dominance, respectively, belonging to the community Festuco vaginatae-Corynephoretum have been monitored. We aimed at (1) quantifying the diversity and biomass of the cryptogamic communities; (2) exploring the cryptogamic response to management changes; and (3) studying the effect of experimental management (fencing) on the cryptogamic assemblages. The sites have been compared in 2013 and 2018, respectively. Forty microplots per site per management have been analyzed in both years. Samples of lichens and bryophytes were hand-sorted, dried and then measured. Fencing has led to increased biomass of cryptogams within a few years. Lichens in general benefited comparatively more from exclosure than bryophytes. The increase in lichen biomass (especially that of Cladonia rangiformis) is clearly due to the over 10-year absence of grazing. The only lichen favored by moderate grazing is the legally protected C. magyarica. Short spells of low-intensity grazing can promote the species richness of cryptogams in the community.

AB  - Musk deer ( Moschus spp.) are widely known for its musk and are globally endangered as a result of poaching, habitat loss, and fragmentation. To facilitate restoration of the alpine musk deer (M. M. chrysogaster) ) in existing areas, reliable estimates of population size and influencing factors are essential to assess effectiveness of conservation interventions, particularly for isolated musk deer populations in patches. In this paper, we used line transect and camera trap data collected from 2020 to 2022 in the Helan mountains to assess the population status and characterized the influencing factors of alpine musk deer. Our findings indicate that musk deer are patchily distributed in three areas of high elevation, with the population limited to less than 200 individuals, remaining below historic levels (compared to 1995). There was a significant positive correlation between the role of sympatric species on musk deer, with red fox ( Vulpes vulpes), ), badger ( Meles meles) ) and blue eared-pheasant ( Crossoptilon auritum) ) having a significant effect on the out-modeled pathway. Variable but insignificant effects of anthropogenic activities were observed across all species categories, which could be due to mutual adaptation over time. Our results imply that the recovery of sensitive population in island-like habitats remains challenging and may be exacerbated by limited environment and resources. Our study underscores the necessity of establishing ecological corridors to enhance habitat connectivity for alpine musk deer, undertaking conservation genetics research on isolated populations, controlling stray dogs to maintain interspecific balance, and implementing electronic fencing to mitigate human disturbance and resource competition. This study provides basic information for understanding the population status of alpine musk deer and offers insights for conservation efforts.

AB  - 1. Introduced large herbivores have partly filled ecological gaps formed in the late Pleistocene, when many of the Earth's megafauna were driven extinct However, extant predators are generally considered incapable of exerting top-down influences on introduced megafauna, leading to unusually strong disturbance and herbivory relative to native herbivores.
   2. We report on the first documented predation of juvenile feral donkeys Equus africanus asinus by cougars Puma concolor in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts of North America. We then investigated how cougar predation corresponds with differences in feral donkey behaviour and associated effects on desert wetlands.
   3. Focusing on a feral donkey population in the Death Valley National Park, we used camera traps and vegetation surveys to compare donkey activity patterns and impacts between wetlands with and without cougar predation.
   4. Donkeys were primarily diurnal at wetlands with cougar predation, thereby avoiding cougars. However, donkeys were active throughout the day and night at sites without predation. Donkeys were similar to 87% less active (measured as hours of activity a day) at wetlands with predation (p <0.0001). Sites with predation had reduced donkey disturbance and herbivory, including similar to 46% fewer access trails, 43% less trampled bare ground and 192% more canopy cover (PERMANOVA, R-2 = 0.22, p = 0.0003).
   5. Our study is the first to reveal a trophic cascade involving cougars, feral equids and vegetation. Cougar predation appears to rewire an ancient food web, with diverse implications for modern ecosystems. Our results suggest that protecting apex predators could have important implications for the ecological effects of introduced megafauna.

AB  - Fire modifies the composition and distribution of biodiversity, but the availability of broad elevational gradients for evaluating its effects is limited. Studies conducted along elevational gradients provide valuable insights into the impacts of large-scale disturbances. Due to their sensitivity to environmental changes and low palatability to invasive herbivores, bryophytes serve as effective bioindicators for analyzing disturbance levels in oceanic island ecosystems where herbivores have been introduced. Our research focused on examining how alpha and beta diversity and bryophyte species composition change along an elevational gradient from 200 to 2000 m a.s.l. in areas affected by fire 20 years ago compared to control areas that have been fire-free for at least 50 years. This study was carried out using different functional bryophyte groups in the pine forest of La Palma Island (Canary Islands), where this ecosystem is well represented. The findings revealed the sensitivity of the Canarian pine forest ecosystem to fire. Pine forest areas burnt 20 years ago were significantly poorer in bryophyte species than those in areas free from fire for at least 50 years. alpha-diversity is proposed as the most indicative parameter for analyzing the impacts of fire on the studied functional groups along the entire gradient analyses. However, beta-diversity is more dependent on environmental conditions, increasing in the wettest pine forests. The results suggest that the fire impacts vary depending on the specific functional group of bryophytes and the type of pine forest.

AB  - Eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) are an important game bird in the United States, particularly in the Southeast. The introduction of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) can negatively affect native wildlife, habitat quality, and ecosystem functions. To explore the potential effects that pig presence, through habitat degradation and interspecific competition, may have on wild turkeys, we evaluated changes in occupancy of co-occurring wild pigs and wild turkeys.We deployed camera-monitored bait stations on 3 wildlife management areas in Arkansas during January-April 2017-2019 and collected >680,000 images to determine turkey and wild pig occurrence. We evaluated presence/absence of turkeys and wild pigs in camera trap images using Timelapse2 image analyzer software (R) and then used program MARK to create 2-species occupancy models and determine the effect of wild pig presence and various landscape covariates on the occupancy and detectability of wild turkeys. The occupancy rate of wild pigs was 50.4% (95% CI = 46.9%-54.0%) and included positive relationships with the percent cover of deciduous forest and the number of wildlife openings within 500 m. The occupancy rate of turkeys increased from 45.5% (95% CI = 39.3%-51.6%) when wild pigs were not present to 59.4% (95% CI = 45.2%-73.5%, 95%) when wild pigs were present, indicating a tendency of the 2 species to select for similar environmental conditions (Species Interaction Factor = 1.13). Detectability of turkeys decreased when wild pigs occupied a site at any point during the season, regardless of whether or not the wild pigs were detected during the same trapping occasion. The decrease in detectability suggests a possible short-term displacement of turkeys by wild pigs. This displacement can have indirect effects through alteration of breeding behaviors and altered habitat use patterns, and these indirect effects represent an important topic for research moving forward.

AB  - Large structures are introduced into deep-water marine environments by several industrial activities, including hydrocarbon exploitation. Anthropogenic structures can alter ecosystem structure and functioning in many marine ecosystems but the responses on continental margins are poorly known. Here, we investigate the short-term response of benthic megafauna to the installation of a 56 km-long 30 cm diameter pipeline on the Angolan Margin (Block 31) from 700 to 1800 m water depth using remotely operated vehicle imagery. Clear depth-related patterns exist in the density, diversity and community structure of megafauna observed in 2013 prior to pipeline installation. These patterns are altered in a subsequent survey in 2014, three-months after pipeline installation. Significant increases in density, particularly in mid-slope regions are observed. Diversity is generally, but not consistently, enhanced, particularly in the shallower areas in 2014. Clear changes are noted in community structure between years. These changes are primarily caused by increases in the abundance of echinoderms, particularly the echinoid Phormosoma sp. indet. There was no evidence of colonisation of the pipeline in three months by visible fauna. The few large anemones observed attached to the pipe may be able to move as adults. The pipeline appeared to trap organic material and anthropogenic litter, and may enhance available food resources locally as well as providing hard substratum. These results indicate complex and ecosystem-dependent responses to structure installation and caution against simplistic approaches to environmental management.

AB  - There has been a long-standing interest in understanding how interactions between fire and herbivory influence woody vegetation dynamics in savanna ecosystems. However, controlled, replicated experiments examining how different fire regimes interact with different herbivore groups are rare. We tested the effects of single and repeated burns, crossed with six replicated herbivore treatments, on the mortality and growth of woody vegetation in the Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment plots located in a semi-arid savanna system in central Kenya. Burned plots experienced higher tree mortality overall, but differences between burns and non-burns were only significant in plots excluding all wild herbivores and in plots accessible to megaherbivores. Cattle ameliorated the negative effects of repeat burns on tree mortality, perhaps by suppressing fuel load accumulation. Across all herbivore treatments, trees experienced a significant reduction in height within the first two years after fire (top-kill), which was followed by a gradual recovery. Saplings and coppices subjected to repeated burns regrew faster than those that were burned once, except in the presence of megaherbivores. This study highlights strong context-dependent interactions between fire and different herbivore groups, and extends previous approaches to understanding fire-herbivory interactions, which have tended to lump the effects of different herbivore groups, or study them separately.

AB  - Lowland grassland fragments in southeast Australia are valued for both sheep grazing and conservation. Many fragments are now rarely burnt, despite being shaped by millennia of Aboriginal fire-use. Restoring fire could potentially reduce fuels, control exotic plant species, promote native species and renew Aboriginal cultural burning. However, this requires understanding of how fire and large herbivores, both native and exotic, are coupled and influence vegetation. We implemented a single round of low-intensity experimental burns in an area of remnant grassland and patchy eucalypt woodlands in Tasmania that is managed for conservation, albeit intermittently grazed by sheep, as well as by native and exotic wild herbivores. We compared herbivore activity between burnt and unburnt areas over 2 years using cameras and scat transects, and assessed how fire and herbivory influenced herbaceous biomass and the cover of broad vegetation classes with and without herbivore exclusion. Contrary to expectations, burnt areas did not disproportionately attract the main herbivores: domestic sheep, introduced deer and native wallabies. In the predominant grassy sward, grazing and fire both reduced herbaceous biomass but we found no support for our hypothesis that grazing reduces biomass more strongly after burning. This contrasts with isolated patches of Poa tussock grassland, where fire reduced biomass much more strongly than grazing, and grazing effects on biomass were more pronounced following burning. The cover of broad vegetation classes was little affected by burning, but excluding herbivores increased exotic grass cover in both burnt and unburnt plots. Practical implication. In degraded fragments of lowland native grassland, burning and grazing do not necessarily act as strongly synergistic disturbances. Grazing by sheep and wild herbivores can help to control exotic grasses and reduce herbaceous biomass, although burning is much more effective than grazing for reducing biomass of unpalatable Poa tussock grassland. Our results suggest that returning occasional low-intensity fires to our study system, and other degraded grassland-woodland fragments, can be compatible with livestock production and conservation goals, but this requires caution and adaptive management.
   Conserving and restoring southeast Australia's degraded remnant lowland grasslands is a priority, but many are used for sheep grazing and rarely burnt, despite being shaped by Indigenous fire-use. We returned fire to a degraded grassland fragment in the Tasmanian midlands that is used for sheep grazing, and assessed how this influenced; (i) sheep and wild herbivore activity; (ii) vegetation biomass and (iii) broad vegetation composition. The results suggest grazing is an important control on exotic grasses in degraded grassland fragments, and that restoring fire can be compatible with livestock production and conservation goals.image

AB  - Drylands, which cover more than 40% of the Earth's terrestrial surface, face rising agricultural demand and the influence of climate change. Understanding how livestock grazing pressure and local climate affect these environments is pivotal for informed land management. We studied big sagebrush plant communities in southwestern Wyoming over grazing gradients created by artificial livestock watering points. To explore the role of abiotic factors in shaping plant community response to grazing, we assessed the response of plant functional groups to grazing while accounting for soil texture variability across a precipitation gradient. Our models estimated that sagebrush cover responded positively to grazing intensity, with a 6% increase in cover with intensity when comparing the heaviest grazing treatment with the lowest grazing intensity. Perennial bunchgrass cover, the primary forage component, had a small negative response, a 3% decrease in cover from the lowest grazing intensity to the highest. Grazing intensity had no effect on bunchgrass density, perennial forbs, or rhizomatous grasses. Compared with abiotic factors, grazing intensity had a small effect on perennial bunchgrass and bare ground. We found that precipitation explained a 13% increase in perennial bunchgrass cover and a 34% decrease in bare ground cover compared with a 6% increase with increasing intensity across our grazing gradients. Sand content also had a larger effect on perennial bunchgrass cover and density than grazing. Increased sand content was associated with increased bunchgrass cover and density, supporting the inverse texture hypothesis. Our results show that while livestock grazing impacts sagebrush plant communities, its effect is small when compared with the effects of climate and soil. Our study contributes to a growing body of research emphasizing the need to contextualize plant community responses to grazing within specific climatic and edaphic conditions, which will promote effective land management in dryland ecosystems.

AB  - Vegetation on islands is particularly vulnerable to overgrazing by introduced herbivores as plants have evolved under lower herbivore pressure than on the mainland. We conducted a combination of field experiments and surveys to study the foraging behavior of feral goats and their impact on the composition, abundance and condition of keystone columnar cactus species. On the goat-browsed Caribbean island of Bonaire, 76.6 % of the adult cacti showed bark damage. The degree of bark damage on individual cacti was negatively correlated with the probability of bearing fruits and the number of fruits carried. Foraging experiments, in both field and enclosure settings, showed that goats preferentially consume the Subpilocereus repandus cacti. Experimental spine removal did not change goat foraging preference for this species. Overgrazing by feral goats reduced recruitment and increased mortality, shifting species relative abundance and population structure of columnar cacti species. S. repandus had a population structure characterized by a large proportion of adults, and low proportion of juveniles and resprouting individuals. We subsequently show that cactus communities have largely recovered from such impacts on the nearby island of Klein Bonaire where goats have been controlled for about half a century. Our findings reveal how overgrazing by feral goats shapes the community structure of columnar cactus species and imply that goat eradication is an essential step for the recovery and conservation of the original columnar cacti communities of Caribbean dry seasonal forests.

AB  - Physical trampling is a ubiquitous activity of walking vertebrates, but is poorly understood as a mechanism impacting biogeochemical cycling in soil. Lack of detailed knowledge of soil abiotic-biotic interactions underlying trampling effects, and the primary sources of heterogeneity in these effects, limit our ability to predict ecosystem-level consequences of ongoing population changes in large animals. We conducted a summer field study of moose trampling effects on soil properties and nitrogen cycling using natural moose trails in boreal forest and heath barren ecosystems on the island of Newfoundland, Canada. We tested the extent to which trampling effects on soil abiotic properties, microbes, and nitrogen cycling depend on local trampling severity, and/or ecosystem type. Using structural equation models, we further tested whether trampling effects on soil nitrogen mineralization occurred via indirect interaction chains mediated by soil abiotic and microbial properties. Finally, we tested whether trampling modifies plot-scale controls on net nitrogen mineralization. Trampling effects on the soil environment, substrate, and microbial properties depended on ecosystem type, but rarely on trampling severity. Trampling effects were of consistently greater magnitude in heath than in forest. Further, trampling effects on organic matter content, pH, moisture, microbial abundance, and microbial community composition were qualitatively different between forest and heath ecosystems. Trampling severity increased the magnitude of some trampling effects in heath, but did not impact the direction of the effects and did not significantly impact any trampling effects in forest. Trampling indirect effects on soil microbes were ecosystem-dependent but did not alter net N mineralization rates. In forest, trampling did not shift N mineralization rates via any indirect interaction chains, but modified relationships between N mineralization and other soil physical and microbial properties. In heath, multiple opposing interaction chains resulted in no net shift in N mineralization rates, and most relationships between diverse soil properties and N mineralization were not modified by trampling. Overall, our results disentangle complex abiotic-biotic interactions underlying megafauna effects on ecosystem functioning. These insights pave the way for better integration of animal consumptive and non-consumptive mechanisms into biogeochemical models, as well as prediction of trampling effects over landscapes.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Proliferations of zoantharians along tropical and subtropical regions are increasingly common and usually associated with anthropogenic impacts and ecosystem degradation. In the Canary Islands, we studied how the dominance in the substrate of Palythoa caribaeorum and Zoanthus pulchellus affected fish communities. For that purpose, we recorded the composition and biodiversity of fish assemblages associated to both zoantharian and macroalgae dominated habitats. In general terms, we found significant reductions of total fish abundance and richness at P. caribaeorum dominated habitats compared with macroalgae stands. However, in terms of trophic structure, there were significant changes within both zoantharian habitats depending on their coverages of the substrate. Herbivores and small invertebrate feeders, which are more adapted to forage in the macroalgae canopy, were less abundant in zoantharian habitats. This study demonstrates that the increasing dominance of zoantharians throughout the archipelago restructure the ecosystems and impact the native fish communities, that may offer a positive feedback for invasive tropical species to thrive.

AB  - Historically, oaks dominated the canopies of large regions of eastern North American forests, but at many sites current recruitment is insufficient to sustain oak dominance. Intense browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and light limitation due to expansion by fire-intolerant tree species may cause poor oak recruitment. In a xeric woodland in Kansas USA, we used a deer exclusion experiment in natural canopy gaps to quantify effects of browsing and light availability on post oak (Quercus stellata) sapling performance, meaning growth and survival. Two weeks after beginning the experiment, a prescribed fire occurred that, due to natural burn heterogeneity, affected 29 of 31 experimental canopy gaps and top-killed 78.6% of experimental saplings. This allowed us to examine post-fire recovery in a sub-set of saplings. Our hypotheses were 1) ambient deer browsing intensity reduces post oak sapling performance, 2) sapling performance increases with gap size and light availability, 3) deer browsing effects on sapling performance vary with light availability, and 4) re-growth rate of saplings that were top-killed by fire is affected by light, deer browsing and the interaction of light and browsing. After five years, deer exclusion increased sapling growth in height and aboveground biomass. Sapling height growth was positively correlated with light. Deer effects on sapling performance generally were consistent across light environments. However, there was a weak pattern toward more negative effects of browsing in high light than in low light environments for saplings that re-sprouted post-fire. Protection from deer shortened the time required for saplings to re-attain their pre-fire height from five to three years. We conclude that deer browsing reduces post oak recruitment in canopy gaps in these xeric woodlands. Further, under current browsing intensity, fire return intervals less than five years will strongly limit oak recruitment.

AB  - In the Sierra de Guadarrama National Park (central Spain), the population of Iberian wild goat, also known as Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) has grown strongly since its reintroduction three decades ago. The plant community is now under heavy browsing pressure due to this high population. A study of the presence of moss on rocks was used herein as the basis for the design of an indicator, named impact on mosses (im), to describe the environmental pressure exerted by the Iberian wild goat in terms of moss removal. Granite and gneiss zones at medium altitudes with continental Mediterranean climate are the most suitable areas for successful application of the indicator. The hypotheses to test are: (1) the indicator will discriminate between areas with different wild goat pressure levels, (2) wild goat pressure will explain a high proportion of moss loss variance, and (3) the im indicator will be useful to establish a mathematical model between wild goat pressure and moss loss. The proposed indicator was analyzed using both statistical and data science techniques. The results support the mentioned hypotheses. Specifically, statistically significant differences were found regarding the impact on mosses between areas with different levels of Iberian wild goat pressure. Thus, a high proportion of the variance was associated with wild goat pressure (80% for high-pressure areas, 56% for low-pressure areas). A modified parabolic function was fit to express the relationship between Iberian wild goat pressure and impact on mosses. In conclusion, the im indicator was shown to be a useful tool to assess pressure due to Iberian wild goat. Therefore, im can help assess and manage Iberian wild goat populations and determine their sustainable levels.

AB  - Habitat selection is a critical aspect of a species' ecology, requiring complex decision-making that is both hierarchical and scale-dependent, since factors that influence selection may be nested or unequal across scales. Elk (Cervus canadensis) ranged widely across diverse ecoregions in North America prior to European settlement and subsequent eastern extirpation. Most habitat selection studies have occurred within their contemporary western range, even after eastern reintroductions began. As habitat selection can vary by geographic location, available cover, season, and diel period, it is important to understand how a non-migratory, reintroduced population in northern Wisconsin, USA, is limited by the lack of variation in topography, elevation, and vegetation. We tested scale-dependent habitat selection on 79 adult elk from 2017 to 2020 using resource selection functions across temporal (i.e., seasonal) and spatial scales (i.e., landscape and home range). We found that selection varied both spatially and temporally, and elk selected areas with the greatest potential to influence fitness at larger scales, meaning elk selected areas closer to escape cover and further from "risky" features (e.g., annual wolf territory centers, county roads, and highways). We found stronger avoidance of annual wolf territory centers during spring, suggesting elk were selecting safer habitats during calving season. Elk selected habitats with less canopy cover across both spatial scales and all seasons, suggesting that elk selected areas with better access to forage as early seral stage stands have greater forage biomass than closed-canopy forests and direct solar radiation to provide warmth in the cooler seasons. This study provides insight into the complexity of hierarchical decision-making, such as how risky habitat features and land cover type influence habitat selection differently across seasons and spatial scales, influencing the decision-making of elk. Scale-dependent behavior is crucial to understand within specific geographic regions, as these decisions scale up to influence population dynamics.

AB  - Alien species are species that are introduced into an area where they are not naturally present. Some of them may exert negative ecological impacts, thus being defined as invasive. The aoudad or Barbary sheep Ammotragus lervia is a north-African ungulate commercialised and introduced for game hunting to Europe, South Africa, and America. As a generalist herbivore, the aoudad has a high capacity to adapt to new habitat conditions, possibly representing a threat to local biodiversity. We studied the aoudad population present in the Beigua Natural Regional Park in Liguria, northwestern Italy. By using historical data and camera trapping data, we reconstructed the colonization process and current distribution, estimated minimum abundance, assessed population trends over the years, and investigated habitat selection and activity rhythms. Aoudads most likely escaped from a game reserve in Ponzone Municipality, Piedmont, and settled in the park at least since 2009. The minimum number alive doubled in 10 years, from 9 to 23, and the population shows an increasing trend. Aoudads showed a preference for steep, rocky and woody areas in the southern and warmer part of the Beigua massif, especially at intermediate elevations. Some observations have recently occurred in the northern part of the Park, potentially due to geographical expansion. Aoudads show mostly diurnal activity, unlike native ungulates such as roe deer Capreolus capreolus and wild boar Sus scrofa which were most active at dawn, dusk and during the night, possibly reflecting anti-predator behaviour towards wolf Canis lupus. Our results are in line with other studies, though births occurred across a wider period of time compared with native populations. As the potential ecological impacts of this alien species in the study area have never been investigated, it will be important to monitor the population and evaluate its ecological effects to provide the most appropriate management solutions.

AB  - Theory suggests that eutrophication impacts plant community biodiversity by constraining niche differences and increasing competitive inequalities among species, leading to the exclusion of weaker competitors. However, explicit tests of nutrient effects on the strength and direction of inter- and intraspecific plant-plant interactions that dictate coexistence are lacking, especially in complex field settings where multiple processes can simultaneously affect plant growth and reproduction. We conducted a field experiment in southeastern Vancouver Island, Canada, using four annual grassland plant species to test how species interactions responded to eutrophication and the covariation of herbivore pressure and neighbour species light- and moisture-use. We found that focal species reproduction was limited by nutrient availability and herbivory, such that the nature of species interactions was context-dependent. Competitive interactions failed to predict species persistence under these conditions. Instead, facilitation was critical-phytometers grown without neighbours consistently failed to produce seed under herbivore pressure meaning that fecundity significantly increased with neighbour density. Synthesis. Our work demonstrates the importance of species interactions in plant community responses to eutrophication but emphasizes that 'indirect' drivers of plant performance may influence or overwhelm nutrient effects on plant-plant competition. The widespread occurrence of mortality overcome primarily by facilitation highlights the importance of positive density dependence. Overall, our results suggest that knowledge of resource niche overlap may be insufficient to explain plant community responses to eutrophication. This highlights the necessity of considering the broader environmental context when leveraging ecological theory to understand global change effects in empirical settings.
   Theory based on resource competition was insufficient to explain eutrophication-driven changes in grassland plant-plant interactions as multiple processes, especially herbivory, overwhelmed nutrient effects and increased the importance of facilitation.image

AB  - Construction of artificial wave shelters is a promising measure to stimulate submerged vegetation in large wind exposed lakes. Here we tested whether the construction of shelter results in the colonization of submerged vegetation and whether grazing by waterbirds hampers vegetation development under those sheltered conditions. We studied the effect of breakwaters that were constructed between 1992 and 1996 in the large (695 km(2)), wind exposed and turbid Lake Markermeer, The Netherlands. We used monitoring data to evaluate the development of submerged vegetation and its relation with the abundance of herbivorous birds and conducted a field grazer exclosure experiment to determine the effect of grazers on the newly established vegetation. We found that in the sheltered area, a dense charophyte dominated vegetation developed over 16 years, while submerged vegetation remained very sparse outside the breakwaters. The area also attracted many herbivorous birds, especially molting Mute swans during summer. After the breakwaters had been completed, 10 years passed before the development of the charophyte vegetation started. This delay was probably not caused by bird grazing, but more likely due to unfavorable light conditions in the first decade. The exclosure experiment confirmed that while grazing reduced macrophyte biomass by 50% and plant height by 45%, it did not affect vegetation cover, which remained high (90-95%) throughout summer. The water depth in most of the study area exceeded the depth range at which Mute swans prefer to forage and this probably prevented overgrazing. We conclude that building artificial wave shelters is an effective measure to stimulate submerged vegetation in large wind exposed lakes.

AB  - Whether species extinctions have accelerated during the Anthropocene and the extent to which certain species are more susceptible to extinction due to their ecological preferences and intrinsic biological traits are among the most pressing questions in conservation biology. Assessing extinction rates is, however, challenging, as best exemplified by the phenomenon of 'dark extinctions': the loss of species that disappear before they are even formally described. These issues are particularly problematic in oceanic islands, where species exhibit high rates of endemism and unique biological traits but are also among the most vulnerable to extinction. Here, we document plant species extinctions since Linnaeus' Species Plantarum in Macaronesia, a biogeographic region comprised of five hyperdiverse oceanic archipelagos, and identify the key drivers behind these extinctions. We compiled 168 records covering 126 taxa, identifying 13 global and 155 local extinction events. Significantly higher extinction rates were observed compared to the expected global background rate. We uncovered differentiated extinction patterns along altitudinal gradients, highlighting a recent coastal hotspot linked to socioeconomic changes in Macaronesian archipelagos from the 1960s onwards. Key factors influencing extinction patterns include island age, elevation, introduced herbivorous mammals, and human population size. Trait-based analyses across the floras of the Azores and Canary Islands revealed that endemicity, pollination by vertebrates, nitrogen-fixing capacity, woodiness, and zoochory consistently tended to increase extinction risk. Our findings emphasize the critical role of geography and biological traits, alongside anthropogenic impacts, in shaping extinction dynamics on oceanic islands. Enhancing our knowledge of life-history traits within island floras is crucial for accurately predicting and mitigating future extinction risks, underscoring the urgent need for comprehensive biodiversity assessments in island ecosystems.

AB  - In seagrass systems, there is a realization that biotic interactions affecting sediment stability might be as important as abiotic stressors in shaping the growth and distribution patterns of seagrass vegetation. However, few studies have looked at the interaction between seagrass and large (mega) bioturbating species, although through sediment reworking activity they may have the capacity to cause large scale impact on seagrass establishment. We assessed the effect of bioturbation by mobile megabioturbators (species lager than 5 cm) on subtidal seagrass (Cymodocea nodosa) using a manipulative field experiment where access by megabioturbators was restricted for 4 months during the growth season. There was a negative effect of megabioturbators on both the biomass and density of young seagrass ramets extending outwards from a mature seagrass meadow, but megabioturbators did not have a notable effect on seagrass growth in the meadows. Interestingly, the exclusion of megabioturbators in all tested habitats significantly modified the infaunal community composition, indicating the presence of complexity in biotic interactions and the possibility of indirect effects caused by the megabioturbators. Overall, megabioturbators have direct and indirect impact in seagrass habitats, playing a significant role in seagrass distribution patterns.

AB  - Re-establishment of ecosystem engineers via introduction of replacement species is increasingly being proposed to facilitate ecosystem restoration of island ecosystems around the world, yet attendant challenges and risks remain largely unknown. We evaluate the first phase (2015-2020) of a program to restore a population of giant tortoises, ecosystem engineers of terrestrial ecosystems of the Galapagos Islands, to Santa Fe Island during which a total of 551 juvenile and 31 subadult tortoises of the non-native Espanola Island species (Chelonoidis hoodensis) were translocated. After 5 years, most (85%) of tortoises released remain alive, exhibiting robust vital rates comparable to those of conspecifics in their native range, having colonized 10% of the island via gradual dispersal from the point-of-release. Populations of an arboreal cactus (Opuntia echios)-a keystone species for many organisms on the island and intended beneficiary of tortoise restoration-and pallid land iguanas (Conolophus pallidus)-an endemic, herbivorous reptile considered potentially at risk from the introduction of tortoises, both increased coincident with the arrival of tortoises. Herbivore exclosure experiments revealed that the island's plant community manifested a response to the arrival of tortoises; however, significant engineering of the island's vegetation will require many decades. These results highlight the first stage of what appears to be a successful conservation intervention that can serve as a "proof of concept" for introduction of ecological replacements to other islands in Galapagos, and potentially for other island ecosystems around the world.

AB  - In temperate Europe, oak-dominated forests are widespread, supporting high biodiversity and providing important ecosystem services. Insufficient natural regeneration has, however, been a concern for over a century. The objective of this study was to gain insights into differences in regeneration success using artificial and natural regeneration techniques for reforestation of oak (Quercus robur L.) stands. We monitored seedlings following planting, direct seeding and natural regeneration over five years in a randomized block experiment in southern Sweden with fenced and non-fenced plots. Fencing had a strong positive effect on height growth, especially for planted seedlings that were taller than the other seedlings and more frequently browsed in non-fenced plots. In contrast, there was little effect of fencing on survival, establishment rate and recruitment rate of seedlings. Due to aboveground damage on seedlings from voles, protection of acorns did not improve establishment rate following direct seeding. Under current circumstances at the site with a sparse shelterwood of old oaks, we conclude that natural regeneration was the most cost-efficient regeneration method. It resulted in the most seedlings at the lowest cost. However, regeneration success was heavily influenced by interference from herbaceous vegetation. With a small additional investment in vegetation control, the results might have been improved for planting and direct seeding.

AB  - Tropical forests are notable for their high species diversity, even on small spatial scales, and right-skewed species and size abundance distributions. The role of individual species as drivers of the spatial organization of diversity in these forests has been explained by several hypotheses and processes, for example, stochastic dilution, negative density dependence, or gap dynamics. These processes leave a signature in spatial distribution of small trees, particularly in the vicinity of large trees, likely having stronger effects on their neighbors. We are exploring species diversity patterns within the framework of various diversity-generating hypotheses using individual species-area relationships. We used the data from three tropical forest plots (Wanang-Papua New Guinea, Barro Colorado Island-Panama, and Sinharaja-Sri Lanka) and included also the saplings (DBH >= 1 cm). Resulting cross-size patterns of species richness and evenness reflect the dynamics of saplings affected by the distribution of large trees. When all individuals with DBH >= 1 cm are included, similar to 50% of all tree species from the 25- or 50-ha plot can be found within 35 m radius of an individual tree. For all trees, 72%-78% of species were identified as species richness accumulators, having more species present in their surroundings than expected by null models. This pattern was driven by small trees as the analysis of DBH >10 cm trees showed much lower proportion of accumulators, 14%-65% of species identified as richness repellers and had low richness of surrounding small trees. Only 11%-26% of species had lower species evenness than was expected by null models. High proportions of species richness accumulators were probably due to gap dynamics and support Janzen-Connell hypothesis driven by competition or top-down control by pathogens and herbivores. Observed species diversity patterns show the importance of including small tree size classes in analyses of the spatial organization of diversity.

AB  - North American tallgrass prairie evolved with regular fire set by Indigenous people and grazing from large herbivores, including the plains bison (Bison bison). In contrast to uniform effects of prescribed fire, bison graze selectively, creating increased heterogeneity on the landscape. We examined plant community responses to reintroduced bison grazing in high-diversity native and restored tallgrass prairie in Illinois, USA. We evaluated plant community diversity and structure in paired grazed and ungrazed (fenced) plots. After 5 y of grazing at a relatively low target stocking rate of 1 animal unit per 5.2 ha (13 acres), there were no differences in plant community diversity, composition, nonnative:native species ratio, or visual obstruction readings between grazed and ungrazed plots. An interaction exists (or was found) between plant community type and grazing in which grazed savanna plots had greater grass relative abundance compared to ungrazed plots. Ongoing monitoring will evaluate long-term trends.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) are one of the most important factors driving extinction rates worldwide. Among the IAS, the impacts of introduced mammals on native biodiversity are most severe, with the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) being the most problematic. Globally, European rabbits have been introduced to five continents and more than 800 islands or island groups where they are a threat to biodiversity and human livelihoods. The impacts of European rabbits on biodiversity and human livelihoods have been extensively studied across the globe. However, some regions of the world, such as the offshore islands along Africa's southern coast, have been sparsely studied. In this study, we monitored change in grazing capacity on a South African offshore island, Robben Island, following an attempt to eradicate European rabbits between 2008 and 2009. Grazing capacity on the island increased following rabbit control, driven by the recovery of palatable plant species in response to release from herbivory. There was no change in grazing capacity at sites under Eucalyptus plantations because of the inhibitory effects of the alien trees on understory vegetation dynamics. We believe that grazing capacity changes on Robben Island are indicative of potential vegetation changes on other southern African offshore islands.

AB  - Livestock grazing abandonment entails important shifts on the overall ecosystem function, but the effects of this land -use change on specific bacterial taxa remain poorly understood in mountain grasslands. Moreover, we currently lack knowledge about the feedbacks between changes in ecosystem functions affected by livestock abandonment in moun-tain grasslands and the soil bacterial communities. Here, we evaluated the behavior of bacterial communities' structure and composition at taxa level as a function of short (1-year) and long-term (15-years) grazing abandonment in a moun-tain grassland. We also linked the observed responses in the bacterial communities to changes in several ecosystem functions (i.e. primary production, plant species biodiversity, carbon stocks and soil fertility). The alpha diversity of the bacterial communities did not show a significant response as a consequence of grazing abandonment. However, we identified significant changes on the overall composition of soil bacterial communities between the long-term abandoned grassland areas and grazed or abandoned areas in the short term. We also evidenced a balance between the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) whose relative abundance is favored by livestock grazing (19.51 %) and those with higher relative abundances in long-term grazing exclusion areas (20.23 %) that could behave as indicators of grazing abandonment. Structural Equation Modeling analyses proved that several bacterial taxa asso-ciated with relevant ecosystem functions, such as Rhodospirillales order within Alphaproteobacteria phylum, featured significant changes in their relative abundance between grazing treatments. The direct and indirect effects of grazing exclusion on woody species encroachment and soil organic carbon were strongly linked to the changes in the abun-dance of bacterial taxa indicators. The assessment of the bacterial community response to livestock abandonment in mountain grasslands may thus provide early warning signs before subtle changes in ecosystem functions occur.

AB  - Islands of fertility associated with tree/shrub patches in arid grasslands create spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrients. Faunal activities under these trees/shrubs may contribute to diverse characteristics of these fertile patches of soil due to different faecal inputs. This study used the tree islands of fertility (TIFs) created by camelthorn (Vachellia erioloba) and shepherd trees (Boscia albitrunca) and these species that also host sociable weavers (Philetairus socius) nests (bird islands of fertility; BIFs) in the Kalahari Desert to investigate the diversity in islands of fertility. We hypothesized that grasslands, the TIFs, and the BIFs differ in both the concentrations and stoichiometries of soil nutrients due to the sources of nutrients and that this subsequently determines the growth and foliar nutrient concentrations and stoichiometries of plants that grow on these soils. We predicted that seedlings grown on soils from BIFs would have greater growth, higher biomass yield, and higher foliar nutrients than those grown on soils from TIFs and grasslands. We sampled and grew camelthorn seedlings in soils from BIFs, TIFs, and matrix grasslands. Despite the higher soil nutrients in TIFs than in grasslands, there were no significant differences in seedling growth. However, we observed significantly higher seedling growth in BIF soils compared to TIF soils. Seedlings grown in soils from BIFs and grasslands allocated more growth to shoots and roots, respectively, while those grown on TIF soils were intermediate. The foliar nutrient stoichiometries of seedlings grown in BIF soils were similar to the stoichiometric ratios in BIF soils and in sociable weaver faecal matter. This shows that the faecal input of the sociable weaver accounts for the growth differences in these islands of fertility. The ecological engineering activities of the sociable weaver address nutrient limitations for camelthorn seedling growth, which TIF soils could not address despite the high faecal input of mammals.

AB  - The success of ecosystem restoration depends on a multitude of factors related to both the properties of the ecosystem and resources available for the restoration. The ecological and management characteristics of the site, including the presence of invasive species or existing and continued management practices, may influence the success of restoration. Key to the ability to assess success of restoration is monitoring, which is increasingly being undertaken using remote sensing technology. In this chapter, we focus on invasive species management to restore intertidal wetland vegetation, and present a case study from North Queensland, Australia, where exclusion fences have been constructed to control feral pigs and restore intertidal vegetation. Physical vegetation sampling using quadrats and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery were used to determine vegetation change at five sites using image classification and ground truthing. Wetlands were fenced in an attempt to prevent feral pigs accessing the sites, but this was ultimately unsuccessful owing to existing management practices allowing cattle to graze in fenced wetlands, which presumably afforded feral pig access. Learnings here suggest that restoration initiatives cannot be implemented without first considering existing land management practices and how the two interact or compete with each other. While the use of UAV technology was useful for monitoring, restoration projects still need to be carefully designed with the ecological and management practices in mind in order to be successful.

AB  - We used a long-term herbivore removal experiment where paired exclosure-open treatments were established at the Mpala Research Centre, Laikipia, Kenya, in 1999 to examine changes in soil nitrogen (N) at nutrient-rich glades and adjacent nutrient-poor bushland sites after almost two decades of herbivore removal. Glades in this landscape are created by large inputs of dung and urine from previous long-term corralling of cattle in an otherwise nutrient-poor matrix of woodland (bushland). We predicted (1) a net gain of soil nutrients at bushland sites (that is, inputs of nutrients > losses) and (2) a net loss of soil nutrients at glade sites (that is, inputs of nutrients < losses) following herbivore exclusion. As expected, soil N increased (by 28% after 17 years) with herbivore removal, but remained largely unchanged in the presence of herbivores at low-nutrient bushland sites. However, contrary to our expectations, soil total N in nutrient-rich glades also increased (+ 18%) when herbivores were removed, but declined when grazed (- 11%). Although the underlying mechanisms are unclear, we suggest that increased N fixation by Acacia spp., combined with increased canopy cover and associated tree leaf litter, resulted in elevated soil N following browser removal in low-nutrient bushland sites, while grazer-induced increases in the rate of N transformations between organic and mineral forms resulted in a more "open" N cycle (as evidenced by higher N mineralization rates and foliar N), with increased potential for N loss in gaseous forms, in grazed nutrient-rich glade sites. Grazers and browsers thus appear to affect the N cycle and create and reinforce heterogeneity in unique ways.

AB  - Human-induced environmental change has caused widespread loss of species that support important functions for ecosystems and society. For example, vertebrate scavengers contribute to the functional health of ecosystems and provide services to agricultural landscapes by removing carcasses and associated pests. Widespread extirpation of native Australian mammals since the arrival of Europeans in Australia has removed many scavenging species from landscapes, while scavenging mammals such as European red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have been introduced. In much of Australia, squamate reptiles are the largest native terrestrial scavengers remaining, where large native mammals are extinct and conservation management is being undertaken to remove invasive mammals. The contribution of reptiles to scavenging functions is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the ecosystem functions provided by large reptiles as scavengers to better understand how populations can be managed to support ecosystem services. We investigated the ecosystem services provided by vertebrate scavengers in Australian coastal mallee ecosystems, focusing on the heath goanna (Varanus rosenbergi), the only extant native terrestrial scavenger in the region. We carried out exclosure experiments, isolating the scavenging activity of different taxonomic groups to quantify the contribution of different taxa to scavenging services, specifically the removal of rat carcasses, and its impact on the occurrence of agriculturally damaging blowflies. We compared areas with different native and invasive scavenger communities to investigate the impact of invasive species removal and native species abundance on scavenging services. Our results indicated that vertebrate scavenging significantly contributes to carcass removal and limitation of necrophagous fly breeding in carcasses and that levels of removal are higher in areas associated with high densities of heath goannas and low densities of invasive mammals. Therefore, augmentation of heath goanna populations represents a promising management strategy to restore and maximize scavenging ecosystem services.

AB  - Invasive omnivores may have profound impacts on ecological communities through diet selection, particularly when their functional roles differ from those in their native range. While the threat of feral pigs (Sus scrofa) to native plant communities in Hawai'i is well known, their trophic dynamics and the drivers of variation in their diet remain understudied. We investigated the feral pig trophic niche on Hawai'i Island using stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15) and Bayesian mixing models to identify drivers of variation in resource use. We also reconstructed intra-individual variability for six subsampled individuals to understand temporal variation in resource use and individual diet specialization. Our results revealed that feral pigs on Hawai'i Island exhibit a broad trophic niche characterized by diverse diets, with substantial overlap in resource use across districts and habitats. Differences in dietary composition in the transition from forest to open habitat were driven primarily by a decline in invertebrates and an increasing reliance on resources enriched in N-15, which may reflect a shift in protein sources with habitat. Pigs in forested areas exhibited a smaller trophic niche than those in open habitats, largely driven by differences in feeding strategies and resource availability. Diets for subsampled individuals varied little, suggesting feral pig resource-use strategies in Hawai'i tend to be relatively stable through time. Individual niche width was relatively narrow compared to that of feral pigs in Hawai'i at large, indicating the relatively wide feral pig dietary niche is characterized by substantial intraspecific diet specialization, likely as a result of strong intraspecific competition. Understanding the drivers of feral pig resource use offers key information for management strategies aimed at mitigating their ecological impacts in imperiled systems like Hawai'i.

AB  - Ungulates consume plants and seeds together with the insects that feed on them, which have consequences at the ecosystem level. We carried out an experiment to assess the effects of intraguild predation by livestock on the main acorn pest (Curculio spp. weevils) in Iberian oak Quercus spp. dehesas, a widespread traditional agroecosystem. Acorns are a key food source for free-range livestock (especially pigs), but, if properly managed, livestock could become a pest control agent. In three dehesa farms, we replicated eight experimental trios, each including one tree from which livestock was excluded, another from which all dropped acorns were removed manually (simulating intensified predation by livestock), and a control one in which livestock was allowed at standard densities. Removal of marked infested acorns by livestock, adult and larval weevil numbers, and acorn production/infestation rates were recorded at all trees. Livestock predated most weevil larvae within the prematurely dropped infested acorns before larvae had time to finish development. Hence, in those trees subjected to intensified predation, the local number of larvae decreased. Consequently, adult weevil abundance in the following year was lower than in trees within the exclosures of livestock. The consequence of the decrease in the number of adults was a reduction in the rates of acorn infestation in control oaks and intensified predation compared to those excluded from livestock (8% and 20%, respectively). C. elephas mobility is low, especially when trees are isolated, and acorn infestation is greatly dependent on the number of weevils emerging beneath the canopy of each oak. Therefore, a locally focused elimination of infested acorns may succeed in reducing the negative impacts of the pest. Synthesis and applications: We suggest intensifying livestock predation on prematurely dropped-infested acorns by allowing livestock foraging from October 1st onward. Pigs are usually released free range in early November, once weevil larvae have completed their development and escaped predation. The proposed management would increase the availability of healthy acorns, thus increasing the farm capacity and the economic profit by up to 20%, tens of millions of euros of additional profits when translated into the prices of the Iberian pork market.

AB  - Seabirds are important to island ecosystems because of their ecological functions; however, they are threatened by alien mammal invasions. Where alien mammals have been eradicated, seabird numbers, and ranges have often increased. Whether or not this constitutes recovery, however, is debatable because the post-eradication seabird fauna might be different from the pre-disturbance fauna that in most cases has not been recorded. Thus, identifying the pre-disturbance seabird fauna is essential to determine a conservation goal. With this as our aim, we examined and radiocarbon-dated avian bone remains found in a limestone cave on Minamijima, an islet on the Ogasawara Islands. The islet was invaded by goats Capra hircus and black rats Rattus rattus after 1830, and seabirds had declined. Since the 1970s, the alien mammals have been eradicated, and numbers of Wedge-tailed Shearwaters Puffinus pacificus, Bulwer's Petrels Bulweria bulwerii, and Brown Boobies Sula leucogaster have increased. However, the dominant species in the avian remains were Bonin Petrels Pterodroma hypoleuca, Bryan's Shearwaters Pu. bryani, and Bannerman's Shearwaters Pu. bannermani. The radiocarbon ages of the bones were approximately 6,000-600 years BP. Therefore, seabird fauna was largely changed by the invasion and eradication of alien mammals. Our results indicate that the post-eradication increase in seabirds is not a recovery, although the current inhabitants are native seabirds. The recent dominant species are likely to have thrived because they are cosmopolitan and competitive, and they prefer open habitats produced by goat grazing. We suggest that avian remains surveys should be exploited for ecosystem restoration.

AB  - The early stage of seedling establishment is critical to successful ecological restoration and reforestation, and it is partially influenced by herbivory. Aerial vertebrate predators, including birds and bats, can affect plant growth by controlling phytophagous insects. This study explored the effects of excluding birds and bats on the arthropod community during the initial stages of reforestation plots planted with Dipterocarpus alatus in deciduous dipterocarp forest using an exclusion experiment. We hypothesized that birds and bats negatively affect the density and biomass of large-sized arthropods (>= 1 cm), which are their potential prey, and that excluding these predators may affect seedling growth and leaf damage. The density and biomass of large arthropods significantly increased in the permanent exclosures compared to the control group. No significant difference between the nocturnal and diurnal exclosures was observed. Top-down effects on the biomass of large-sized phytophagous and predatory arthropods were pronounced during the dry season, coinciding with the presence of migratory insectivorous birds. Mesopredator release primarily driven by ants compensated for the absence of birds and bats, preventing immediate increases in herbivory or impacts on seedling growth. These findings highlight the importance of ecological redundancy among predator communities in maintaining herbivory control. Promoting diverse habitats that support both invertebrate and vertebrate predators may enhance the long-term resilience and effectiveness of pest control in ecological restoration efforts.

AB  - It is well understood, that grazing and browsing in the African savanna ecosystem modulates tree-grass ratios. However, many of the large mammals are under pressure due to land use and climate change. It is challenging to predict how their altered abundance or range shifts will interact with savanna structure. Herbivore exclusion experiments can help to better understand the impacts of herbivores of different sizes on vegetation structure and composition, including interactions with rainfall. Here, we combine field data of the Ungulate Herbivory Under Rainfall Uncertainty (UHURU) exclusion experiment and high spatial resolution satellite images of the Planet- Scope and Sentinel-2 series to investigate the impacts of herbivores on vegetation structure in a Kenyan savanna. Field data as well as NDVI values derived from Sentinel-2 and NDVI contrast values of PlanetScope show that presence of herbivores lowers vegetation cover and modify the woody vegetation structure depending on which herbivores are present. The vegetation grew tallest when mega-sized herbivores were absent but meso-sized and small herbivores were present, which resulted in high NDVI contrast values. The absence of herbivores resulted in fewer bare ground patches and increased green biomass, such as a higher mean canopy width, which led to higher NDVI values. Few studies have explored the potential of passive remote sensing data to assess herbivory impacts beyond the plot scale and over longer time-periods; however, these previous studies solely focused on the NDVI. Here we demonstrate the added value of also using GLCM texture measures to investigate effects on a savanna ecosystem in response to presence or absence of herbivores. Combining these data with plot measurements our study demonstrates the benefits of combining field and space perspectives in ecosystem studies.

AB  - Animal carrion, an ephemeral but nutritional resource, supports diverse invertebrate species involved in the decomposition process. Necrophagous flies, as the primary colonisers on carrion, can largely affect the invertebrate community and associated carrion decomposition rates; however, field data integrating different carrion types to examine the effect of fly exclusion are evidently lacking. We conducted a field experiment to investigate the responses of arthropod scavengers and the carrion decomposition rate to fly exclusion using yak carrion and chicken carrion in a Tibetan alpine meadow. Results show that flies (maggots) and necrophagous beetles (Coleoptera: Silphidae) were the predominant scavengers on both yak carrion and chicken carrion in the Tibetan alpine meadow. The responses of maggots, necrophagous beetles and predatory beetles varied with carrion types. Specifically, during the early stage of decomposition, maggots were more abundant on chicken carrion compared to yak carrion, while necrophagous beetles and predatory beetles dominated yak carrion during the late stage. The exclusion of flies significantly decreased the richness and the abundance of arthropods on yak carrion, as well as the decomposition rate of yak carrion. Fly exclusion significantly decreased the abundance of arthropods on chicken carrion but not affected the decomposition rate of chicken carrion. Our findings clearly demonstrate that excluding flies can modify temporal successional traits and structure of scavenger community, as well as decomposition rates of both chicken carrion and yak carrion, albeit with varying effect degrees. This study represents a comprehensive investigation into the influences of necrophagous flies and carrion type on carrion decomposition on the Tibetan Plateau, which holds important implications for understanding necrophilous assemblages.

AB  - Habitat use influences the survival and fitness of animals. Habitat quality and food availability in spring and summer are crucial determinants of ungulate population dynamics, peaking in spring and drastically decreasing in summer in Mediterranean region. Here, over a 2-year period we examine foraging habitat use in both spring and summer of 3 threatened gazelle species living in sympatry in a private reserve in Morocco: Cuvier's Gazelle (Gazella cuvieri), Dama Gazelle (Nanger dama), and Dorcas Gazelle (G. dorcas). We observed differences among species-Cuvier's Gazelle foraged in woodland, Dama Gazelle in grassland, and Dorcas Gazelle in scrubland-with differences being mediated by seasonal effects as all species broadened their foraging habitat use in summer. We observed differences between years in foraging patterns of Dama Gazelle and Dorcas Gazelle, reflecting greater herb and scrub cover in 2018, potentially related to greater rainfall. Given the seasonal and annual differences observed, reductions in rainfall predicted with the progression of changing climatic conditions in the Mediterranean basin would reduce the availability of food resources and heighten the vulnerability of these species. The study illustrates interspecific coexistence through food resource partitioning of the 3 species, contributing to support conservation management actions of their populations in setting up structured reintroduction programs within their range.
   Cuvier's Gazelle (Gazella cuvieri), Dama Gazelle (Nanger dama), and Dorcas Gazelle (G. dorcas) are 3 species that were historically abundant and widely distributed in northern Africa but have declined dramatically in the second half of the 20th century. The Conservation Strategy and Action Plan for Gazelle species in North Africa 2017 to 2026 developed by the International Union of Nature Conservation includes the study of their habitat use to support conservation strategies. We investigated the habitat use of the 3 species when foraging in spring and summer on a private reserve of Morocco. There was spatial segregation and seasonal differences among species. These specific preferences might permit stable coexistence among them and reflect their need for structural habitat diversity, which might be promoted in reforestation programs to improve their survival and coexistence in future reintroduction areas, accounting for climate (rainfall reduction decreases forage availability) and population dynamics.

AB  - 1. When non-native species invade ecosystems, coevolved plant-animal interactions and associated ecological functions are altered, often to the detriment of local biodiversity. While mutualistic interactions can benefit from-and assist with-ecological restoration through the removal of non-native species, community-level changes in antagonistic interactions due to restoration are less well understood. Insect seed predators provide important ecosystem functions, but can also have antagonistic effects through pre- dispersal seed predation which can cause fruit abortion or premature fruit drop, potentially affecting plant community composition.
   2. Here, we used a network approach and data on trophic interactions from a largescale field experiment to investigate the differences in insect seed predator communities between native restored sites (where non-native plants were removed) and unrestored sites dominated by non-native plants on the island of Mahe, Seychelles.
   3. Restored sites contained more individuals and species of seed predators (up by 81% and 50% respectively), and experienced a greater predation intensity (1.06 +/- 0.53 vs. 0.27 +/- 0.09), and predator specialisation compared to unrestored sites. The proportion of predated samples was similar between treatments (similar to 14%). Beta diversity, measured as species and interaction turnover, increased at restored sites.
   4. Synthesis and applications: : Our findings imply that vegetation restoration generates marked biodiversity benefits on native seed predator communities and their interactions. However, removing non-native plants did not result in the elimination of non-native seed predators, which might require targeted control measures. Our results highlight the importance of considering the effects of restoration on antagonistic interactions, in addition to those reported for pollination and seed dispersal services. Management practices should aim to control plant invasions for the conservation of native plant communities that serve as resources and refugia both for mutualists (e.g., seed dispersers and pollinators) and native insect seed-predator antagonists, both of which benefit native ecosystem function.

AB  - The ability to move is essential for animals to find mates, escape predation, and meet energy and water demands. This is especially important across grazing systems where vegetation productivity can vary drastically between seasons or years. With grasslands undergoing significant changes due to climate change and anthropogenic development, there is an urgent need to determine the relative impacts of these pressures on the movement capacity of native herbivores. To measure these impacts, we fitted 36 white-bearded wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) with GPS collars across three study areas in southern Kenya (Amboseli Basin, Athi-Kaputiei Plains, and Mara) to test the relationship between movement (e.g., directional persistence, speed, home range crossing time) and gradients of vegetation productivity (i.e., NDVI) and anthropogenic disturbance. As expected, wildebeest moved the most (21.0 km day(-1); CI: 18.7-23.3) across areas where movement was facilitated by low human footprint and necessitated by low vegetation productivity (Amboseli Basin). However, in areas with moderate vegetation productivity (Athi-Kaputiei Plains), wildebeest moved the least (13.3 km day(-1); CI: 11.0-15.5). This deviation from expectations was largely explained by impediments to movement associated with a large human footprint. Notably, the movements of wildebeest in this area were also less directed than the other study populations, suggesting that anthropogenic disturbance (i.e., roads, fences, and the expansion of settlements) impacts the ability of wildebeest to move and access available resources. In areas with high vegetation productivity and moderate human footprint (Mara), we observed intermediate levels of daily movement (14.2 km day(-1); CI: 12.3-16.1). Wildebeest across each of the study systems used grassland habitats outside of protected areas extensively, highlighting the importance of unprotected landscapes for conserving mobile species. These results provide unique insights into the interactive effects of climate and anthropogenic development on the movements of a dominant herbivore in East Africa and present a cautionary tale for the development of grazing ecosystems elsewhere.

AB  - Monitoring soil erosion in the Arctic tundra is complicated by the highly fragmentated nature of the landscape and the limited spatial resolution of even high-resolution satellite data. The expansion of shrubs across the Arctic has led to substantial changes in vegetation composition that alter the spectral reflectance and directly affect vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is widely applied for environmental monitoring. This change can mask soil erosion if datasets with too coarse spatial resolutions are used, as increases in NDVI driven by shrub expansion can obscure concurrent increases in barren land cover. Here we created land cover maps from a multispectral uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) and land cover survey and assessed satellite imagery from PlanetScope, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 for several areas in north-eastern Iceland. Additionally, we used a novel application of the Shannon evenness index (SHEI) to evaluate levels of pixel mixing. Our results show that shrub expansion can lead to spectral confusion, which can obscure soil erosion processes and emphasize the importance of considering spatial resolution when monitoring highly fragmented landscapes. We demonstrate that remote sensing data with a resolution < 3 m greatly improves the amount of information captured in an Icelandic tundra environment. The spatial resolution of Landsat data (30 m) is inadequate for environmental monitoring in our study area. We found that the best platform for monitoring tundra land cover is Sentinel-2 when used in combination with multispectral UAV acquisitions for validation. Our study has the potential to improve environmental monitoring capabilities by introducing the use of SHEI to assess pixel mixing and determine optimal spatial resolutions. This approach combined with comparing remote sensing imagery of different spatial and time scales significantly advances our comprehension of land cover changes, including greening and soil degradation, in the Arctic tundra.

AB  - Reconstructing the demographic history of endangered taxa is paramount to predict future fluctuations and disentangle the contributing factors. Extinct taxa or populations might also provide key insights in this respect by means of the DNA extracted from museum specimens. Nevertheless, the degraded status of biological material and the limited number of records may pose some constraints. For this reason, identifying all available sources, including private and public biological collections, is a crucial step forward. In this study, we reconstructed the demographic history based on cytochrome-b sequence data of the Pyrenean ibex (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica), a charismatic taxon of the European wildlife that became extinct in the year 2000. Moreover, we built a database of the museum specimens available in public biological collections worldwide and genotyped a privately owned 140-year-old trophy from the Spanish Pyrenees to confirm its origin. We found that the population of the Pyrenean ibex underwent a recent expansion approximately 20,000 years ago, after which trophy hunting and epizootics triggered a relentless population decline. Our interpretations, based on the genetic information currently available in public repositories, provide a solid basis for more exhaustive analyses relying on all the new sources identified. In particular, the adoption of a genome-wide approach appears a fundamental prerequisite to disentangle the multiple contributing factors associated with low genetic diversity, including inbreeding depression, acting as extinction drivers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biological invasions are a leading cause of reductions in global biodiversity. Islands are particularly sensitive to invasions, which often result in cascading impacts throughout island communities. Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are globally invasive and pose threats to numerous taxa and ecosystems, particularly for islands where they have contributed to declines of many endemic species. However, the impacts of wild pig diet on the flora and fauna remain understudied in many island systems. RESULTS: We used DNA metabarcoding of wild pig fecal samples to quantify the seasonal diet composition of wild pigs on three barrier islands in the southeastern United States. Wild pigs exhibited a diverse diet dominated by plants, but also including marine and terrestrial animals. The diet composition of plants varied seasonally and between islands. Consumption of invertebrates also changed seasonally, with a shift to coastal invertebrates, particularly crabs, in spring and summer. Vertebrates were found in <10% of samples, but spanned broad taxa including amphibians, fish, mammals, and reptiles. Species consumed by wild pigs indicate that wild pigs use a variety of habitats within barrier islands for foraging, including maritime forests, saltmarshes, and beaches. CONCLUSIONS: An observed shift to beach foraging during sea turtle nesting season suggests wild pigs have potential to hinder nesting success on islands without established management programs. These findings provide insight into the diverse diets of wild pigs on barrier islands and highlight the need for removal of wild pigs from sensitive island ecosystems because of their potential impacts to native plant and animal communities.

AB  - Herbivore-induced changes in both leaf silicon-based defence and nutrient levels are potential mechanisms through which grazers alter the quality of their own grass supply. In tundra grasslands, herbivores have been shown to increase nutrient contents of grasses; yet, it is an open question whether they also increase grass silicon-based defence levels. Here, we asked if, and to what extent, herbivores affect silicon content and silicon:nutrient ratios of grasses found in tundra grasslands. We performed an herbivore-interaction field-experiment spanning four tundra-grassland sites. At each site, we established reindeer-open and reindeer-exclusion plots in tundra-patches that had been disturbed or not by small rodents during the previous winter, for a total of 96 plots. We randomly collected over 1,150 leaf samples of inherently silicon-rich and silicon-poor grass species throughout a growing season and analysed silicon, nitrogen and phosphorus contents of each leaf. Small-rodent winter disturbance did not affect grass silicon content, but increased grass quality (i.e. lowered silicon:nutrient ratios) by enhancing nutrient levels of both silicon-rich (+20%-22%) and silicon-poor (+26%-34%) grasses. Reindeer summer herbivory increased the quality of silicon-rich grasses by decreasing their silicon content (-7%). However, the two herbivores together offset both these quality increments in silicon-rich grasses, thus reducing their quality towards the level of those found in the absence of herbivores and further enhancing their silicon:nutrient ratios (+13%-22%) relative to silicon-poor grasses. Synthesis. We provide the first community-level, field-based assessment of how herbivory-driven changes in both leaf silicon-based defence and nutrient levels alter grass-forage quality in tundra grasslands. Herbivores did not promote a net silicon accumulation in grasses, but rather enhanced their overall quality. Yet, the magnitude of these quality increments varied depending on the herbivore(s) involved and differed between silicon-rich and silicon-poor grasses. Such differential herbivory-induced changes in grass quality between and within tundra-patches may mediate plant-herbivore interactions by altering herbivore forage patterns and food choices. In tundra-patches utilised by both herbivores, the quality of silicon-rich grasses was further decreased relative to that of silicon-poor grasses. This could provide an advantage against herbivory, potentially being one of the pathways through which tundra-grassland vegetation states dominated by silicon-rich grasses are maintained by herbivores.

AB  - The overabundance of large herbivores can have detrimental effects on the local environment due to overgrazing. Culling is a common management practice implemented globally that can effectively control herbivore populations and allow vegetation communities to recover. However, the broader indirect effects of culling large herbivores remain relatively unknown, particularly on insect species such as ground-dwelling beetles that perform key ecosystem processes such as decomposition. Here we undertook a preliminary investigation to determine how culling sika deer on an island in North Japan impacted ground-beetle community dynamics. We conducted pitfall trapping in July and September in 2012 (before culling) and again in 2019 (after culling). We compared beetle abundance and community composition within 4 beetle families (Carabidae, Scarabaeidae, Geotrupidae, and Silphidae), across seasons and culling treatments. We found each family responded differently to deer culling. Scarabaeidae displayed the greatest decline in abundance after culling. Silphidae also had reduced abundance but to a lesser extent compared to Scarabaeidae. Carabidae had both higher and lower abundance after culling, depending on the season. We found beetle community composition differed between culling and season, but seasonal variability was reduced after culling. Overall, the culling of large herbivores resulted in a reduction of ground-dwelling beetle populations, particularly necrophagous species dependent on dung and carrion for survival. Our preliminary research highlights the need for long-term and large-scale experiments to understand the indirect ecological implications of culling programs on ecosystem processes.

AB  - 1. The use of ecological replacements (analogue species to replace extinct taxa) to restore ecosystem functioning is a promising conservation tool. However, this approach is controversial, in part due to a paucity of data on interactions between analogue species and established taxa in the ecosystem.
   2. We conducted ecological surveys, comprehensively DNA barcoded an ecosystem's flora and inferred the diet of the introduced Aldabra giant tortoise, acting as an ecological replacement, to understand how it might have modified island plant communities on a Mauritian islet. Through further dietary analyses, we investigated consequential effects on the threatened endemic Telfair's skink.
   3. Dietary overlap between tortoises and skinks was greater than expected by chance. However, there was a negative correlation between tortoise and skink preferences in herbivory and minimal overlap in the plants most frequently consumed by the reptiles.
   4. Changes in the plant community associated with 7 years of tortoise grazing were characterised by a decrease in the percentage cover of native herbs and creepers, and an increase in the cover of an invasive herb when compared to areas without tortoises. However, tortoise dietary preferences themselves did not directly drive changes in the plant community.
   5. Tortoises successfully dispersed the seeds of an endemic palm, which in time may increase the extent of unique palm-rich habitat. We found no evidence that tortoises have increased the extent of plant species hypothesised to be part of a lost Mauritian tortoise grazed community.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Due to a negative correlation in tortoise and skink dietary preferences and minimal overlap in the most frequently consumed taxa, the presence of tortoises is unlikely to have detrimental impacts on Telfair's skinks. Tortoise presence is likely to be beneficial to skinks in the long term by increasing the extent of palm-rich habitat. Although tortoises are likely to play a role in controlling invasive plants, they are not a panacea for this challenge. After 7 years, tortoises have not resurrected a lost tortoise grazed community that we hypothesise might have existed in limited areas on the islet, indicating that further interventions may be required to restore this plant community.

AB  - BackgroundSoil nutrient availability is a limiting factor for tundra productivity. Therefore, consumer-driven alteration of nutrient availability can have a large effect on tundra communities. Previous work has demonstrated that Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) act as ecosystem engineers in tundra heath communities by altering plant composition and increasing plant biomass on their dens, which then increases snow depth. To test the ability of increased nutrients and deeper snow to cause the ecosystem effects observed on fox dens, we set up a nutrient addition and snow fencing experiment on tundra heath in Wapusk National Park, Canada.ResultsChanges in experimental plots were mainly driven by fertilizer application, not snow depth. After 2 years, the fertilizer plots were invaded by a dune grass (Elymus mollis), which increased to 12% cover by the end of the experiment, which is typical of fox dens. After 4 years, total plant cover was 26% higher on the fertilizer plots than on the control plots. After 7 years of treatments, the plots receiving both fertilizer and snow fencing had the greatest shift in plant species composition, although they still lacked the tall willow shrubs typical of fox dens. Fertilized plots and dens had five times more arthropods than control plots. Most wildlife, except caribou (Rangifer tarandus), spent more time on fertilized plots in years when they were abundant, with Canada geese (Branta canadensis) being present 20 times longer in fertilizer plots. Collared lemmings (Dicrostonyx richardsoni) also preferred fertilized plots in the summer, but winter use was more pronounced on snow fenced and fertilized plots, where they produced 20 latrines per plot in a peak population year.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that the nutrient limitation in tundra vegetation makes tundra ecosystems vulnerable to changes in nutrient availability, with changes in plant abundance and composition leading to increased animal activity, that has the potential to create a positive feedback in ecosystem productivity.

AB  - Globally, the effective protected area network is one of the last resorts for conserving biodiversity. The nature of protected areas depends on the land ownership of the respective countries including India. The landholding in the northeastern states of India remains with native people, thus, 'Community Reserve' (CR) was introduced in 2003. Considering the high number of CR in Meghalaya that are home to many threatened primates, understanding their role in conserving the primates was crucial. We conducted day and night trail surveys in 32 CR of Meghalaya, and a questionnaire survey of local people for their perception of primates. We sampled basal area, tree density, canopy cover, canopy height, bamboo density, and human activity in each CR to test their influence on the occupancy of primates. We recorded the Western hoolock gibbon Hoolock hoolock, capped langur Trachypithecus pileatus, Northern pig-tailed macaque Macaca leonina, Assamese macaque Macaca assamensis, Rhesus macaque Macaca mulatta, and Bengal slow loris Nycticebus bengalensis. The primate richness and abundance were higher in the CR of Garo Hills than in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills. The gibbons had the highest patch occupancy, which was followed by capped langur, Assamese macaque, and pig-tailed macaque. Large-sized CR determined the occupancy of gibbons and Assamese macaques. Canopy cover positively influenced the occupancy of three primates except the Assamese macaque, whereas the canopy height had a positive association with three species of primates. The basal area, and tree density, negatively affected the occurrence of Assamese macaque, northern pig-tailed macaque, and capped langur. Macaques were the most hunted primates. The differential occurrence and abundance in different hill systems may be due to hunting and habitat size rather than habitat quality. Habitat restoration would improve the habitat quality with the involvement of communities to assist in retaining and avoiding the local extinction of primates.

However, limited information is available on how extinction shaped the phenotype of surviving taxa. Here, based on a global dataset of straight carapace length, we investigate the temporal variation, spatial distribution and evolution of tortoise body size over the past 23 million years, thereby capturing the effects of Quaternary extinctions in this clade. We found a significant change in body size distribution characterized by a reduction of both mean body size and maximum body size of extant tortoises relative to fossil taxa. This reduction of body size occurred earlier in mainland (Early Pleistocene 2.588-0.781 Ma) than in island tortoises (Late Pleistocene/Holocene 0.126-0 Ma). Despite contrasting body size patterns between fossil and extant taxa on a spatial scale, tortoise body size showed limited variation over time until this decline. Body size is a fundamental functional trait determining many aspects of species ecologies, with large tortoises playing key roles as ecosystem engineers. As such, the transition from larger sized to smaller sized classes indicated by our findings likely resulted in the homogenization of tortoises' ecological functions and diminished the role of tortoises in structuring the vegetation community.

AB  - The rapid expansion of invasive wild pig (Sus scrofa) populations over the past several decades has resulted in an increased distribution of damage to native systems throughout their introduced range. Despite the extent of wild pig damage and growing concerns among land managers, there is limited published data regarding the variability of damage in relation to season and fine-scale land cover attributes. We assessed wild pig rooting damage during the winter (January-March) and summer (June-August) of 2020 along 36 km of 10-m-wide transects on the Savannah River Site (SRS) and 34 km of 10-m-wide transects on privately owned agricultural (POA) properties in South Carolina, USA. We recorded fine-scale land cover attributes at damage and control sites to determine the factors that were most closely associated with wild pig rooting damage. We reported 6,825.5 m2 of rooting damage over 36 km of survey transects on the SRS and 3,146.9 m2 of rooting damage over 34 km of survey transects on the POA properties over winter and summer seasons. The average depth of rooting damage was 11.8 cm on the SRS and 11.2 cm on the POA properties. Our modeling results suggested rooting by wild pigs was more likely to occur in earlier winter months, in hardwood stands, proximal to water, and in areas with less ground vegetation and greater stem density, and less likely to occur in areas with greater tree density and near roads. Our results can help facilitate early detection of wild pig expansion by highlighting key areas to monitor for wild pig presence.

AB  - Herbivores affect plants via direct consumption, but also indirectly via changes in the vegetation. These indirect effects may only manifest after decades of exposure and, as a result, their impact is rarely accounted for. To better understand the direct and indirect impacts of a large herbivore, moose (Alces alces), on forests, we measured tree growth in areas that were both subjected to and excluded from herbivory for over 80 years. Growth data were gathered from five tree species, ranging from low to high palatability. We found that at small sizes, Betula papyrifera, a preferred species, benefited from herbivore exclusion. However, larger individuals grew more when exposed to herbivory, a response we attribute to lower competition in heavily browsed conditions. Populus tremuloides, a highly preferred tree, did not show any differences between levels of herbivory. Abies balsamea, a preferred winter browsed, was only marginally affected by browsing at smaller sizes. The two non-preferred species, Picea glauca and Picea mariana, did not show differential growth between herbivory levels. We conclude that herbivores can impact forests through both direct and indirect effects, that these effects are size specific, and that effects vary among species in ways not always predicted by consumption patterns.

AB  - Small burrowing herbivores play a crucial role in maintaining structure and function of grassland ecosystems. To date, our understanding of whether practicing ecological uniqueness can enhance plant diversity conservation under small herbivore disturbances remains limited. Here, we investigate the ecological uniqueness of plant communities, which include habitats disturbed and undisturbed by plateau pikas. In 30 geographic regions of alpine grasslands, plateau pikas lead to plant assemblages that differ from those in undisturbed habitats and reduce the ecological uniqueness. During this process, plant turnover dominate the changes in ecological uniqueness. In the presence of plateau pika, the influence of altitude is diminished, with plant relative abundance, species richness, and functional richness measurements emerging as core predictors of ecological uniqueness. Notably, the negative effect of relative abundance on ecological uniqueness shifts to a positive effect, supporting the status of the plateau pika as ecosystem engineers at larger spatial scales. A combined beta regression model incorporating bare patch areas and active burrow entrances explains 46% of the variation in the ecological uniqueness. Given the limited resources available for conservation, we propose prioritizing the protection of undisturbed and low-intensity plateau pika habitats, rather than pursuing eradication. Additionally, near-natural restoration (e.g., controlling pika populations, sustainable grazing) in highly disturbed habitats is crucial for maintaining ecological uniqueness. This study provides new insights into the roles of small burrowing herbivores at the regional scale, which can guide grassland conservation efforts.

AB  - Grazing is well-known to shape plant populations and plant communities and to affect several compartment characteristics of grazed ecosystems. Semi-natural grassland conservation depends on the maintenance of traditional extensive grazing systems which can exist for centuries, even millennia. However, very few studies have concomitantly investigated the effect of grazing management on plant, forage, litter and soil compartments and the implications of their potential interactions for conservation after recent changes in grazing practices.This study thus aimed to identify the concomitant effects of sheep grazing on the latter compartments of Mediterranean grasslands. We further investigated the effects of a recent change from millenia-old traditional herding to contemporary fenced free grazing. We also sought to determine how this change may impact the agronomic and ecological value of these grasslands.Surveys were carried out at 6 different study sites paired by the two different grazing practices in a French Mediterranean sub-steppic vegetation ("Crau" plain in Southeastern France).Using linear models and distance-based redundancy analysis, effects of grazing intensity, grazing practices and their interactions were tested on plant community, forage, litter and soil physicochemical properties. Our results show that, there was a significant effect of grazing intensity on the four studied compartments, with significantly higher species richness and evenness at moderate grazing intensity. Biomass was also significantly higher at moderate grazing intensity. Digestibility of forage, litter quality and soil fertility decreased significantly under less intensive grazing. Significant differences were also found in the relative size of the areas covered by each plant communities. Recent fenced free grazing led to significantly more intensively grazed zones, with more mesophilous/nitrophilous vegetation. Conversely, in zones traditionally less intensively grazed, the contempo-rary free grazing led to higher plant species-richness but again with more mesophilous species. Implications for conservation management are that the legacy of millennia-old traditional herding still compensates partly for the effects of changing practice to contemporary fenced free grazing on plant community composition but not on their relative sizes. This indicates an increase in grazing intensity in the remotest zone which could lead to grassland plant community homogenization.

AB  - With their unique ecosystems and evolutionary dynamics, small islands offer fascinating contexts to explore animal diversity. Island bats are key players in maintaining ecological balance. However, their populations are threatened worldwide, necessitating comprehensive research and conservation strategies. Pantelleria, a small Mediterranean island and a biogeographic crossroad between Europe and Africa, offers an excellent model to exemplify the challenges to bat conservation in such geographic contexts. We tested three hypotheses: (1) bats would show weak preference patterns for landscape composition due to the island's heterogeneous landscapes, (2) farmland (especially vineyards) would strongly affect bat activity, and (3) distance from water sources would highly influence bat richness and activity. We surveyed bats acoustically using Audiomoth recorders covering most of the island's surface. We recorded seven bat species, including endangered Plecotus gaisleri, Myotis punicus and Rhinolophus mehelyi. Bats showed weak preferences for specific landscape composition, but the dominant species (Pipistrellus kuhlii) decreased its activity for increasing portions of vineyards within the landscape. Moreover, distance to water critically influenced bat richness and activity. Agricultural expansion, pesticide use and human activities pose significant threats to bats on Pantelleria. We advocate for sustainable farming practices and careful water resource management to safeguard bat habitats and mitigate these threats. Conservation should target vineyards, a key economic resource to produce world-renowned wine 'Passito di Pantelleria' by reducing pesticide use and adopting organic management. Water might be supplemented in critical dry habitats. We urge the preservation of bat diversity to support ecosystem health and resilience on small islands like Pantelleria.

AB  - Large herbivores have an outsized influence on ecosystem structure and function but are declining globally. In managed forests, shrub planting is commonly used to improve habitat for large herbivores, but success of this approach has been mixed. Despite the time and cost involved, planting efforts often fail to establish viable shrub communities, underscoring the need to understand factors that govern interactions between large herbivores and planted shrubs. We evaluated whether and to what degree herbivory during winter limited performance of planted shrubs in a forest managed as winter range for North American elk (Cervus canadensis). Using long-term herbivory exclosures (n = 5) and a before-after-control-impact design, we assessed (1) the nature and magnitude of shrub responses to winter herbivory during the subsequent growing season, and (2) relationships between shrub size (i.e., height, volume) and ability to replace biomass lost to herbivores during winter. Consistent with herbivore optimization theory, shrubs responded positively to winter browsing by producing longer shoots and concomitantly more biomass during the subsequent growing season. However, this response was contingent on shrubs surpassing mean minimum size thresholds prior to being exposed to herbivory. These results indicate that identifying such thresholds and allowing planted shrubs to reach them before being exposed to herbivory could help improve the effectiveness of habitat management for large herbivores. For example, the use of low-cost fencing to temporarily protect young shrubs from browsing, or the planting of older, larger shrubs could lead to more consistent success in establishing viable shrub communities in managed forests.

AB  - Isolated, seasonal wetlands within agricultural landscapes are important ecosystems. However, they are currently experiencing direct and indirect effects of agricultural management surrounding them. Because wetlands provide important ecosystem services, it is crucial to determine how these factors affect ecological communities. Here, we studied the long-term effects of land-use intensification, cattle grazing, prescribed fires, and their interactions on wetland plant diversity, community dynamics, and functional diversity. To do this, we used vegetation and trait data from a 14-year-old experiment on 40 seasonal wetlands located within seminatural and intensively managed pastures in Florida. These wetlands were allocated different grazing and prescribed fire treatments (grazed vs. ungrazed, burned vs. unburned). Our results showed that wetlands within intensively managed pastures have lower native plant diversity, floristic quality, evenness, and higher nonnative species diversity and exhibited the most resource-acquisitive traits. Wetlands embedded in intensively managed pastures were also characterized by lower species turnover over time. We found that 14 years of cattle exclusion reduced species diversity in both pasture management intensities and had no effect on floristic quality. Fenced wetlands exhibited lower functional diversity and experienced a higher rate of community change, both due to an increase in tall, clonal, and palatable grasses. The effects of prescribed fires were often dependent on grazing treatment. For instance, prescribed fires increased functional diversity in fenced wetlands but not in grazed wetlands. Our study suggests that cattle exclusion and prescribed fires are not enough to restore wetlands in intensively managed pastures and further highlights the importance of not converting seminatural pastures to intensively managed pastures. Our study also suggests that grazing levels applied in seminatural pastures maintained high plant diversity and prevented tree and shrub encroachment and that in the absence of grazing, prescribed fire became crucial to maintaining higher species evenness.

AB  - Species overexploitation has simplified food webs worldwide, resulting in the degradation of ecosystems relative to their natural state. Fishes are the most important herbivores in many shallow coral reef environments, where they control algal successional processes and promote coral reef resilience. Nowadays, Rapa Nui (Easter Island) is suffering a severe decline in its nearshore fish populations due to overfishing. In this study, we used artificial underwater settlement plates with different levels of herbivore exclusion, and underwater visual censuses, for eight consecutive months to examine the functional role of herbivorous fishes in the coastal benthic community of Rapa Nui. Fishes effectively controlled fleshy erect algae growth along the west and north coast of the island. In total exclusion treatments, Codium spp. dominated settlement plates, showing a likely late successional stage when no herbivory occurred. Significant differences in fish biomass were observed across sites, suggesting a possible fishing gradient. The results of this study can help to inform various spatial and temporal management strategies to increase the protection of nearshore fishes at the recently created Rapa Nui multiple-use marine protected area.

AB  - ContextUnderstanding how forest disturbances, such as fire and herbivory, affect carbon storage across the landscape can help inform forest management and disturbance mitigation. However, this is made difficult by uncertainties in carbon predictions and limited records of disturbance histories.ObjectivesOur objectives were to predict carbon stocks and predict where disturbances have created open forest patches across the study areas, and to assess the relative effects of disturbances and subsequent moose herbivory on carbon stocks.MethodsWe used field measurements of carbon stocks and disturbances from a two-year field study on the island of Newfoundland, Canada, along with remotely sensed environmental variables (e.g., stand height, elevation), to predict spatial patterns in carbon stocks as well as predict where disturbances have created open forest across Gros Morne and Terra Nova National Parks.ResultsWe found that the remotely sensed variables of forest height and productivity were the most informative predictor variables for both carbon stocks and whether an area was an open forest. Our models predict less carbon in areas classified as open forest relative to areas classified as mature forest. Further, we observed that moose herbivory may impede the recovery of carbon stocks in open forests after disturbances, leading to a reduction in carbon storage of up to 13 megatonnes, or 40% of carbon predicted to be stored across the two national parks.ConclusionsOverall, we find there is potential to increase or maintain carbon storage in maritime boreal forests by limiting moose herbivory in areas regenerating following disturbance. This work adds to our understanding of drivers of forest carbon storage and can help inform boreal forest management to optimize carbon storage.

AB  - Understanding fire and large herbivore interactions in interior western forests is critical, owing to the extensive and widespread co-occurrence of these two disturbance types and multiple present and future implications for forest resilience, conservation and restoration. However, manipulative studies focused on interactions and outcomes associated with these two disturbances are rare in forested rangelands. We investigated understory vegetation response to 5-year spring and fall prescribed fire and domestic cattle grazing exclusion in ponderosa pine stands and reported long-term responses, almost two decades after the first entry fires. In fall burn areas open to cattle grazing, total understory cover prior to utilization was about 12% lower compared with fall burn areas where cattle were experimentally excluded. This response was not strongly driven by a particular palatable or unpalatable plant functional group. Fire and grazing are likely interacting in a numerically mediated process, as we found little evidence to support a functionally moderated pathway. Post-fire green-up may equalize forage to a certain extent and concentrate herbivores in the smaller burned areas within pastures, constraining a positive understory response to burning. Fall fire and grazing also increased annual forbs and resprouting shrubs. The effects of spring burning were relatively minor, and we found no interaction with grazing. The nonnative annual grass Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) remains a problematic invader linked to fall burning but not grazing in stands that had higher propagule pressure when the experiment was initiated. At these sites, exotic grass was a major component of the vegetation by 2015, and invasion was also increasing in spring burn and unburned areas. Information from our study suggests that frequent fall fires and cattle grazing combined may reduce understory resilience in similar dry ponderosa pine forests. Consideration of longer fire return intervals, resting areas after fire, virtual fencing, or burning entire pastures may help to mitigate the effects noted in this study.

AB  - Sedentarization of pastoralist communities is reshaping the structure and functioning of tropical savannas. Of particular concern is how permanent pastoral settlements change grassland vegetation inside "protected" areas. In this study, we investigate the spatial impact of pastoral settlements on grassland regrowth in Nech Sar National Park, Ethiopia. Within the National Park, we established herbivore exclosures across the central grassland plains at varying distances from a high concentration of pastoral settlements. Plant species composition, biomass, and regrowth after clipping were measured every 6 months, inside and outside exclosures in close proximity and further away from pastoral settlements. After 18 months, close proximity to high densities of pastoral settlements negatively influenced grassland regrowth compared to further away from pastoral settlements. Excluding herbivores resulted in lower regrowth compared to grazed swards independent of distance from high densities of pastoral settlements. Cover of the dominant grass species Bothriochloa insculpta was lower when grazed and following clipping, whereas Chrysopogon plumulosus cover was higher closer to settlements. These grasses were dominant across the plain; yet further away from settlements there was a higher number of co--dominant grassland species. These findings suggest that subtle changes in grassland community composition, likely following livestock grazing, contribute to spatial differences in savanna grassland regrowth near to and far from pastoral settlements. Furthermore, specific grassland species may be used as indicators of the wider spatial impact of pastoral settlement sedentarization on savanna regrowth.

AB  - The Tragelaphini, also known as spiral-horned antelope, is a phenotypically diverse mammalian tribe comprising a single genus, Tragelaphus. The evolutionary history of this tribe has attracted the attention of taxonomists and molecular geneticists for decades because its diversity is characterised by conflicts between morphological and molecular data as well as between mitochondrial, nuclear and chromosomal DNA. These inconsistencies point to a complex history of ecological diversification, coupled by either phenotypic convergence or introgression. Therefore, to unravel the phylogenetic relationships among spiral-horned antelopes, and to further investigate the role of divergence and gene flow in trait evolution, we sequenced genomes for all nine accepted species of the genus Tragelaphus, including a genome each for the highly divergent bushbuck lineages (T. s. scriptus and T. s. sylvaticus). We successfully reconstructed the Tragelaphus species tree, providing genome-level support for the early Pliocene divergence and monophyly of the nyala (T. angasii) and lesser kudu (T. imberbis), the monophyly of the two eland species (T. oryx and T. derbianus) and, importantly, the monophyly of ke<acute accent>wel (T. s. scriptus) and imbabala (T. s. sylvaticus) bushbuck. We found strong evidence for gene flow in at least four of eight nodes on the species tree. Among the six phenotypic traits assessed here, only habitat type mapped onto the species tree without homoplasy, showing that trait evolution was the result of complex patterns of divergence, introgression and convergent evolution.

AB  - Effective wildlife conservation requires decomposing the drivers of population dynamics for species affected by anthropogenic habitat alterations. Ungulates are often the focus of management actions to restore habitat and maintain connectivity as they are sensitive to landscape disturbances. We used Bayesian proportional hazards models to assess anthropogenic risk factors that could potentially predict landscape-scale survivorship for pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) in the Northern Sagebrush Steppe ecosystem, where extensive habitat alterations occurred from the conversion of native sagebrush grasslands to agricultural lands. Using 170 adult female pronghorn monitored from 2003 to 2011, we tested the importance of linear features (road and fence densities) and forage productivity (maximum decadal normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]) for spatiotemporal pronghorn mortality risk, while accounting for a seasonally varying proxy of snow depth. We found moderate support for the effects of linear features on mortality risk as coefficient estimates translated to predicted declines in survivorship of 27.1% over the observed range of road densities (0-1.4 km/km(2)) and 11.8% over the range of fence densities (0-6.1 km/km(2)) encountered by pronghorn. Our results also suggested that agricultural areas could act as ecological traps for pronghorn, based on mortality risk increasing by a factor of 14.3% with every 0.1 increase in maximum decadal NDVI in summer (range = 0.38-0.73). Like our previous findings, we found considerable support for the effects of average depth (in centimeters) of snow water equivalent (SWE; SWE depth = snow depth x snow density/water density) within pronghorn seasonal ranges, with mortality risk increasing by 45.7% with every 1 cm increase in SWE depth (range = 0-5.37 cm). We then developed the first broadscale, spatially explicit map of predicted annual pronghorn survivorship based on anthropogenic features and environmental gradients to identify areas for conservation and habitat restoration efforts. These efforts to highlight anthropogenic risk factors on the landscape will hopefully support conservation and habitat restoration for pronghorn populations at the northern periphery of their range.

AB  - Conservation strategies for huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus), listed as an endangered cervid by IUCN, have not helped to reverse its declining population trends. Recent evaluations of historical data revealed that they also inhabited lower valleys and grasslands as residents or only during winter. However, the dogma persists that huemuls do not need such habitats. To determine if more solid evidence exists to back up or refute our hypothesis that huemuls once inhabited lower valleys and grasslands, we researched the literature and discovered additional relevant historical sources on this species. These new findings substantiate that huemuls also occupied unforested areas, reaching the Atlantic coast, and resided on various islands including Tierra del Fuego, and that their co-occurrence with guanaco was frequent. Their extreme naivety towards humans resulted in their extirpation on winter ranges settled by humans, resulting in refugee huemuls year-round on remote mountain summer ranges. The ease by which indigenous people could kill them for subsistence and commercial export of hides to Europe, followed by the lowlands becoming modified by settlers and their exotic species facilitated the huemuls' extirpation. The hypothesis of a dramatic modification of the original biogeographical distribution of huemuls is supported by anatomical and ecological features along with historical accounts. Sedentariness on only rugged summer ranges makes long-term survival of this species crucially challenging and requires sound conservation strategies that incorporate geographical areas of their former distribution.

AB  - A significant challenge of global change is the human-mediated movement of pasture grasses and their subsequent impact on ecosystem processes when they become invasive. We must understand invasive grass ecology and their natural enemies in native and introduced ranges to mitigate these impacts. Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus) is a pantropically introduced pasture grass that escapes intended areas and invades native ecosystems - threatening biodiversity and ecosystem function. The success of invasive plants has of-ten been attributed to ecological release from stressors, including natural enemies and resource availability. Our objective was to assess Guinea grass functional traits across three different habitat types in native and invaded ranges by documenting ungulate and arthropod abundance, diversity, and feeding guilds. Guinea grass functional traits were assessed in three habitat types: grassland, riparian, and woody thickets around nitrogen-fixing Prosopis glandulosa in its introduced range in Texas, USA, and Senegalia mellifera in its native range in Kenya. We characterized Guinea grass functional traits by measuring plant height, cover, biomass, root-to-shoot ratios, and reproductive traits. We then examined the phytophagous arthropod and ungulate abundance and feeding guild diversity across the three habitat types. We hypothesized that functional trait expression related to invasiveness would be associated with Guinea grass in its introduced range. Also, we hypothesized that the abundance and diversity of phytophagous arthropods and ungulates would be lower in the invaded range. Finally, we hypothesized that Guinea grass functional traits would differ between the three habitat types, given the habitat types' innate differences in resource availability. We found that Guinea grass was 2.5 times taller and 3.3 times more productive and covered 2.5 times more area in its invaded versus native ranges. Introduced Guinea grass had higher reproduction rates with 2.5 times more reproductive tillers, while habitat type drove vegetative reproduction with 15 times more stoloniferous establishment in wooded and riparian sites than grasslands. Texan ungulate communities were less species-rich, less functionally diverse, and less abundant than the Kenyan ungulate community. The phytophagous arthropod diversity on plants was twice as high on Kenyan Guinea grass than on Texan Guinea grass. Total arthropod family richness was nearly double, with 15 families represented in Kenya and 8 in Texas. These results suggest that Guinea grass has escaped a rich assemblage of arthropods and ungulates and likely explains some of its spread in introduced ranges. This study demonstrates how the invasive success of Guinea grass can be understood in terms of its competitive ability and interaction with natural enemies in the introduced and native ranges and may inform future biological control.

AB  - Diverse communities of large mammalian herbivores (LMH), once widespread, are now rare. LMH exert strong direct and indirect effects on community structure and ecosystem functions, and measuring these effects is important for testing ecological theory and for understanding past, current, and future environmental change. This in turn requires long-term experimental manipulations, owing to the slow and often nonlinear responses of populations and assemblages to LMH removal. Moreover, the effects of particular species or body-size classes within diverse LMH guilds are difficult to pinpoint, and the magnitude and even direction of these effects often depends on environmental context. Since 2008, we have maintained the Ungulate Herbivory Under Rainfall Uncertainty (UHURU) experiment, a series of size-selective LMH exclosures replicated across a rainfall/productivity gradient in a semiarid Kenyan savanna. The goals of the UHURU experiment are to measure the effects of removing successively smaller size classes of LMH (mimicking the process of size-biased extirpation) and to establish how these effects are shaped by spatial and temporal variation in rainfall. The UHURU experiment comprises three LMH-exclusion treatments and an unfenced control, applied to nine randomized blocks of contiguous 1-ha plots (n = 36). The fenced treatments are MEGA (exclusion of megaherbivores, elephant and giraffe), MESO (exclusion of herbivores >= 40 kg), and TOTAL (exclusion of herbivores >= 5 kg). Each block is replicated three times at three sites across the 20-km rainfall gradient, which has fluctuated over the course of the experiment. The first 5 years of data were published previously (Ecological Archives E095-064) and have been used in numerous studies. Since that publication, we have (1) continued to collect data following the original protocols, (2) improved the taxonomic resolution and accuracy of plant and small-mammal identifications, and (3) begun collecting several new data sets. Here, we present updated and extended raw data from the first 12 years of the UHURU experiment (2008-2019). Data include daily rainfall data throughout the experiment; annual surveys of understory plant communities; annual censuses of woody-plant communities; annual measurements of individually tagged woody plants; monthly monitoring of flowering and fruiting phenology; every-other-month small-mammal mark-recapture data; and quarterly large-mammal dung surveys. There are no copyright restrictions; notification of when and how data are used is appreciated and users of UHURU data should cite this data paper when using the data.

AB  - Under increasing human activity in Arctic areas and in the face of global climate change, the study of Arctic communities and ecosystems is becoming more and more relevant. However, the question of the impact of interspecific interactions in their transformation remains unresolved. The paper deals with an analysis of diet selectivity of Wrangel Island lemming, goose and ruminant species, also with an estimation of the selectivity influence on their long-term community dynamics and the entire tundra ecosystem functioning. It was shown that the herbivore selectivity distribution mainly depends on their morphophisiology and that, under equal conditions, lesser selective feeders become dominant with increasing biodiversity. We conclude that, despite the considerable human impact on the composition of herbivore species on the island, their mainly endogenous dynamics of abundance distribution correspond to ecological succession, in which the total herbivore biomass decreased by half and their total phytomass consumption-and likely the whole primary production-decreased more than fourfold.

AB  - AimThe distribution of birds among islands is thought to be regulated by island physical geography (i.e. island area, isolation and latitude). In contrast, work on continents indicates that bird diversity is often regulated by plant diversity. Consequently, the (statistical) direct and indirect effects of physical geography on island bird distribution are poorly understood. We investigated the relative roles of physical geography and vegetation in determining island bird diversity in the South West Pacific at two taxonomic scales of resolution: total bird diversity and bird diversity within functional guilds.LocationEleven archipelagos in the South West Pacific.TaxonLand birds.MethodsWe created a dataset characterising total and functional guild diversity for land birds and seed plants (i.e. Spermatophytes) among archipelagos. We then used mediation analysis to disentangle the direct and indirect (i.e. mediated) effects of physical geography and vegetation on bird diversity.ResultsOn a broad taxonomic scale, total bird diversity was directly determined by total plant diversity, not the area, isolation or latitude of islands. On a fine taxonomic scale results differed between functional guilds. The diversity of herbivorous and frugivorous birds was directly determined by physical geography rather than plant total and trait diversity. Woody and herbaceous plant species diversity mediated the effect of physical geography on forest-dwelling, above ground nesting and ground nesting bird diversity. Granivorous, nectarivorous and grassland-dwelling bird diversities were unrelated to both physical geography and herbaceous plant diversity.Main ConclusionsPhysical geography and vegetation can have both direct and indirect effects on island bird diversity. Furthermore, relationships between physical geography, vegetation and bird diversity can vary markedly among functional guilds.

AB  - The extinction of 80% of megaherbivore (>1,000 kg) species towards the end of the Pleistocene altered vegetation structure, fire dynamics and nutrient cycling world-wide. Ecologists have proposed (re)introducing megaherbivores or their ecological analogues to restore lost ecosystem functions and reinforce extant but declining megaherbivore populations. However, the effects of megaherbivores on smaller herbivores are poorly understood. We used long-term exclusion experiments and multispecies hierarchical models fitted to dung counts to test (a) the effect of megaherbivores (elephant and giraffe) on the occurrence (dung presence) and use intensity (dung pile density) of mesoherbivores (2-1,000 kg), and (b) the extent to which the responses of each mesoherbivore species was predictable based on their traits (diet and shoulder height) and phylogenetic relatedness. Megaherbivores increased the predicted occurrence and use intensity of zebras but reduced the occurrence and use intensity of several other mesoherbivore species. The negative effect of megaherbivores on mesoherbivore occurrence was stronger for shorter species, regardless of diet or relatedness. Megaherbivores substantially reduced the expected total use intensity (i.e. cumulative dung density of all species) of mesoherbivores, but only minimally reduced the expected species richness (i.e. cumulative predicted occurrence probabilities of all species) of mesoherbivores (by <1 species). Simulated extirpation of megaherbivores altered use intensity by mesoherbivores, which should be considered during (re)introductions of megaherbivores or their ecological proxies. Species' traits (in this case shoulder height) may be more reliable predictors of mesoherbivores' responses to megaherbivores than phylogenetic relatedness, and may be useful for predicting responses of data-limited species.

AB  - The magnitude of facilitation by shelter-building engineers on community structure is expected to be greater when they increase limited resources in the environment. We evaluated the influence of local environmental context on the colonisation of leaf shelters by arthropods in a Mexican evergreen tropical rainforest. We compared the species richness and abundance of arthropods (total and for different guilds) colonising artificially rolled leaves in habitats differing in understory heterogeneity (forest edge > old-growth forests > living fences). Arthropod abundance of the most representative arthropod taxa (i.e., Araneae, Blattodea, Collembola and Psocoptera) colonising the rolled leaves was greater at forest edge, a trend also observed for average arthropod abundance, and for detritivore and predator guilds. In addition, fewer arthropod species and individuals colonised the rolled leaves in the living fence habitat, a trend also observed for most arthropod guilds. As forest edge is expected to have a greater arthropod diversity and stronger density-dependent interactions, a greater limitation of refuges from competitors or predators may have determined the higher colonisation of the rolled leaves in this habitat. Our results demonstrate that local environment context is an important factor that affects the colonisation of arthropods in leaf shelters.

AB  - Top-down and bottom-up factors and their interaction highlight the interdependence of resources and consumer impacts on food webs and ecosystems. Variation in the strength of upwelling-mediated ecological controls (i.e., light availability and herbivory) between early and late succession stages is less well understood from the standpoint of influencing algal functional group composition. We experimentally tested the effect of light, grazing, and disturbance on rocky intertidal turf-forming algal communities. Studies were conducted on the South Island of New Zealand at Raramai on the east coast (a persistent downwelling region) and Twelve Mile Beach on the west coast (an intermittent upwelling region). Herbivory, light availability, and algal cover were manipulated and percent cover of major macroalgal functional groups and sessile invertebrates were measured monthly from October 2017 to March 2018. By distinguishing between algal functional groups and including different starting conditions in our design, we found that the mosaic-like pattern of bare rock intermingled with diverse turf-forming algae at Twelve Mile Beach was driven by a complex array of species interactions, including grazing, predation, preemptive competition and interference competition, colonization rates, and these interactions were modulated by light availability and other environmental conditions. Raramai results contrasted with those at Twelve Mile Beach in showing stronger effects of grazing and relatively weak effects of other interactions, low colonization rates of invertebrates, and light effects limited to crustose algae. Our study highlights the potential importance of an upwelling-mediated 3-way interaction among herbivory, light availability, and preemption in structuring contrasting low rocky intertidal macroalgal communities.
   Variation in the strength of upwelling-mediated ecological controls (i.e., light availability and herbivory) between early and late succession stages is less well understood from the standpoint of influencing algal functional group composition. Studies were conducted on the South Island of New Zealand at Raramai on the east coast (a persistent downwelling region) and Twelve Mile Beach on the west coast (an intermittent upwelling region). Herbivory, light availability, and algal cover were measured. By distinguishing between algal functional groups and including different starting conditions in our design, we found that Twelve Mile Beach was driven by a complex array of species interactions, including grazing, predation, preemptive competition and interference competition, colonization rates, and these interactions were modulated by light availability and other environmental conditions. Raramai results contrasted with those at Twelve Mile Beach in showing stronger effects of grazing and relatively weak effects of other interactions, low colonization rates of invertebrates, and light effects limited to crustose algae.image

AB  - Browsing on tree ferns (Cyathea australis and Dicksonia antarctica) was assessed at Mt Toolebewong, Victoria, Australia, where a population of Sambar (Rusa unicolor), a large deer species, is known to occur and compared with tree fern browsing at Tarra-Bulga National Park, Victoria, where Sambar are uncommon. At Mt Toolebewong, 52% of surveyed tree ferns had been browsed, with most damage occurring on individuals up to 130 cm high and typically involving removal of most or all of a frond to the base of the rachis. In contrast, only 7% of tree ferns had been browsed at Tarra-Bulga, with none browsed above 85 cm and only the frond tips removed. Browsing of whole fronds on mid-size tree ferns at Mt Toolebewong is attributed to the population of Sambar, and the lower intensity of browsing on smaller tree ferns at Tarra-Bulga to native herbivores. Populations of Sambar in wet forests of south-eastern Australia may, therefore, hinder recruitment of tree ferns into larger size-classes, at least at sites where tree ferns are favoured browse. The potential ecological consequences and management implications are discussed. Information is lacking on the severity and spatial scale over which deer impact tree fern populations. Tree fern browsing may be locally severe with site- and height-based browse evidence suggesting that this can largely be attributed to introduced Sambar. Browsing by deer has the potential to decrease growth, reduce survival and prevent recruitment of tree ferns into larger class sizes, with potentially detrimental implications for tree fern populations, associated species such as epiphytic flora, and the structure and function of wet forest ecosystems. Collection of appropriate field data will provide a better understanding of tree fern browsing and identify if and where management intervention is required.

AB  - Tropical coral reef fish assemblages in the South China Sea (SCS) have not been well-studied; thus, this research investigated the species richness of coral reef fishes at Pulau Bidong and the surrounding islands of Terengganu, Malaysia. Fish surveys were conducted using the Stereo-Diver Operated Video System (Stereo-DOVs) technique from July to October 2019 at 14 sites with different underwater reef structural features. A total of 8259 individuals and 52 reef fish species belonging to 14 families with a density of 23.597 ind. m(-3) were identified and counted from the surveys. Among the families, Scaridae (parrotfish-herbivore), Labridae (wrasse-invertivore), Serranidae (grouper-carnivore), Lutjanidae (snapper-carnivore), and Chaetodontidae (butterflyfish-corallivore) were commonly recognized as indicator fishes for reef health. Based on trophic groups, the proportion of herbivores was significantly highest (51%), followed by carnivores (26%), invertivores (21%) and corallivores (2%). Among the indicator species, Scarus psittacus (Scaridae-parrotfish; Common Parrotfish, 0.829 ind. m(-3)) was predominant, followed by Lutjanus lutjanus (Lutjanidae-snapper; Bigeye Snapper, 0.463 ind. m(-3)) and Thalassoma lunare (Labridae-wrasse; Moon Wrasse, 0.229 ind. m(-3)). The fish communities found at each station were 80% similar between locations. The density at each station ranged from 0.280 to 4.834 ind. m(-3), the diversity index (H ') recorded was between 2.186 and 3.492 and evenness (J ') ranged from 0.610 to 0.862. The high abundance and diversity and significant proportion of indicator fishes might indicate that the coral reef ecosystems at Pulau Bidong and surrounding islands are in good condition. This study offers significant ecological data on fish assemblages of tropical coral reef ecosystems, specifically in the SCS region on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia.

AB  - Pollinators contribute to the establishment of perennial native forages, but little is known about the effect of grazing practices on pollinator abundance and diversity in livestock pasture ecosystems. Grazing reduces floral resources available to bees and other insects, and as a result, may influence their communities. The main objective of this study was to examine the impact of sheep grazing on bees and other non-bee insects in livestock pasture established with seed mixes of native forb/legume/grass and warm season grasses. Each pasture was divided into two halves (in a split-plot design) using an electric fence in which one plot was grazed and the other plot was non-grazed. Blue vane traps and a pair of yellow and blue pan traps were used for sampling bees and non-bee insects. A diverse array of bees (59 species) and non-bee insects (at least 93 species) were found in the livestock pastures. The abundance, diversity, and evenness of bee and non-bee communities were greater in nongrazed plots as compared to grazed plots. However, species richness, as measured by rates of species accumulation relative to sampling effort, was not different among treatments. Results show that a diverse community of bees and non-bee insects may be found in livestock pasture systems, but reduction in bee and non-bee insect diversity in grazed areas highlight the importance of strategic pasture management to support persistence of native forages and sufficient floral resources for pollinators at relevant scales.

AB  - Across southern Africa artificial waterholes have been introduced into many national parks to reduce the pressure of water scarcity on animals during drought. However, their introduction can shift ecological dynamics, and many artificial waterholes are now being removed. As global temperatures rise, droughts are predicted to become more frequent and more severe. Whether to retain or remove artificial waterholes thus presents a management dilemma. Here, we examine the effect of an extreme drought on artificial waterhole use in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Comparing camera trap data collected during a one-in-twenty year drought with observation from a non-drought year, we quantify shifts in waterhole visitation patterns between years. The majority of the species show differences in waterhole use between drought and non-drought years. Species showing the largest temporal shifts include kudu and white rhinoceros, whereas elephants and warthogs show little change between years. Temporal overlaps between species pairs were also highly shifted, with the majority of species overlapping more in drought years, although some (e.g. buffalo and impala) show the opposite trend. Asynchronous shifts in species daily activity cycle may have cascading impacts on interspecific competition, predator-prey interactions, and multi-host disease dynamics. Our study illustrates how the interaction between drought and management choices to mitigate impacts of climate change may have complex and unforeseen ecological consequences. We show that, during drought, artificial waterholes are visited more frequently, likely increasing the frequency of interspecific interactions, including between ungulate herbivores and their predators, and elevating risk of disease spillover.

AB  - Understanding the factors regulating temporal variation in grassland annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) is dominated by studying the effects of climate, particularly water, in ungrazed grassland. However, the overwhelming majority of the Earth's grasslands are grazed by large herbivores, which have large effects on ANPP and interact with climate in unknown ways. Here, we analyzed an eight-year dataset of ANPP across a 26-year period that included widely variable climatic conditions and consumption rates by herds of elk (Cervus elaphus), bison (Bison bison), and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) at 25 grassland sites in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). We found that ANPP was primarily a positive function of consumption rate and secondarily affected by a nonlinear temperature effect, with ANPP declining in hot years. Water balance (WB, a measure of soil moisture available to plants) had no significant effect on ANPP. Examining the difference between grazed minus ungrazed (fenced) ANPP (i.e., grazer stimulation) at 13 grassland sites revealed that herbivores increased average ANPP by 20%, with variation across sites and years driven by the amount grazed, temperature, and interactions of temperature with local environment and WB. We found a surprising negative main effect of WB on ANPP stimulation, likely because grazing ameliorated moisture stress in dry years by reducing transpirational moisture loss. Our results demonstrate that Yellowstone grazers override the well-documented positive effect of moisture on grassland ANPP, which highlights the need to understand how together climate and herbivory regulate production in the world's other grassland ecosystems.

AB  - Predator-prey relationships are of great significance to ecosystems, and their effects on the population dynamics of voles and lemmings (Microtinae) in Boreal and Arctic environments have long been of particular interest. A simple ecosystem with one major prey and one major predator could be an ideal setting for a study of their interactions. This is the situation on several small islands on the coast of northern Norway just below the Arctic Circle, with populations of water voles Arvicola amphibius preyed upon by the eagle owl Bubo bubo. The population dynamics of the water vole was studied by trapping and tagging in 2003-2018, eagle owl pellets were collected for analyses, eagle owl breeding attempts were recorded, and some weather variables collected from official recordings. After having been introduced well into the study period, the number of sheep Ovis aries was also recorded. Water voles were the main prey of the eagle owl, with 89% occurrence in pellets, with an overrepresentation of adults and males. Both predation, sheep grazing and extreme weather events influenced the vole population. Predator exclusion, as happened in three summers due to an intensive radio tracking study, especially increased the number of surviving young (in particular from the early cohorts) and the mass of adults. Extreme weather events, such as flooding in summer and deeply frozen ground in winter, most significantly reduced vole populations. Sheep grazing may exacerbate the effects of predation. A similar multitude of factors may affect populations of other rodent species as well.

AB  - Globally, migratory ungulates are affected by fences. While field observational studies reveal the amount of animal-fence interactions across taxa, GPS tracking-based studies uncover fence effects on movement patterns and habitat selection. However, studies on the direct effects of fences and fence gaps on movement behavior, especially based on high-frequency tracking data, are scarce. We used GPS tracking on three common African antelopes (Tragelaphus strepsiceros, Antidorcas marsupialis, and T. oryx) with movement strategies ranging from range residency to nomadism in a semi-arid, Namibian savanna traversed by wildlife-proof fences that elephants have regularly breached. We classified major forms of ungulate-fence interaction types on a seasonal and a daily scale. Furthermore, we recorded the distances and times spent at fences regarding the total individual space use. Based on this, we analyzed the direct effects of fences and fence gaps on the animals' movement behavior for the previously defined types of animal-fence interactions. Antelope-fence interactions peaked during the early hours of the day and during seasonal transitions when the limiting resource changed between water and forage. Major types of ungulate-fence interactions were quick, trace-like, or marked by halts. We found that the amount of time spent at fences was highest for nomadic eland. Migratory springbok adjusted their space use concerning fence gap positions. If the small home ranges of sedentary kudu included a fence, they frequently interacted with this fence. For springbok and eland, distance traveled along a fence declined with increasing utilization of a fence gap. All species reduced their speed in the proximity of a fence but often increased their speed when encountering the fence. Crossing a fence led to increased speeds for all species. We demonstrate that fence effects mainly occur during crucial foraging times (seasonal scale) and during times of directed movements (daily scale). Importantly, we provide evidence that fences directly alter antelope movement behaviors with negative implications for energy budgets and that persistent fence gaps can reduce the intensity of such alterations. Our findings help to guide future animal-fence studies and provide insights for wildlife fencing and fence gap planning.

AB  - The urgency of restoring ecosystems over vast areas has placed rewilding using wild herbivores at the forefront. However, few scientific studies address its effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning compared to more traditional conservation interventions with domestic herbivores. Equus ferus przewalskii horses introduced 30 years ago in the National Park of Ce<acute accent>vennes, France - as a step of a conservation program of the species for its reintroduction in Mongolia - now occur as a semi-wild horse population, socially natural (i.e., management is based on natural selection). This introduction allowed us to compare this management system ('as wild') with other breeding systems: domestic sheep or domestic horses. Rewilding projects especially focus on the restoration of ecological functions, we therefore sought to find out if there are differences in the functional traits of the vegetation depending on the grazer and its management (domestic vs 'as wild') with the aim to generalize our results to other rewilding projects. Two levels of organization were tested (1) plant communities - using the TRY database and botanical surveys and (2) plant populations - by selecting four indicator species with traits measured in situ. Our results show that at equivalent grazing pressure, domestic horses or 'as wild' horses preserve the same plant functional types as in the traditional reference ecosystem grazed by sheep. Whatever the grazer and its management, grassland plant communities are characterized and dominated by perennial polycarpic plants, with oligotrophic to mesotrophic nutrient requirement, hemicryptophytes, graminoids, plants with entire leaf blades, not spiny, erect and mainly forming tussock. Nevertheless, some interesting significant differences were measured between the plant communities growing under the three types of grazing (e.g., lower functional richness and more plants with entire leaf blade under sheep grazing). Even between horse sub-species, differences were significant for some traits (e.g., more chamaephyte species growing under 'as wild' horses), which could be linked to physiological and morphological differences between the two horses sub-species (e.g., nutritional requirements, herbivore size) and by herd management. However, the intraspecific variability on the four quantitative traits measured on four indicator species do not show a general pattern. Although these results are valid at a given time and in a particular ecosystem, the vegetation functional traits approach can help in decision-making regarding ecosystem management choices and highlight the fact that the 'as wild' management adds an interesting alternative to conservation.

AB  - Despite the growing population of European bison (Bison bonasus), it is necessary to plan the reintroduction of these animals to new areas. Reintroduction of European bison often requires the improvement of natural conditions. Such preparatory activities allow European bison to more easily adapt to new places, but also impact the functioning of animals from other taxa. The aim of the presented study was to examine the impact of waterholes for European bison on the development of local populations of amphibians and dragonflies (Odonata), as well as the creation of new feeding grounds for bats. We examined 15 reservoirs in the Augustow Forest District located in northeastern Poland, of which five were waterholes for European bison built in 2013-2014, four were semi-natural reservoirs transformed into waterholes for European bison in 2018, and six were natural reservoirs. Dragonflies were studied in 2021-2022; amphibians in 2018 and 2020; and bats in 2018, 2019, and 2020. In total, 24 species of dragonflies (Odonata), 10 species of amphibians, and 13 species of bats were found. The results of the inventory of three taxonomic groups using different comparative variants indicate a significant impact of the construction of waterholes for European bison on the biodiversity of the forest ecosystem. We concluded that the waterholes for European bison present better resistance to drying out than natural reservoirs. In addition, waterholes warm up more quickly, supporting better conditions for amphibians. The surface of the reservoirs and their exposed surroundings are favorable for insects (including dragonflies), and these are a source of food for bats, becoming attractive feeding grounds for them.

AB  - Our understanding of the role of fire and effect of ant species composition, beyond their diversity and abundance, on the effectiveness of mutualism defence is limited. Most of our knowledge of ant-plant defence in tropical Africa is biased towards East African savannas which have richer soil, higher primary productivity and a more diverse arthropods and mammal community than West African savannas. We assessed the diversity of ant species associated with Acacia species in the Pendjari Biosphere Reserve in the Dahomey Gap, and their impacts on elephant damage. Elephant damage, ant diversity and abundance were measured in stands of five Acacia species. Eleven ant species were identified in the Acacia stands. The composition of these ant communities varied across Acacia species. Pair of ant species co-occurred in only 2 % of sampled trees, suggesting a strong competitive exclusion. Within this annually burnt environment, ants were rare on small trees. The intensity of elephant-caused branch breaking did not vary between trees with ants and trees without ants, suggesting limited Acacia-ant mutualism. Such limited biotic defence may mask strong physical and chemical defence mechanisms of Acacia trees against elephant damage. Ant assemblages in West Africa, unlike those in the more productive East Africa, are particularly species-poor. However, there is a convergence between these two regions in low rate of ant co-occurrence which might indicate strong competitive exclusion. Our study suggests that such low ant species richness while limiting the efficacy of mutualism in controlling mega-herbivore damage may mask a strong defence syndrome.

AB  - In 2021, a large transect with 281 10 x 10 m grid cells was re-surveyed in a limestone European beech forest (Hordelymo-Fagetum lathyretosum) on the plateau of the Gottingen Forest after surveys in 1981, 1991, 2001, and 2011. The stand, which has not been managed by forestry since the beginning of the permanent plot study, initially showed an increasing cover of the tree layer and, as a consequence of game-proof fencing until 2005, also an increasing cover of the shrub layer. Since 2011, the tree layer cover has decreased due to small openings after drought years and winter storms. Also, the shrub layer cover declined significantly since 2011, mainly due to ash dieback and the growing impact of deer browsing. In both vegetation layers, Fagus sylvatica was able to expand its dominant role. In the herbaceous layer, the sharp decline and loss of numerous species is striking, among them typical forest species that have been classified as characteristic for species-rich European beech forests on limestone (e. g., Lathyrus vernus, Mercurialis perennis). The large number of losers (27 species) is matched by only a small number of winners (5 species) between 1981 and 2021. Especially Allium ursinum and Hedera helix, but also the two Orchidaceae Epipactis helleborine and Neottia nidus-avis have increased significantly since 1981. The increase of the highly competitive Allium ursinum, probably due to an earlier start and a longer lasting vegetation period, is accompanied by an increasing share of beech in the tree layer. At the same time, the species diversity decreased, and the herb layer composition became more homogeneous across the transect. Hedera helix seems to have benefited mainly from climate change (lack of severe winter frosts, CO2 increase), but also from the temporary exclusion of roe deer browsing. Based on the analysis of mean indicator values shade-tolerant, oceanic-distributed species, as well as nitrogen and moisture indicators have increased, while more light demanding species continuously decreased between survey years. Compared to intensively managed stands with massive thinning and/or soil disturbances, as in coppice-with-standards or large shelterwood systems, these species suffered from a closed canopy after management abandonment. The small-scale disturbances caused by drought and windthrow in the period 2012-2021 are obviously not sufficient to provide favourable conditions for these species, including a large number of species that have been classified as typical for European beech forests on limestone and that have been present in the beginning of the long-term study. Thus, the presented time series indicates that eutrophic beech forests without forest management are species poorer than previously reported.

AB  - ContextLandscape fragmentation carries the risk of habitat loss for many animal species. This may include wild boars, which are one of the main culprits of conflicts with humans, while isolated patches of forest (forest islands) scattered in the agricultural landscape may affect its ecology and the pressure on the crops.ObjectivesThis study aimed to understand the importance of small forest islands located in a human-dominated agricultural landscape in the ecology of wild boar. It explores what features, both of the interior and exterior of the islands, influence their use.MethodsThe study area covered approximately 220,000 ha of northern Poland, where wild boar use of 200 islands distributed across the agricultural landscape was investigated. For this purpose, the method of counting pellet groups was applied on transects of a total length of 51.6 km. In order to compare the use of islands with compact forest complexes, 84 km of transects were made in the latter, divided into developmental stages and forest type.ResultsAmong the features of the interior of the islands, increasing cover conditions and the main species of trees (pine, spruce and alder) had a positive influence on the wild boar use. The utilization also depended on the presence of human settlements, other islands, and the type of agricultural crop around the island. When comparing island use to compact forest complexes, islands were used more often than forest regeneration sites and mature stands, but less often than pre-thickets. For the 25% most frequently used by wild boar, islands were more attractive than virtually all stand development stages in compact forest complexes.ConclusionsDue to the cover conditions provided, the occurrence of islands in the agricultural space enables wild boars to use areas more distant from compact forest complexes. This may cause the spread of damage caused by wild boars in the fields, but on the other hand it may reduce the pressure on agricultural areas in the immediate vicinity of compact forest complexes. Intensification of hunting pressure in the vicinity of islands with specific characteristics e.g. good cover conditions, considerable distance from human settlements) will increase the effectiveness of wild boar population control in the agricultural landscape and will have a limiting effect on the damage caused by this species in the fields.

AB  - Global coral reef ecosystems face various levels of disturbance pressure. Understanding the depth-structured variation in coral reef fish communities can help us to better grasp and predict the adaptive changes of the ecosystem under different stressors. This study applied eDNA metabarcoding technology to analyze the spatial distribution of the coral reef fish at various depths (0 m, 5 m, 10 m, 15 m, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m, 50 m, and 60 m) within the Xisha Islands of China. The results indicated that the eDNA technology detected a total of 213 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), including 33 species that were not identified using traditional methods. Herbivorous fish generally dominated in relative abundance across different depths. Moreover, the similarity among depth groups was largely absent, and significant differences existed in fish assemblages across depth gradients, consistent with the unique depth preferences of fish microhabitats. Importantly, our findings revealed distinct depth-structured variation among different functional groups of coral reef fish. Large carnivorous fish initially increased and then decreased along the depth gradient from 0 to 60 m, with a turning point around 20 m, while large herbivorous fish displayed the opposite trend. Small carnivorous and small herbivorous fish consistently declined along the same depth gradient. Additionally, the Margalef index (D) and Function richness (FRic) both displayed a consistent downward trend with increasing depth, while the Shannon-Wiener index (H '), Pielou index (J '), Quadratic entropy (RaoQ), Functional dispersion (FDis), and Functional evenness (FEve) initially increased and then decreased, peaking around 20 m. This study revealed that eDNA metabarcoding is an effective tool for evaluating coral reef fish biodiversity, community composition, and spatial distribution. It enhances our understanding of distribution dynamics and offers valuable insights for coral reef conservation and restoration efforts.

AB  - Tree architectures reflect the main abiotic and biotic selection pressures determining tree growth and survival. Studies have shown that trees growing in herbivore-dominated ecosystems, such as savannas, develop denser, more divaricate 'cage'-like architectures in response to chronic browsing pressure (also known as 'brown world' architectures). In contrast, trees growing under resource-limited conditions develop traits that allow them to better compete for abiotic resources (referred to as 'green world' architectures); for example, light limitation can induce trees to form more pole-like structures that allow them to grow faster in height. In temperate forests, abiotic drivers have traditionally been assumed to be the main factors affecting plant architecture. However, gap dynamics typically characterize old-growth temperate forests, where disturbances such as storms create gaps with temporary high-light availability, but also attracting intense mammalian browsing. Under such conditions, one would expect tree saplings to exhibit high architectural plasticity enabling them to develop a 'cage' in response to high herbivore pressure, but when herbivore pressure declines switch to a more pole-like structure that allows them to grow quickly in height and compete for light. We tested the ability of five dominant European tree species to induce a 'cage' architecture (hereafter referred to as 'cage plasticity') under contrasting light and herbivory regimes in a full-factorial experiment in Bialowieza Forest. We planted 720 young tree saplings in six replicated blocks in which we manipulated ungulate browsing (exclosure vs. control) and light levels (gap vs. closed forest). Two out of the five species (hornbeam Carpinus betulus and lime Tilia cordata) were able to develop a cage when exposed to ungulate herbivores but only under high-light conditions. These two species had the highest survival rates in the herbivory treatment over a 10-year period. Synthesis. Cage plasticity in temperate forest tree species may reflect an overlooked adaptation to mammal herbivory originating in a past when large mammals exerted strong selection pressures in European ecosystems. Our findings challenge the view of closed-canopy forest communities being solely driven by abiotic drivers and call for a re-evaluation of the importance of large herbivores in shaping the functional traits of temperate tree species.

AB  - Human-induced species declines and extinctions have led to the downsizing of large-herbivore assemblages, with implications for many ecosystem processes. Active reintroduction of extirpated large herbivores or their functional equivalents may help to reverse this trend and restore diverse ecosystems and their processes. However, it is unclear whether resource competition between native and non-native herbivores could threaten restoration initiatives, or to what extent (re)introduced species may influence local vegetation dynamics. To answer these questions, we investigated the diets of a novel South American herbivore assemblage that includes resident native species, reintroduced native species and introduced non-native species. We examined plant composition, diet breadth and the overlap between species to describe the local herbivory profile and the potential for resource competition. Using DNA metabarcoding on faecal samples (n = 465), we analysed the diets of the herbivore assemblage in the Rincon del Socorro rewilding area of Ibera National Park, Argentina. We compared the species richness of faecal samples, the occurrence of plant families/growth forms and the compositional similarity of samples (inter- and intraspecifically). Our results indicate species-level taxonomic partitioning of plant resources by herbivores in this system. Differences in sample richness, composition and diet breadth reflected a diverse range of herbivory strategies, from grazers (capybara) to mixed feeders/browsers (brocket deer, lowland tapir). Differences in diet compositional similarity (Jaccard) revealed strong taxonomic resource partitioning. The two herbivores with the most similar diets (Pampas deer and brocket deer) still differed by more than 80%. Furthermore, all but one species (axis deer) had more similar diet composition intraspecifically than compared to the others. Overall, we found little evidence for resource competition between herbivore species. Instead, recently reintroduced native species and historically introduced non-natives are likely expanding the range of herbivory dynamics in the ecosystem. Further research will be needed to determine the full ecological impacts of these (re)introduced herbivores. In conclusion, we show clear differences in diet breadth and composition among native, reintroduced and non-native herbivore species that may be key to promoting resource partitioning, species coexistence and the restoration of ecological function.
   La disminucion y extincion de especies ocasionada por el hombre ha llevado a la reduccion de tamano de las comunidades de grandes herbivoros, con implicaciones para muchos procesos ecosistemicos. La reintroduccion activa de grandes herbivoros extirpados, o sus equivalentes funcionales, puede ayudar a revertir esta tendencia y restaurar diversos ecosistemas y sus procesos. Sin embargo, no esta claro si la competencia por recursos entre herbivoros nativos y no nativos podria amenazar las iniciativas de restauracion, o en que medida las especies (re)introducidas pueden influir la dinamica de la vegetacion local. Para responder a estas preguntas, investigamos las dietas de una comunidad de herbivoros sudamericanos que incluye especies nativas, especies nativas reintroducidas y especies no nativas introducidas. Examinamos la composicion de plantas, la amplitud de la dieta y la superposicion entre especies para describir el perfil herbivoro local y el potencial de competencia por los recursos. Utilizando metabarcoding de ADN en muestras fecales (n = 465), analizamos las dietas de la comunidad de herbivoros en el sitio de rewilding Rincon del Socorro dentro del Parque Nacional Ibera, Argentina. Comparamos la riqueza de especies en las muestras fecales, la ocurrencia de familias de plantas/formas de crecimiento y la similitud en la composicion de las muestras (interespecificamente e intraespecificamente). Nuestros resultados indican la particion taxonomica a nivel de especie de los recursos vegetales por parte de los herbivoros en este sistema. Las diferencias en la riqueza de las muestras, la composicion y la amplitud de las dietas reflejaron una amplia gama de estrategias de herbivoria, desde pastoreadores (capibara) hasta herbivoros mixtos/ramoneadores (corzuela, tapir amazonico). Las diferencias en la similitud de la composicion de la dieta (Jaccard) revelaron una fuerte particion taxonomica de los recursos. Los dos herbivoros con las dietas mas similares (venado de las pampas y corzuela), aun asi diferian en mas del 80%. Ademas, todas las especies menos una (ciervo axis) tenian una composicion dietetica mas similar intraespecificamente que en comparacion con las demas. En general, encontramos poca evidencia de competencia por recursos entre las especies de herbivoros. En cambio, las especies nativas reintroducidas recientemente y las no nativas introducidas historicamente probablemente esten ampliando el rango de dinamica de herbivoria en el ecosistema. Se necesitaran mas investigaciones para determinar todos los impactos ecologicos de estos herbivoros (re)introducidos. En conclusion, mostramos diferencias claras en la amplitud y composicion de la dieta entre especies de herbivoros nativas, reintroducidas y no nativas que pueden ser clave para promover la particion de recursos, la coexistencia de especies y la restauracion de las funciones ecologicas.
   DNA metabarcoding was used to reveal differences in herbivory strategy among large herbivores at an Argentinian rewilding site. Based on diet composition, we find little evidence for resource competition between species. Instead, recently reintroduced native species and historically introduced non-natives are likely expanding the range of herbivory dynamics in the ecosystem.image

AB  - Introduced fauna threaten Australia's native species via herbivory, predation, and competition. After fire, these effects can be amplified.
   Post-fire impacts from introduced animals can cause mortality in the months following fire to exceed mortality caused during the fire. The impacts of introduced animals can persist years after the fire event - for example, if fires allow expansion of introduced species into new areas.
   Introduced herbivores influence the greatest range of native species post-fire, affecting plants (consumption, trampling), terrestrial animals (competition, removal of cover), and aquatic animals (trampling riparian vegetation, fouling streams).
   Some introduced species are a particular threat for specific taxa. For example, introduced terrestrial predators threaten many mammals, and introduced fish threaten native fish.
   Control programs for introduced species began quickly after the 2019-20 wildfires, and at increased scales. The open post-fire canopy improved visibility over extensive areas, briefly allowing aerial shooting and baiting to occur in places where such techniques are not usually feasible. The wildfires also reduced populations of introduced species, providing opportunities to achieve suppression.
   Extensive, severe fires provide opportunities to expand introduced species control, such as preventing the reinvasion of introduced fish into streams where they have been extirpated by fire-related sediment pulses; or by delaying apiary activities in forests recovering from fire, so that native species recolonise tree hollows before feral bees.
   Predicting the outcomes of interactions between introduced species and wildfire is crucial for shaping effective and efficient management in future fires, but such predictions will remain challenging until long-term monitoring programs are established that track how populations of introduced and native species respond to wildfires, and if/how management of introduced species supports recovery.

AB  - Geese are known to impact on the species composition and abundance of plant communities, with grazing pressure by flocks negatively affecting various aspects of vegetation and ecosystems. However, positive effects have also been highlighted, including grazing preventing competition among plants and helping to maintain a high level of biodiversity. The Middendorf's bean goose Anser fabalis middendorffii is one waterfowl that winters in the marsh lands of Japan. At the Katano-kamoike pond, the species main wintering site in central Japan, the effects of goose grazing on the structure of marsh plant communities were investigated by using field observations and experiments. During observations of foraging behavior, A. fabalis middendorffii mainly foraged on underground parts of Zizania latifolia and Bolboschoenus fluviatilis, including rhizomes, roots, and tubers, at the marshlands of the pond. The field census showed the biomass of the underground parts was significantly reduced by A. fabalis middendorffii grazing during winter. Specifically, the biomass of rhizomes in Z. latifolia was drastically decreased. Data collected from exclosure experiments over 5 years suggested that grazing pressure regulated the overgrowth of B. fluviatilis and enhanced the abundance of Z. latifolia. Furthermore, a field census of marsh plants at the Shimofukuda reservoir, where there have been no A. fabalis middendorffii, confirmed that the absence of A. fabalis middendorffii was related to a decrease in the abundance and biodiversity of marsh plants. In the Katano-kamoike pond, A. fabalis middendorffii may play a key role in maintaining plant diversity.

AB  - Invasive grasses cause devastating losses to biodiversity and ecosystem function directly and indirectly by altering ecosystem processes. Escape from natural enemies, plant-plant competition, and variable resource availability provide frameworks for understanding invasion. However, we lack a clear understanding of how natural stressors interact in their native range to regulate invasiveness. In this study, we reduced diverse guilds of natural enemies and plant competitors of the highly invasive buffelgrass across a precipitation gradient throughout major climatic shifts in Laikipia, Kenya. To do this, we used a long-term ungulate exclosure experiment design across a precipitation gradient with nested treatments that (1) reduced plant competition through clipping, (2) reduced insects through systemic insecticide, and (3) reduced fungal associates through fungicide application. Additionally, we measured the interaction of ungulates on two stem-boring insect species feeding on buffelgrass. Finally, we measured a multiyear smut fungus outbreak. Our findings suggest that buffelgrass exhibits invasive qualities when released from a diverse group of natural stressors in its native range. We show natural enemies interact with precipitation to alter buffelgrass productivity patterns. In addition, interspecific plant competition decreased the basal area of buffelgrass, suggesting that biotic resistance mediates buffelgrass dominance in the home range. Surprisingly, systemic insecticides and fungicides did not impact buffelgrass production or reproduction, perhaps because other guilds filled the niche space in these highly diverse systems. For example, in the absence of ungulates, we showed an increase in host-specific stem-galling insects, where these insects compensated for reduced ungulate use. Finally, we documented a smut outbreak in 2020 and 2021, corresponding to highly variable precipitation patterns caused by a shifting Indian Ocean Dipole. In conclusion, we observed how reducing natural enemies and competitors and certain interactions increased properties related to buffelgrass invasiveness.

AB  - Grassland plant community structure and function are dependent on the type, timing, frequency and intensity of disturbance. Grazing systems employing dense herds of livestock for short periods of time (e.g. Adaptive Multi-paddock Grazing; AMP) are gaining popularity as a potentially sustainable practice. Effects of AMP systems on plant diversity and composition are unknown, though theory provides some expectations. Spatially homogeneous grazing used by AMP may be a uniform ecological filter, thereby lowering plant diversity; alternatively, the AMP practice of using multiple paddocks might enhance habitat heterogeneity. Maintaining plant diversity, particularly of native species, is a key aspect of sustainability. As such, an understanding of the real-world effects of AMP grazing is needed. We studied grasslands within 18 pairs of ranches across the northern Great Plains. Ranches managed under AMP were paired with a neighbouring ranch (N-AMP) using regionally representative grazing practices. We collected surveys of management practices and conducted 2 years of on-farm sampling to identify plant composition and diversity. Ranch management practices used by self-identified AMP ranchers differed significantly (p < 0.1) from those used on neighbouring ranches, with higher stocking densities (number of animals per area at a single time) but not stocking rates (total number of animals per unit time per area) on AMP relative to N-AMP ranches. There were fewer plant species in AMP grasslands at both the plot and landscape scales compared to N-AMP ranches despite no overall difference in plant community composition. Management type did not alter the variability of plant community composition (beta diversity) or plot-level species evenness. Although there were trends for lower diversity of native and introduced species at both spatial scales, a significant effect was found only for native species at the landscape scale. Synthesis and applications. The impacts of AMP grazing system management were limited to a minor reduction in plant diversity, with a modest decline in native species richness. We conclude that the benefits of AMP grazing in the northern Great Plains do not include the maintenance of plant diversity, and this system could hinder the conservation of remaining native plant species.

AB  - Populations of wild boar and feral pigs (Sus scrofa) are increasing in numbers and distribution worldwide, in parallel with their significant environmental and economic impact. Reliable methods to detect the presence of this species are needed for monitoring its natural range expansion and its occurrence in areas where animals have been deliberately or accidentally introduced. The main aim of this study, carried out in English woodlands recently colonized by wild boar, was to assess the effectiveness of a birch wood tar-based compound, to detect the presence of this species in presence/absence surveys. A pilot trial in woodlands where wild boar had been established for circa 20 years found that wild boar sniffed and rubbed their bodies against stakes treated with this compound significantly more than against control stakes treated with water, thus confirming that the birch wood tar attracted wild boar to stakes. A second trial, carried out by applying the birch wood tar to trees in 8 woodlands surrounding the core range of wild boar, found that these animals left consistently more activity signs such as rubbing, tusk marks, and rooting on or around trees treated with this compound than on or around control trees treated with water. These results suggest that birch wood tar can be used as a method to confirm presence of wild boar in an area. Possible applications of this compound include its use to increase trapping efficiency or its deployment to confirm the success of a local eradication.

AB  - Australia is dominated by 6 million km(2) of rangelands that contribute significantly to the livestock industry and carbon (C) market; yet, few studies have quantified the influence of grazing management on woody biomass and C stocks across these rangelands. Here, we quantified stand-level C stocks (Mg C ha(-1)) in live aboveground biomass (AGB), live belowground biomass (BGB), standing dead mass, coarse woody debris (CWD) and litter of rangeland vegetation at 46 long-term (average 40 year) grazing trials comprising grazed control plots paired with exclosures protected from grazers. Four major woody vegetation types were considered, namely, those dominated by Eucalyptus species, Acacia aneura, other Acacia species, and other species. Most C stocks (except litter C) were highest in Eucalyptus-dominated vegetation and lowest in the 'other species' types. There was high variability and few significant grazing effects on C stocks. There was a trend of higher AGB-C, BGB-C, woody basal area (m(2) ha(-1)) and litter C with grazing exclusion at sites with mean annual precipitation of >300 mm, but the magnitude of increase was highly variable. The impact of the type of grazer was highly variable, although there was a trend of higher woody biomass C where rabbits and domestic livestock were excluded than with exclusion of domestic livestock only. The relative effects of grazing declined as the woody basal area of grazed control plots increased. Our results showed that although grazing exclusion can facilitate C stock accumulation in woody vegetation, it is difficult to predict when and where this may occur. To enable greater clarity, future studies may need to collect additional information, including data on soil water availability and current and historical grazing intensity.

AB  - AimsLand use modifies natural forest herbivore assemblages by cattle introduction and structural alteration that impact invertebrate diversity. This land use and herbivory combined effect is particularly relevant for woody plant juveniles, which are key stages for regeneration. We aimed to understand how herbivory on juvenile woody plants is affected by land use. In this study, we analyzed how vertebrate and invertebrate herbivory patterns on seedlings and saplings change between land uses in winter and summer seasons.LocationSouthernmost Gran Chaco region, C & oacute;rdoba province, central Argentina.MethodologyWe assessed the invertebrate and vertebrate herbivory on seedlings and saplings of woody species during summer and winter seasons at four different land use types of a Chaco dry forest. Land use types were classified according to the increasing intensity of disturbance (logging and grazing) they are subjected to: Conserved Forest (CF; no disturbance), Secondary Forest (SF; low disturbance), Closed Species-rich Shrubland (CS; intermediate disturbance), and Open Shrubland (OS; high disturbance).ResultsWe found that total herbivory was consistently higher in SF and CS in both seasons. Vertebrate herbivory was higher than invertebrate herbivory in winter (except in CF), with the inverse pattern in summer. Differences between seedling and sapling stages were scarce, with not consistent patterns of herbivory between seasons.ConclusionsThis study shows a pronounced effect of land use on seasonal herbivory patterns and dynamics. The vegetation structure of communities under low and intermediate disturbance intensities would promote diversity of invertebrate herbivores, which, combined with cattle introduction, could result in herbivory complementation and additivity. Understanding how environmental filters, like anthropic activities and herbivory, interplay and affect early growth stages is crucial to achieving land use practices that do not compromise forest resilience and regeneration.

AB  - The Eastern European Alps boasts highly biodiverse ecosystems and a rich archaeological history. However, there is limited research on the enduring impacts of historical climate change and human activities on plant biodiversity in this region. Using sedimentary ancient DNA, we reconstructed plant and animal dynamics from 8500 years before present (ka BP) around Gro beta er Winterleitensee (Zirbitzkogel, Austria). Variable intensities of human activities since the Middle Bronze Age (similar to 3.5 ka BP) facilitated the persistence of biodiverse Alpine meadow communities and lowered timberlines below their natural limit. Since the end of the Bronze Age (similar to 2.8 ka BP), human activities, particularly pasturing, and increasing temperatures, emerged as significant drivers of plant community dynamics. The introduction of sheep (Ovis aries) did not reduce wild mammal presence, including red deer (Cervus elaphus), hare (Lepus), European mole (Talpa europaea), bank vole (Myodes glareolus), and short-tailed field vole (Microtus agrestis). During the High & Late Mediaeval Period, (similar to 1150-450 BP), cattle (Bos taurus) and horses (Equus caballus) became the dominant domesticates, while all wild mammals except the short-tailed field vole and Eurasian water shrew (Neomys fodiens) declined or even disappeared. These changes are also accompanied by a significant transformation of plant community structure. The ability to determine both plant responses and animal drivers from the same palaeolimnological sequence vastly improves our ability to partition causes of vegetation change over the Holocene. Here, we reveal that plant biodiversity is maintained or increased by moderate cattle grazing. Therefore, non-intensive domesticated stock grazing is essential for maintaining diverse Alpine meadows.

AB  - Protected natural forests are critical for biodiversity conservation, but they are threatened by pervasive drivers of change that may not be mitigated by legal protection. Selective herbivory by non-native or hyper-abundant browsing mammals can affect forest composition and structure by suppressing palatable species and facilitating avoided species. Impacts can be severe, especially on islands, like Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ), which historically lacked herbivorous mammals. We used a national network of permanent plots with a 12-year record of stem census data to determine how species-level dietary preference and site-level abundance of non-native herbivorous mammals (possums and ungulates) were associated with mortality rates and recruitment rates into a 2.5 cm diameter class among common tree species in forests with different levels of legal protection. National parks (NPs) had higher legal protection and lower herbivorous mammal indices than non-national parks (NNPs) but across both there were 1702 live stems of species palatable to possums and ungulates recorded when plots were first measured but 1502 in the latest measurements. Mortality of these species exceeded their recruitment in both NPs and NNPs. The total tree population was stable, but while most species palatable to ungulates and possums were in decline, some species avoided by the herbivores had growing populations, with recruitment rates exceeding mortality. At current levels of abundance, non-native herbivorous mammals are driving significant compositional shifts in tree populations of both NPs and NNPs. Long-term (decadal) suppression of their abundance is needed to preserve the ecological integrity of NZ's protected forests.

AB  - Invasive axis deer (Axis axis) currently thrive along the Parana and Uruguay River watersheds in Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. There is little information on axis deer ecology in its introduced range. We assessed seasonal and spatial variation in selected dietary items of axis deer, and tested whether the consumption of invasive woody plants and bait deployed for hunting purposes was related to their spatial availability at El Palmar National Park, home to the threatened Butia yatay palm tree. We identified macroscopically the rumen contents of 197 deer culled by controlled shooting over bait in winter and summer and by spotlighting from slow-moving vehicles in winter. Rumen contents by volume mostly contained grass and leaves in winter (95.3%) and summer (69.9%), followed by fruits/seeds of palm trees (in summer only) and invasive woody plants (mostly in winter), including honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), chinaberry (Melia azedarach), Chinese (Ligustrum sinense) and glossy privet (Ligustrum lucidum), and firethorn (Pyracantha atalantoides). Permutational analysis of variance confirmed that axis deer dietary composition varied significantly between seasons and hunting methods. The proportion of bait-fed deer culled by controlled shooting increased significantly with an increasing amount of bait (soybean or dry maize) deployed at each blind. The consumption of each invasive woody species was spatially aggregated and matched their core area of occupancy, suggesting localized feeding and limited short-term movement consistent with deer philopatric behavior. By providing the deer with cover, water and nutrient-dense food items, the riverine forest gains special relevance for integrated management efforts targeting both exotic woody species and exotic ungulates.

AB  - Aim: Several large-mammal species in Europe have recovered and recolonized parts of their historical ranges. Knowing where suitable habitat exists, and thus where range expansions are possible, is important for proactively promoting coexistence between people and large mammals in shared landscapes. We aimed to assess the opportunities and limitations for range expansions of Europe's two largest herbivores, the European bison (Bison bonasus) and moose (Alces alces).Location: Central Europe.Methods: We used large occurrence datasets from multiple populations and species distribution models to map environmentally suitable habitats for European bison and moose across Central Europe, and to assess human pressure inside the potential habitat. We then used circuit theory modeling to identify potential recolonization corridors.Results: We found widespread suitable habitats for both European bison (> 120,000 km(2)) and moose (> 244,000 km(2)), suggesting substantial potential for range expansions. However, much habitat was associated with high human pressure (37% and 43% for European bison and moose, respectively), particularly in the west of Central Europe. We identified a strong east-west gradient of decreasing connectivity, with major barriers likely limiting natural recolonization in many areas.Main conclusions: We identify major potential for restoring large herbivores and their functional roles in Europe's landscapes. However, we also highlight considerable challenges for conservation planning and wildlife management, including areas where recolonization likely leads to human-wildlife conflict and where barriers to movement prevent natural range expansion. Conservation measures restoring broad-scale connectivity are needed in order to allow European bison and moose to recolonize their historical ranges. Finally, our analyses and maps indicate suitable but isolated habitat patches that are unlikely to be colonized but are candidate locations for reintroductions to establish reservoir populations. More generally, our work emphasizes that transboundary cooperation is needed for restoring large herbivores and their ecological roles, and to foster coexistence with people in Europe's landscapes.

AB  - Mountain environments pose challenges for accurately assessing the population size of ungulates, which may hamper confidence in using abundance estimates for decision-making. Thus, evaluations of the accuracy of methods using known-size populations are valuable. Here, we tested the accuracy of direct counts and distance sampling to assess the size of a fenced population of Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) of known size. We evaluated the influence of observer expertise (beginners and experts) on the detection error of female and male ibexes and whether training improved accuracy. The ibex population comprised 18 individuals (ten males and eight females) living in a 17-ha enclosure in northeastern Spain. After 27 surveys, experts detected 16% more ibexes than beginners. Male ibexes were similar to 13% easier to detect than females, and experts were more accurate than beginners in sexing individuals. Additionally, the detection error in absolute counts was similar among beginners but different among experts (> 10%). Despite reducing detection error over subsequent surveys, under-detection was > 50% in all events (> 85% and > 67% for beginners and experts, respectively). Our data indicate a systematic underestimation of direct counts of our mountain ungulate populations and the contribution of expertise to improving accuracy. Our results show that managers assessing mountain ungulate populations for management purposes should consider alternative methods.

AB  - Bubalus mindorensis (tamaraw) and Sus oliveri (Mindoro warty pig) are emblematic of Mindoro Island as a faunal biodiversity hotspot in the Philippines. However, these endemic, red-listed mammals are of socioecological concern due to pressures within their contracting home ranges. Conservation efforts are logistically hindered by their elusive yet aggressive behavior and coexistence with indigenous tribes. This study aims to identify high conservation value areas (HCVAs), sites where both species are highly suitable. Ensemble species distribution modeling (SDM) based on nine algorithms was performed. For each species, three ensemble SDMs were calibrated following three proposed approaches in decreasing hyperparameter-based model complexity: standard, tuned, and limited. Across ensemble SDMs, complexity and True Skill Statistics (TSS)-based accuracy are positively associated. Still, the limited ensemble SDM of tamaraw (TSS = 0.740) and Mindoro warty pig (TSS = 0.855) retain good discriminatory performance. These coincidingly predict that known occurrence sites are areas of high suitability, which are spatially fragmented into four patches across the Mindoro Mountain Range: Mt. Calavite Wildlife Sanctuary, Upper Amnay Watershed, Aruyan-Malati, and Mts. Iglit-Baco National Park. In total, these prospective HCVAs cover 405.17 km2 (3.83%) of Mindoro Island, which represent areas of priority for the ongoing Mindoro Island Biodiversity (BD) Corridor Project. This study substantiates the need for strategic management of these HCVAs. Despite overarching study-specific limitations and uncertainties, this study advocates the informed use of ensemble SDMs for reserve selection, conservation planning, and wildlife-related policymaking in Mindoro Island.

AB  - Calcareous grasslands are of high conservation importance and have been maintained by livestock grazing over many centuries. Following the reduction in traditional livestock grazing (cattle and sheep) of semi-natural grassland during the twentieth century, conservation-based grazing management was introduced in order to conserve remaining grasslands. In UK semi-natural grasslands, grazing pressure has fluctuated over time due to changes in conservation funding and stock availability, whilst the time of year at which stock graze has also shifted. There is little quantitative data available to demonstrate the details of changed grazing patterns, or their long-term effects on the vegetation, thus the full impacts of these changes are not well understood. This study examines the response of a diverse calcareous grassland community to changes in grazing management between 1979 and 2010 at Martin Down National Nature Reserve, southern England, using historical vegetation surveys and grazing records collected and recorded by reserve staff. Historical data showed a shift in grazing regime, whereby grazing occurred across all seasons in the early period, but switched to predominately the autumn and winter in the present century. Despite this significant shift in management over time, the vegetation community did not change dramatically over this period, although small increases in species richness and diversity were detected. The richness of calcareous grassland indicator species remained largely consistent, suggesting the conservation value of the grassland persisted, and the community types also stayed fairly constant over the 31 years. Furthermore, weak evidence was found for impacts of grazing in particular seasons on vegetation community measures; species richness, species diversity, indicator richness, indicator abundance, grass abundance and forb abundance. This study suggests that these vegetation communities are robust to changes in grazing seasonality providing that sufficient grazing pressure is provided within the year. The compartmentalised grazing employed at Martin Down may be a useful method for ensuring this outcome. However more research is required, preferably using controlled field experiments before more reliable recommendations can be prescribed.

AB  - Expanding native woodland, including by natural regeneration, helps address the biodiversity and climate crises. For small-seeded trees, like many pine species, disturbances such as fires can enhance seedling recruitment, boosting sapling establishment. We tested this idea on heathland beside semi-natural Scots pine Pinus sylvestris forest in Scotland, a heavily deforested country with abundant deer. A replicated experiment was established, comprising 10 blocks within 50 m of seed-trees, each with four 10 x 10 m plots. In each block, two treatment factors, prescribed burning and deer exclusion (by fencing) were applied in all combinations. Seedling establishment to year 5 was reported previously, showing a similar to tenfold increase in burnt plots. Here, we report on establishment to year 16, when many young trees were over 25 cm, defined here as saplings. Where deer had access, mean sapling density in burnt plots was 16.9 times higher (95% CLs 5.8-49) than unburnt. This factor was lower where deer were excluded by fencing, though still large (6.6; 2.9-16). Sapling cover and maximum height were also higher in burnt plots than unburnt ones, by factors of 2.3-6.7. There was a tendency for higher stem density in burnt plots where deer were present, but lower height and cover. However, fencing effects were modest, perhaps partly reflecting low deer numbers at our study site. Our results help quantify how disturbances can influence the establishment of trees with small, wind-blown seeds, and support the use of prescribed fire to enhance Scots pine regeneration in similar contexts.

AB  - Seed limitation can narrow down the number of coexisting plant species, limit plant community productivity, and also constrain community responses to changing environmental and biotic conditions. In a 10-year full-factorial experiment of seed addition, fertilisation, warming and herbivore exclusion, we tested how seed addition alters community richness and biomass, and how its effects depend on seed origin and biotic and abiotic context. We found that seed addition increased species richness in all treatments, and increased plant community biomass depending on nutrient addition and warming. Novel species, originally absent from the communities, increased biomass the most, especially in fertilised plots and in the absence of herbivores, while adding seeds of local species did not affect biomass. Our results show that seed limitation constrains both community richness and biomass, and highlight the importance of considering trophic interactions and soil nutrients when assessing novel species immigrations and their effects on community biomass.

AB  - The influence of grazing on soil seed bank (SSB) characteristics determines the management of rangelands in different climates. Here we studied the responses of SSBs to livestock grazing in three regions with different climates - arid, semiarid and subhumid - in northern Iran. In each region 30 pairwise SSB samples were collected on 1 m2 plots, 15 in intensely grazed areas and 15 in ungrazed areas. The total SSB densities, their diversity and species richness and the densities of functional groups were compared between the grazed and ungrazed plots and between the climatic regions. Both climate and grazing as well as their interaction affected SSB characteristics. Although the results of the non-metric multidimensional scaling (NoS) showed noticeable differences in SSB species composition between grazed and ungrazed plots in all three regions, the magnitude of the grazing effect on the SSB was different between climatic regions. In total, 119 species germinated from the soil samples: 33 species in semiarid, 39 species in arid and 61 species in subhumid samples. The highest total SSB density, diversity (Shannon index) and richness were found in subhumid climate with an average of 138.90 seeds/m2, H = 2.27 and 17.83 species/sample, respectively. In ungrazed areas the average SSB density was 26.60 seeds/m2, 46.06 seeds/m2 and 195.90 seeds/m2 in arid, semiarid and subhumid climate, respectively. In grazed areas the corresponding figures were 12.40 seeds/m2, 7.00 seeds/m2 and 110.40 seeds/m2. Averages of SSB diversity in ungrazed areas were 1.24, 1.60 and 2.42 in arid, semiarid and subhumid climates, respectively, as compared to 1.27, 0.97 and 2.20 in grazed areas. The averages SSB richness in ungrazed areas were 5.21 species/sample, 7.54 species/sample and 21.25 species/sample in arid, semiarid and subhumid climate, respectively, whereas in grazed areas 4.00 species/sample, 2.86 species/sample and 16.15 species/sample were found on average. Overall, intensive grazing was linked to lower SSB characteristics in all three climatic regions, but the size of the effect differed between the climatic regions. Thus, we concluded that the impact of grazing on SSB density, diversity and richness is climate-dependent. Hence, the climatic conditions have to be considered when evaluating the effects of grazing on soil seed banks.

AB  - Simple Summary Insect pests and their natural enemies can harbor in riparian zones. To determine the impact of insect communities on agriculture and ecology, we must quantitatively assess insect populations in riparian areas. To identify the appropriate methodology for effective insect sampling in riparian areas, we assessed sweep sampling within three plant communities using different numbers of subsampling units (50 sweeps carried out twice, or 10 sweeps over 10 times) over two years. The results reveal that effective insect sampling varies between different plant communities and insect orders. The similarities between terrestrial insect communities in the same plant community were relatively high, even in different years. The optimum sampling size to obtain approximately 80% of the total species was estimated for each survey site. Our results lay the foundations for providing techniques to assess insect populations within riparian areas to predict and prevent herbivorous insect pest invasions in the future. To investigate insect and plant community relationships in riparian zones, terrestrial insect communities were compared in plant communities in the riparian zone of the Miho River, Korea. The sweep netting method was used to sample insects in 50 m transects in three herbaceous plant communities. In 2020, each plant community-Chenopodium album, Beckmannia syzigachne, and Artemisia indica-was swept 100 times (50 sweeps x 2). In 2021, two communities had an additional 100 sweeps collected using 10 subsamples of 10 sweeps (excluding C. album communities). The surveyed dominant species or subdominant species of the insect community in each site preyed on the dominant plant species at the site. The Bray-Curtis similarity was significantly higher than the Sorensen similarity when comparing datasets across different years for the same plant species community. The predicted optimum sampling size to obtain approximately 80% of the total species estimated to be at each survey site, for effective quantitative collection of terrestrial insect herbivores in each plant community, was examined. Fifty sweeps were required for the A. indica community and 100 sweeps were required for the B. syzigachne community. The results of this study provide important data for riparian biodiversity conservation and future pest monitoring.

AB  - Introduction Most Central European grasslands crucially depend on land use, and thus there is a need to comparatively analyse the impacts of different types of land use management on grassland biota. Aims and methods We use grasshoppers (Orthoptera), which are the most important insect herbivores in grasslands, and assess the differences of grazing (sheep) and mowing on species abundance, richness, and composition. We use a river embankment in the National Park Donau Auen as study site, where we have established 28 transects. Orthoptera abundance was surveyed 13 times between May and September 2019 in each transect. Results We recorded 24 Orthoptera species, of which 12 species are listed in the national Red List. The most abundant non-threatened species is Pseudochorthippus parallelus in mown transects, while in grazed transects Euchorthippus declivus is most abundant. Eight of the ten most abundant Orthoptera species differed significantly in abundance between mown and grazed transects. Total abundance of Orthoptera was higher in mown transects, while grazed transects had higher species richness. Most xero-thermophilic species were more abundant in grazed transects, while some species of mesic grassland were more abundant in mown transects. These species-level differences resulted in clearly separated Orthoptera species assemblages between grazed and mown transects. Our findings suggest that the less dense vegetation in grazed transects better fulfilled the habitat requirements of xero-thermophilic species compared to mown transects Discussion Given that mown and grazed transects are located adjacent to each other, that the complete study site was mown for many decades and grazing was only started one year before field data collection, the scale of differences in species richness, composition and abundances between grazed and mown transects is surprising. Thus, our findings indicate that grasshoppers respond rapidly to changing land use. Implications for insect conservation We conclude that river embankments can be important secondary habitats for species-rich grasshopper communities. We recommend that grazing should be continued at the river embankment, ideally as rotational pasture as currently done. Mowing should be changed towards mowing parts of the river embankment at different times and leaving small strips of vegetation unmown.

AB  - In landscapes with high elephant density, trees often exhibit more open canopies with fewer branches and foliage due to browsing pressure. This can result in altered tree morphology, with trees exhibiting stunted growth, multiple stems or unusual branching patterns in response to repeated damage from browsing. The objectives of this research were to (i) model the vegetation structure allometries, (ii) assess the impact of African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana) herbivory on the vegetation structure and (iii) assess tree cover change and vegetation performance over time in Mana Pools National Park in Zimbabwe. We established 26 plots of 30 x 30 m size. Selection of sampling plots was done following several steps. First, a fish net grid with 30 x 30 m polygons was created and projected on the polygon of Mana Pools National Park. The polygons for exclusion zones were then clipped from the fish net grid using the clip tool in ArcGIS Pro 3.0. Then, selection of sampling plots was done initially by stratified random sampling using the Sampling Design Tool add in for ArcGIS Pro 3.0. Landsat images for the years 2003, 2013 and 2023 were used to assess land use land cover (LULC) time series and to calculate Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) for the period. A generalised linear model (GLM) was used to analyse tree allometries. Further statistical investigations were performed using Bayesian piecewise regression (BPR) and Bayesian regression modelling (BRM). Basal area, number of stems, height, long canopy, diameter and basal circumference were all significantly different (p < 0.05) across all sampled plots. The change in growing conditions occurring as a tree grows beyond the reach of the African savannah elephant browsing indicates a natural system breakpoint. The best-fitting models were a simple linear model and a two breakpoint model for the plant population exposed to elephant herbivory. LULC, NDVI and SAVI confirm evidence of high tree regeneration over 2 decades. Understanding the dynamics in vegetation and LULC changes is critical for effective conservation and management of the habitats for African savannah elephants, as well as for maintaining the health and resilience of forest ecosystems.

AB  - An evolutionary significant unit of the Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica), the Pyrenean ibex or "bucardo" (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica) became extinct in its natural range, the Pyrenees, at the beginning of the twentieth-first century. Several years later (2014-2021) more than 250 specimens (C. p. victoriae) coming from the same donor population from central Spain were released in four localities of the French Pyrenees. Despite an initial fast demographic increase, the genetic variability of these populations remains low. Moreover, it is expected that genetic variability continues to decline due to genetic drift and that inbreeding accumulates. Here we revise options for genetic rescue or reinforcement of these populations involving future release of animals from different extant Spanish populations, mainly those belonging to the subpecies C. p. hispanica. The future hy-bridization between both phenotypes or "subspecies" may occur anyways in the next years, since currently there is a natural expansion of C. P. hispanica populations from the southern Pyrenees (Spanish side).

AB  - Grazing practices fundamentally shape plant community composition and biodiversity worldwide, more importantly in water-limited environments. This study aimed to investigate plant community composition, species distribution of occurrence and diversity indices in an arid rangeland under different grazing intensities. The quadrat method was used to select 90 x 1 m2 quadrats in heavy-grazing, light-grazing and ungrazed sites. Plant species frequency, relative frequency, abundance, relative abundance and density, as well as species richness, evenness, Shannon diversity index and Simpson's diversity index were calculated. A total of 46 plant species belonging to 17 families were recorded. The Asterace ae family was represented with the highest frequency (28%). Overall in the study area, around 95%, 70% and 40% of recorded plant families existed in light-grazing, ungrazed and heavy-grazing sites, respectively. The species richness of identified plants in light-grazing and ungrazed sites was 300% and 200% greater, respectively, than in the heavy-grazing sites. Around 85% of existing plants in heavy-grazing sites were therophyte plants. The species frequency, abundance, density and diversity indices were higher in light-grazing sites compared to those under heavy grazing, which indicates a more diverse, heterogenous and balanced plant community in the light-grazing site. Plant communities in light-grazing and ungrazed sites were similar, except for higher species frequency, density and evenness in light-grazing sites. This suggests that light-grazing intensities in the arid rangelands of Jordan enhance plant diversity more than grazing exclusion, which encourages decision-makers and environmentalists to implement regulations prohibiting intensive grazing in the arid rangelands of Jordan.

AB  - Browsing can be an environmental stress to forest ecosystems, where the composition and structure of plant communities depend on the balance between ungulate browsing and the ability of plants to tolerate and acclimate to this stressor. Tree planting is a management tool for restoring forest whose integrity has been compromised by the intensity and repetition of browsing. This tool may be insufficient when the stress leading to forest degradation is ongoing. Balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) plantations are used on Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada) to restore winter habitat for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann, 1780). To promote natural regeneration and growth of planted firs that are the staple winter forage of deer, enclosures were temporarily erected and deer densities reduced to decrease browsing pressure. The stress induced by heavy browsing at the time of fence removal and the density of competitors in regenerating cutblocks, however, could compromise fir growth and forest recruitment. Our objective was to identify factors influencing browsing intensity and balsam fir's growth following fence removal. We aimed to identify factors influencing lateral browsing intensity and number of trunk reiterations on fir at the landscape scale, including distance and size of the surrounding forests, and at the local scale through intraspecific density-dependence and interspecific associative effects. We then sought to identify the stressors most influencing balsam fir growth among browsing variables and a neighborhood crowding index (NCI). We measured browsing intensity and growth of 114 balsam firs 8 years following planting and again 2 and 4 years after dismantling two management enclosures. At the landscape scale, our results showed that when balsam fir was more than 150 m from a forest edge, the probability of browsing was close to zero and consistently a low percentage of shelter area surrounding a focal fir led to a decrease in browsing pressure. At the local scale, intensity of lateral browsing increased with the NCI of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). Fir growth was negatively influenced by the additive effects of browsing and NCI. Finally, our results showed that 19.7% (95 %CI: 4.5%, 42.6%) of the effect of the surrounding vegetation on growth was mediated by browsing. The success of forest ecosystem restoration through planting depends on density of neighboring tree species that can generate environmental stress by influencing growth indirectly through browsing as well as directly through competition for resources.

AB  - Patterns of genetic differentiation within and among animal populations might vary due to the simple effect of distance or landscape features hindering gene flow. An assessment of how landscape connectivity affects gene flow can help guide management, especially in fragmented landscapes. Our objective was to analyze population genetic structure and landscape genetics of the native wild boar (Sus scrofa meridionalis) population inhabiting the island of Sardinia (Italy), and test for the existence of Isolation-by-Distance (IBD), Isolation-by-Barrier (IBB), and Isolation-by-Resistance (IBR). A total of 393 Sardinian wild boar samples were analyzed using a set of 16 microsatellite loci. Signals of genetic introgression from introduced non-native wild boars or from domestic pigs were revealed by a Bayesian cluster analysis including 250 reference individuals belonging to European wild populations and domestic breeds. After removal of introgressed individuals, genetic structure in the population was investigated by different statistical approaches, supporting a partition into five discrete subpopulations, corresponding to five geographic areas on the island: north-west (NW), central west (CW), south-west (SW), north-central east (NCE), and south-east (SE). To test the IBD, IBB, and IBR hypotheses, we optimized resistance surfaces using genetic algorithms and linear mixed-effects models with a maximum likelihood population effects parameterization. Landscape genetics analyses revealed that genetic discontinuities between subpopulations can be explained by landscape elements, suggesting that main roads, urban settings, and intensively cultivated areas are hampering gene flow (and thus individual movements) within the Sardinian wild boar population. Our results reveal how human-transformed landscapes can affect genetic connectivity even in a large-sized and highly mobile mammal such as the wild boar, and provide crucial information to manage the spread of pathogens, including the African Swine Fever virus, endemic in Sardinia.

AB  - Unraveling the shifts of soil microbial community structure in response to grazing practices has recently received considerable attention, but how grazing exclusion affect soil microbial compositions, functions, biogeographic patterns and their interactions remains unclear in alpine grasslands. Using high-throughput DNA amplicon sequencing of soil microbial communities across a 600 m elevation gradient with four different vegetation types in a Tibetan alpine meadow, we examined how the structures and potential functions of soil microbial communities changed due to long-term grazing exclusion and thereafter consequences on their biogeographic pattern and co-occurrence network. Grazing exclusion did not significantly change soil microbial community structure and most of alpha-diversities except for a significant reduction in bacterial and archaeal richness by 3.9% and 45.1 % for Shrub and Graminoid meadows, respectively. Meanwhile, the relative abundances of most N-cycling related bacterial genes in Graminoid and Shrub meadows significantly reduced due to grazing exclusion. As a consequence, grazing exclusion enhanced the similarity of soil microbial community structures by 22.2 % on average due to the reduced environmental dissimilarity, and improved the relative importance of stochastic assembly process in structuring microbial communities compared to that under grazing across the elevation gradient. Moreover, grazing exclusion significantly decreased the stability of fungal and bacterial co-occurrence networks and conversely increased the stability of archaeal co-occurrence network. These results suggest that a more random distribution of soil microbial communities across the elevation gradient strengthened by long-term grazing exclusion and a more sensitive response of microbial co-occurrence network attributes than their community compositions to grazing exclusion in the Tibetan alpine meadow even at a narrow elevation scale. Our study highlights long-term grazing exclusion might have a neutral effect on soil microbial diversity, a negative effect on the stability of fungal and bacterial communities and a positive effect on that of archaeal species co-occurrence in the Tibetan alpine meadow.

AB  - It is still not well established whether plant chemical and physical defence traits can be simultaneously induced in savanna trees and how this would affect plant nutritional quality. Here, we use a long-term mammalian herbivore exclosure experiment in a dystrophic semi-arid African savanna to test how chemical (condensed tannins [CTs] and total polyphenols [TPs]) and structural (spines and thorns) defences are affected by herbivore exclusion in five common savanna woody species. We also tested whether nutritional quality interacted with either physical or chemical defences after protected trees were reintroduced to herbivores. Trees that remained available to herbivores did not increase CTs and TPs, rather these were found to be higher without mammalian herbivory in some species. In contrast, herbivory resulted in a significant induction of structural defences (i.e. longer and thicker spines) and at the same time, improved nutritional quality (i.e. higher available crude protein and lower C:N ratios) for some species. We found that the plant defence traits of the treatment which previously excluded herbivores were mostly similar to the control, which both differed from the exclosure, suggesting that legacies of herbivore exclusion on plant defence traits are mostly short-lived.

AB  - Drought-resistant woody communities were once widespread in the intermontane basins and slopes of Molesworth Recreation Reserve, northeastern South Island, New Zealand. These forests, woodlands, and shrublands had established by 6000 years BP, and were largely converted to tussock grassland by fire before 1800 AD. Sheep and rabbit herbivory, and regular burning had altered the vegetation by 1940. From the 1940s, beef cattle grazing was adopted on Molesworth along with repeated aerial over-sowing of exotic pasture grasses and suppression of fires. A series of permanent plots were subjectively located (n = 22), randomly located (n = 80) and paired along fence lines (n = 66) between 1989 and 2008. Plots were re-measured in 2016 to determine vegetation change on Molesworth. We used these data to investigate the effects of cattle grazing and aerial oversowing of exotic pasture grasses on changes in vegetation. Native species richness, cover, and biomass increased between 1989 and 2016. Native herbaceous species cover and biomass increased more at higher elevation and at sites fenced to exclude cattle. Woody biomass, predominantly low-statured native species, increased most on oversown, low elevation slopes in the northern part of Molesworth. The number of exotic species in plots increased at a similar rate to native species, but the biomass of exotic herbaceous species increased at more than twice the rate of native herbaceous species. Data from plots measured in 1952 (n = 24), 1960 (n = 10), 1987 (n = 591), and 2012 (n = 9) were used to show that cover of native species has been increasing for the past six decades, as have woody species, both native and exotic. Restoration of native plant communities on Molesworth requires control of grazing and browsing pressures, ongoing fire suppression and active management of invasive plants.

AB  - Water infiltration plays an important role in water hydrological processes, especially in precipitation-limited drylands. Biocrusts are ubiquitous in drylands which had significant influence on soil water infiltration in most cases, while grazing may affect water infiltration by the disturbance of biocrusts. Toward this end, the effects of grazing on surface land cover characteristics, soil physical attributes, and water infiltration rates were measured at non-grazed area (NG) and five intensities grazing slope grasslands (G1, 2.2 goat center dot hm- 2; G2, 3.0 goat center dot hm-2; G3, 4.2 goat center dot hm-2; G4, 6.7 goat center dot hm-2; G5, 16.7 goat center dot hm-2) by conducting a fenced grazing experiment. Results showed that surface cover characteristics and soil physical properties changed significantly after grazing, especially at the G5 grazing intensity. Grazing decreased the vegetation coverage and biocrust thickness, while it increased biocrust coverage, bare soil coverage, surface roughness, and splitting index (SPLIT) of biocrust, and the influence was related to grazing intensities. Consequently, there was an increase in the water infiltration rate of 24%-47% after G1-G2 grazing, and the stable infiltration rate and average infiltration rate increased about 56% and 33% at G1, respectively when compared with non-grazed area. The infiltration rate decreased sharply when the grazing intensity was below G3, and infiltration rates remained stable when the grazing intensity was over G3. Improvement of soil infiltration under light grazing after one year was due to the changes of soil surface characteristics and biocrusts characteristics. Among them, disturbance, biocrusts thickness, soil surface roughness together explained the increase of initial infiltration rate, and 0-5 cm soil bulk density, biocrust coverage and its thickness together affected the stable infiltration rate. This link points to the possible use of grazing on the slope grassland with widespread biocrusts and their potential use for the management of soil water in drylands ecosystems.

AB  - Combining natural saltmarsh habitats with conventional barriers can provide a sustainable and cost-effective alternative for fully engineered flood protection, provided that a minimal salt marsh width can be guaranteed for a long period. Hence, it is essential to understand both the key factors and management options driving the lateral erodibility/stability of salt marshes.
   We aimed to determine how salt marsh management (i.e. grazing by large vs. small grazers vs. artificial mowing), marsh elevation and marsh age affect soil stability (i.e. soil collapse) and intrinsic lateral erodibility of salt marshes (i.e. particle-by-particle detachment). Soil cores were collected in high and low marshes (above and below 0.5 m MHWL, respectively) of different ages. At these locations, we compared cores from grazed areas to cores inside grazer exclosures, with and without artificial mowing. All cores were exposed to waves in flumes to test their stability and lateral erodibility.
   All soil cores were characterized by a stable fine-grained layer deposited on top of readily erodible sand. The thickness of the fine-grained layer was a key parameter in reducing salt marsh instability (cliff collapse). This layer thickness increased with marsh age and at lower elevations, but decreased with cattle grazing due to compaction.
   The erosion resistance of the fine-grained layer increased with (a) large grazers that compacted the soil by trampling, (b) mowing that excluded soil-bioturbating species, and (c) grazing by small grazers that promoted vegetation types with higher root density.
   Synthesis and applications. Overall, marshes with thinner cohesive and/or fine-grained top layers are more sensitive to lateral erosion than marshes with deep cohesive soils, independently of the management. Grazing and artificial mowing can reduce the erodibility of fine-grained soils, making salt marshes more resilient to lateral erosion. However, compaction by large grazers simultaneously leads to thinner fine-grained layers and lower elevation, potentially leading to more inundation under sea-level rise. Hence, to effectively manage salt marshes to enhance their contribution to coastal protection, we recommend (a) moderate/rotational livestock grazing, avoiding high intensity grazing in sediment-poor systems sensitive to sea-level rise and (b) investigating measures to preserve small grazers.

AB  - Native mammals are suffering widespread and ongoing population declines across northern Australia. These declines are likely driven by multiple, interacting factors including altered fire regimes, predation by feral cats, and grazing by feral herbivores. In addition, the loss of tree hollows due to frequent, intense fires may also be contributing to the decline of hollow-dependent mammals. We currently have little understanding of how the availability of tree hollows influences populations of hollow-dependent mammals in northern Australian savannas. Here, we test the hypothesis that the abundance of hollow-dependent mammals is higher in areas with a greater availability of tree hollows. We used camera-trap data from 82 sites across the savannas of Melville Island, the largest island in monsoonal northern Australia. Royle-Nichols abundance-induced heterogeneity models were used to investigate the biophysical correlates of the abundance of three threatened mammals: northern brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula arnhemensis), black-footed tree-rat (Mesembriomys gouldii), and brush-tailed rabbit-rat (Conilurus penicillatus). Our analyses included two variables that reflect the availability of tree hollows: the density of tree hollows, estimated from the ground, and the density of large eucalypt trees (Eucalyptus and Corymbia spp.). We found no evidence that the abundance of the three hollow-dependent mammals is positively associated with the availability of tree hollows on Melville Island. Despite their reliance on hollow-bearing trees for denning, the abundance of these mammals appears to be more strongly associated with other factors, such as the characteristics of the understory (i.e., shrub density), which affords protection from predators (including feral cats) and access to food resources. Future conservation management should aim to maintain a dense, diverse understory by managing fire and feral herbivores to facilitate the persistence of hollow-dependent mammals across northern Australia.

AB  - Island biogeography theory states biodiversity increases with island size and decreases with distance from mainland source populations; however, the influence of other island characteristics (e.g., presence of neighboring islands) and species traits (e.g., body size) could alter expected patterns. We assessed the influence of island characteristics and species traits on island biodiversity using presence data for 20 mammal species on 70 islands across the Great Lakes of North America. We collated presence data from public databases of species distributions, a literature review, and personal communications with resource managers and researchers. As predicted, islands closer to mainland source populations as well as islands and archipelagoes with larger areas supported greater mammalian species richness. Winter dormant species (e.g., American black bear [Ursus americanus]) occurred less on islands while semiaquatic species (e.g., American beaver [Castor canadensis]) occurred more. Our results broadly support island biogeography theory and highlight the importance of considering archipelago characteristics and species traits for describing island biodiversity. Specifically, we found support for the existence of archipelagic meta-communities whereby archipelago area was a better predictor of mammalian species richness than the area of individual islands and further support for the effects of winter dormancy and semiaquatic lifestyles as species traits predictive of mammal occurrence on islands. Our results may aid restoration and conservation planning including consideration of assisted colonization and invasive species precautions. Further, our dataset provides an important baseline for mammal diversity and distributions in the Great Lakes region.

(2024). Insectivorous birds and bats outperform ants in the top-down regulation of arthropods across strata of a Japanese temperate forest. Journal of Animal Ecology. . Top-down predators exert strong effects on prey populations. Theoretical and empirical studies investigating the cascading effects of predators on biodiversity dynamics and ecosystem functionality have been central to advancing ecology and conservation biology. Yet, how intraguild predation and niche overlap drive the strength and direction of trophic cascades across forest strata is still barely understood. In a study published in this issue, Sivault et al. (2024) investigated the impacts of excluding vertebrate (birds and bats) and invertebrate (ants) predators on arthropod herbivores and plant damage in understory and canopy forest strata. The study finds that birds and bats (but not ants) have negative impacts on herbivore density, which, in turn, benefits plants by reducing leaf damage. Additionally, the effects of vertebrate predators are similar across strata. The authors also show that herbivore density and herbivory are greater in the understory compared to the canopy strata. Sivault et al. (2024) demonstrate that intraguild predation and niche overlap dictate the strength and direction of trophic cascades in forest ecosystems. In addition, these findings shed new light on forest ecology and conservation, especially considering the potential negative effects of climate change on top predators.

AB  - Herbivores alter plant quantity and quality through direct tissue consumption and indirectly via the structural and chemical allocational strategies plants deploy in response to herbivory. Herein, we examine how browsing by white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus alters nutritional quality of six regenerating hardwood species: red maple Acer rubrum, black cherry Prunus serotina, birch Betula spp., pin cherry Prunus pennsylvanica, white ash Fraxinus americana, and American beech Fagus grandifolia. Using an established, large-scale experiment that manipulated deer access to fenced plots, we tested whether browsing altered the nutritional quality and biomass as well as nutritional capacity to support deer of six hardwood species in an early successional hardwood forest of Pennsylvania, USA. Pin cherry was the most nutritious of the six species, with greater dry matter digestibility and digestible protein and lesser neutral detergent fiber. Areas exposed to browsing had less browse biomass of stems and leaves yet greater digestible protein, an effect driven by digestible protein of pin cherry. We found no effect of browsing on neutral detergent fiber or dry matter digestibility. Although deer browsing reduced biomass of the six hardwood species, it did not alter the nutritional capacity to support lactating females in the summer. Our results confirm that browsing limits tree regeneration and available browse and provides conservative conclusions on how deer can alter their diet quality.

AB  - Island populations are at higher risk of extinction than mainland populations. Therefore, understanding the factors that facilitate connectivity is particularly pressing for the conservation of island taxa. Sceloporus occidentalis becki, the Island Fence Lizard, is an endemic taxon restricted to the Northern Channel Islands, part of a nearshore archipelago in Southern California, USA. Since the Last Glacial Maximum, fence lizard habitat on the Northern Channel Islands has decreased with rising sea levels and increasing temperatures that have reduced the availability of woody vegetation. More recently, the introduction (and subsequent removal) of invasive ungulates over the last 170 years and recovery of vegetation has resulted in further dramatic habitat modification. Given the potential for genetic bottlenecks, the history of habitat alteration, and topographic and landscape complexity, we used landscape and population genetic approaches to characterize patterns of genetic diversity and structure of Island Fence Lizards on Santa Cruz Island, the largest of the Northern Channel Islands. Our analyses revealed shallow population structure across the island, low effective population size (N-e = similar to 200), and evidence for a recent genetic bottleneck. Landscape genetic analyses showed that connectivity is facilitated by tree canopy cover and shrubland, as well as by intermediate temperatures, emphasizing the importance of woody vegetation and habitats with variable thermal regimes as the climate warms. Combined, these population and landscape genetic analyses suggest that the Island Fence Lizard is of greater conservation concern than currently appreciated, and increased conservation management focus is warranted for this island endemic.

AB  - Potentilla fruticosa, a major alpine shrubland type, is widely distributed across the Tibetan Plateau, and grazing is the most common disturbance in the shrublands of P. fruticosa. However, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (STN), soil total phosphorus (STP), and their stoichiometry under different grazing intensities were unclear. In our study, we explored SOC, STN, STP, their stoichiometry, and their controlling factors in the grazing disturbance of heavy grazing (HG), moderate grazing (MG), light grazing (LG), and no grazing (NG) conditions in the Tibetan Plateau P. fruticosa shrublands. The grazing intensities were mainly assessed by considering the shrublands' ground cover, the indicators of the road density, the distance between sampling sites and cowshed or sheep shed, the amounts of cow and sheep dung, and vegetation that had been gnawed and stampeded. Our results indicated that soil physical properties of soil temperature and bulk density have decreasing trends with decreasing grazing intensities from HG to NG. The SOC, STN, STP, and soil C:N and C:P ratios have increasing trends with decreasing grazing intensities from HG to NG, while the changes in soil N:P ratio were relatively stable along grazing intensities. Our results indicated that HG generally had stronger effects on SOC, STN, and soil C:N and C:P ratios than NG, indicating substantial effects of grazing disturbance on biogeochemical cycles of SOC and STN in the shrubland ecosystems. Therefore, for the alpine shrubland of P. fruticosa, the HG should be avoided for sustainable cycling of soil nutrients and the balance of soil nutrient stoichiometry. The grazing types can directly affect plant conditions, and plant conditions can directly affect soil physical and chemical properties and litter standing crops. Finally, soil physicochemical properties and litter standing crop resulting from different grazing intensities directly control SOC, STN, and STP. For the soil stoichiometry, the soil's physical and chemical properties resulting from different grazing intensities have direct impacts on soil C:P and N:P ratios.

AB  - Forests in the eastern United States are undergoing wide-scale transformations driven by the combined effects of biological and anthropogenic factors. Understanding how these drivers interact to affect forest dynamics is important for predicting the resilience of forest ecosystem services, but few long-term records exist for oldgrowth forests that have not been directly altered by humans. In this study, we utilized historical datasets covering a 96-year period to investigate temporal changes in forest structure and composition at Trelease Woods, an old-growth temperate forest remnant in central Illinois. Our objectives were to (1) characterize shifts in forest composition and structure, and (2) determine how tree mortality due to biotic invasions may have affected the dynamics. Our findings documented substantial compositional changes across the different census periods. Species richness and diversity both declined over time, with saplings exhibiting markedly lower diversity values. The relative densities and basal areas of sugar maple (Acer saccharum L.) and Ohio buckeye (Aesculus glabra) increased across the sapling (< 10 cm) and mid-sized (10-50.7 cm) strata, while the overstory (> 50.7 cm) has become heavily dominated by sugar maple since 1936. These observed temporal trends suggest that Trelease Woods is experiencing species homogenization likely driven by tree mortality associated with pest and pathogen outbreaks, rising deer populations, and mesophication due to fire suppression. These findings provide insights into the historical compositional and structural shifts that temperate forests in the eastern U.S. have undergone over the past century and the potential implications for future changes in dynamics of old-growth forests in eastern North America.

AB  - We monitored ground-layer vegetation in permanently marked plots in a temperate grassy woodland/sclerophyll forest mosaic, after the removal of sheep, but with continuing macropod grazing. Data collection over 15 years encompassed extremes of drought and high rainfall. Plots were stratified to sample 13 subhabitats reflecting variations in vegetation type and landscape position. Species composition varied with: (i) site productivity (grassy vs sclerophyll forest), (ii) soil moisture (landscape position) and (iii) presence of tree canopies in open grassland. After 15 years, most subhabitats retained their distinctiveness, with net changes suggestive of nutrient decline under tree canopies and increasingly mesic conditions on higher slope positions. Analysis of species richness of 18 origin and life-form groups over time revealed three types of responses: (i) stable, (ii) linear increase and (iii) a quadratic response. The latter was identified for native and exotic species in all habitats, specifically for annuals and short tussocks. There were sustained linear increases in the species richness of three native life forms (geophytes, subshrubs and leafy herbs) suggesting improvements in conservation status, while most native perennial groups were stable. Large perennial native grasses (Themeda triandra, Rytidosperma pallidum, Poa sieberiana and Aristida ramosa) maintained their initial dominance, while that of Lomandra filiformis and Melichrus urceolatus increased. The level of dominance of exotics was largely sustained, although exotic annuals fluctuated in response to seasonal conditions. The frequency of exotic perennial dicots increased slightly, despite intensive control efforts. We attribute the persistence of biomass under severe drought to the high dry matter content of many ground-layer dominants, which served to protect soil and provide refuge to palatable geophytes and native herbs. Our findings are consistent with ecological models that predict that cessation of fertiliser inputs and heavy livestock grazing will promote vegetation with ecosystem attributes resistant to climate extremes.

AB  - Climate change is modifying plant communities and ecosystems around the world. Alpine ecosystems are of special concern on oceanic islands, due to their characteristic higher endemicity percentage, small area and undergoing severe climate change impact in the last few decades. During recent decades there has been increasing interest in the effects of climate change on biodiversity and a range of methods have been developed to assess species vulnerability. However, some new insights are necessary to obtain useful information for species management on oceanic islands. Here in the alpine area of two oceanic islands (Tenerife and La Palma) we evaluate the drivers that best explain the vulnerability of 63 endemic species along three scenarios, covering recent past to present and two future projections (2041-2060 and 2061-2080). The selected drivers were: loss of potential area, mismatch index between potential and occupied areas in different scenarios, and adaptive capacity constraints. We assess the influence of potential area size and whether the drivers of risk and the vulnerability for common, restricted and rare species are significantly different. Our results indicate that management must be widely distributed over the species, and not only focus on restricted species. Evidence for this was that drivers directly deriving from climate change showed no significant differences in their impact on the rarity groups identified. Vulnerability depends partially on the potential area size, showing a more complex picture where constraints on the adaptive capacity of the species have a strong enough influence to modify the effects of the characteristic drivers of climate change.

AB  - This work was done on 1996 and 1997, and presents an extremely valuable baseline to compare the recent and future changes on the insular shallow habitats of the Azorean islands. We examined the structure of the molluscan communities of the macroalgae Halopteris scoparia in Sao Miguel Island (Azores, Portugal). This island was chosen because it is the largest and the most populated of the archipelago, with polluted sites which are not common in the Azores. The relationship between the epifaunal assemblages and a set of environmental factors - geographical location (orientation), seawater temperature, depth, algal volume, degree of disturbance, and degree of exposure to the wave action - was investigated using distance-based redundancy analysis and significant variation in the distribution of richness of assemblages was found. Four environmental predictors were common to all the four analyses implemented (richness and assemblage structure using both AIC and BIC): algal volume (that correlates with algal dry weight), seawater temperature, coastal orientation and depth. Finally, the application in the Azores of this methodology favours a sampling program in Spring-Summer (when disturbance seems to be more susceptible to detection), and the use of H. scoparia in the subtidal zone, as the target alga is recommended due to its large covering of rocky shore substrates.

AB  - Seamounts are vulnerable ecosystems targeted by fishing and potentially by future mineral exploitation. Their abundance, widespread distribution, and heterogeneity of faunal and abiotic components require integrated studies at multiscale to describe spatial patterns and identify environmental drivers needed by conservation plans. There is also a lack of knowledge on seamount benthic ecosystems in some regions, such as the Indian Ocean. These gaps, in the context of Marine Protected Areas establishment in the region, have motivated the present study focusing on the Mozambique Channel Eparses islands and flat top seamounts, along a 10-degree latitude gradient. These structures are characterized by complex volcanic and carbonate geomorphologies at multiscale and are distributed along a highly dynamic turbulent ocean circulation area with large anticyclonic eddies. For the first time, we analysed, from seabed image transects obtained by towed-camera on four seamounts, and two volcanic islands - Bassas da India and Mayotte - external slopes, and from multiscale environmental data, how benthic communities respond to this high habitat heterogeneity at regional, and local scales. This study reveals high discrepancies of benthic megafauna richness, density, and beta diversity among seamounts and among slopes of the same islands. Moreover, at similar latitude, seamounts display higher densities than island slopes. The highest densities found on a seamount of the Glorieuses archipelago are explained by strong currents and flat homogeneous geomorphology. Except on this seamount, the beta diversity is high, despite the quite limited depth range explored (84-734 m) and is the highest on island slopes and Hall Bank, driven by the diversity and hardness of the substrate. Beta diversity is mainly due to taxa turnover, with high contribution of the habitat-forming sponges and cnidarians, together with a few mobile taxa. We identified from biogeographic network analysis 12 dominant faunal assemblages, displaying a patchy distribution, with variability in composition both among and within sites. Currents and primary productivity explain similar to 15% of the observed assemblage structure along the channel, while geomorphology (km scale), topography (60-500 m scale) and substrate (60-m units) explain together 24% of the faunal spatial patterns. Analysis of spatial structures along island slopes detected some small (100-200 m), medium (similar to 1 km) and large scale (similar to 2-6 km) megabenthic community structures, partly explained by topography, substrate, depth, and slope. Despite limited taxonomic identifications for this poorly sampled area, this study reveals an outstanding heterogeneity of megabenthic assemblages at multispatial scales in the Mozambique Channel seamounts and island slopes, in response to the complex hydrography and geology of the area. Further characterization of environmental drivers with greater focus at local scales including hydrographic variables are therefore needed to improve predictions of suitable habitats of vulnerable marine ecosystems.

AB  - Large vertebrate herbivores are ecosystem engineers, provoking cascading effects on soil properties through modifications of plant communities as well as direct modulation of organic matter incorporated into soils. However, most studies have been carried out with domestic ungulates in grasslands, and the effects which predominate in grasslands may not be generalizable to other ecosystems. It is not well understood how trophic rewilding with wild ungulates may affect soil processes, especially in non-grassland systems albeit rewilding of natural areas is a process associated with larger trends of land abandonment, shrub encroachment or land use change. In this study we investigated ungulate herbivore exclusion in two geographically and pedo-climatically equivalent but ecologically distinct contexts: a Mediterranean grassland with domesticated herbivores, and a reforested area populated by a community of wild ungulates. In each context, long-term herbivore exclusion zones were used to understand the effect of herbivores on soil properties and particularly on soil organic carbon (SOC). Samples from the topsoil (0-5 cm) were taken inside and outside the exclosures distributed between the two contexts, and ecosystem-level effects and responses to grazing were investigated. We found that soil properties' response to grazing depended on the ecological context in which the grazing occurred. SOC contents in the grassland increased by up to 37% with grazing, while grazing reduced SOC concentrations by 23% in the rewilded area. In both cases, grazing was also associated with significant alterations of soil microbial biomass, the microbial metabolic quotient (qCO2), and aggregate stability, but the effects were opposite: On one hand, domesticated herbivores in the grassland positively influenced carbon stabilization which was strongly associated with soil microbial processes and characteristics, and additionally the proportion of stable macroaggregates was increased. In contrast, wild ungulate herbivory in the forest ecosystem reduced SOC concentrations, accompanied by decreased microbial biomass and increased microbial maintenance costs, and stable macroaggregates were reduced. The results indicate the importance of ecological context in determining the effect of herbivores on soil properties and processes and suggest that the directionality of effects on SOC may change owing to the predominance of different mechanisms of SOC stabilization. Consequently, this study provides evidence that the management of ungulates in rangelands or forests can be associated with different outcomes as related to crucial soil properties such as SOC contents and aggregation.

AB  - ContextAbiotic filtering, including environmental and dispersal filtering, is frequently observed resulting in reduced diversity and more similar species assemblages following habitat fragmentation. Nonetheless, the significance of competitive exclusion is often underestimated.ObjectivesWe investigated the dominant assembly process among termite communities on land-bridge islands, focusing on species known for their high territoriality. We hypothesized that competitively superior species tend to dominate more favorable habitats, such as larger and less isolated islands. Consequently, we anticipated lower diversity and greater similarity in species assemblages than would be expected.MethodsTermite communities were surveyed using standardized transects on 24 islands. We quantified the standardized effects of island area and isolation on taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity by comparing observed patterns with randomly generated communities (i.e., stochastic process). A phylogenetic generalized linear mixed model (PGLMM) was conducted to examine species-specific responses to environmental factors and competition intensity (i.e., heterospecific abundance).ResultsWe found that taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity were lower than expected on larger and less isolated islands, suggesting that competitive exclusion was the dominant mechanism shaping termite communities in TIL. PGLMM showed that two fungus-growing species with larger body sizes increased with competition intensity, while other species exhibited negative responses. Notably, the abundance of fungus-growing species showed sharper increase with island area and decrease with isolation compared to other feeding groups. These findings demonstrate that competitively superior species prefer high-quality habitats and are more sensitive to habitat fragmentation.ConclusionsOur study highlights the significance of competitive exclusion in shaping termite communities and emphasizes the need to consider both competitive and niche difference among species or functional groups when predict changes in community structure and biodiversity loss resulting from habitat fragmentation.

AB  - Mammals are globally in decline, with habitat loss a primary driver. There are also human-wildlife conflicts, such as elephants destroying crops, which results in the ranges of many large mammal species being fenced off. Yet, how this activity affects functional associations of insects with large mammals has received little attention. Previous work suggests a generalised association with large mammals, as well as a strong response to landscape transformation. Here we assess how well dung beetle diversity tracks large African mammal herbivore diversity across a forestry plantation land use gradient by assessing how dung beetle taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional richness compares to large mammal diversity. We also determine how land use intensity affects dung beetle-to-mammal interaction networks. Dung beetles responded more intensively to an array of large mammals than to differences in land use intensity. Beetles also showed a strong preference for specific mammalian dung, with elephant dung being the most important factor for maintaining local dung beetle diversity. Large mammal abundance, functional diversity, dung beetle phylogenetic richness and number of realised mammal-to-dung beetle interactions were highest in the protected area. Land use intensity categories had distinct mammal and dung beetle assemblages. Transformed areas also have conservation value but provided that there is functional connectivity between remnant vegetation within the modified landscapes. Synthesis and applications. The loss of any native large mammal, especially African elephants, from transformed landscapes is likely to lead to a decline in biodiversity. This suggests that protected areas are essential for the conservation of native biodiversity and its interactions, while well-designed and managed transformed areas can have additional conservation value. African conservation managers and landowners should be encouraged to maintain a diversity of large mammals on their properties to maintain functional diversity and ultimately ecological resilience.

AB  - Ungulate overbrowsing is a growing problem in forests worldwide due to its prolonged and pervasive impact on plant biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. It has been shown that overbrowsing not only reduces plant species diversity and biomass (i.e., direct effects) but also causes a loss of associated trophic levels that could potentially feedback to influence plant community structure (i.e., indirect effects). One of the primary pathways of such indirect effects that have not been fully examined is the impact of overbrowsing on soil microorganisms. Recent studies have shown that soil microorganisms maintain vegetation diversity and drive succession, so it is of critical importance to understand how soil microbial communities might be affected by or protected from the deer impact. To assess the consequence of creating artificial grazing refugia on the structure and composition of soil microbial communities, we compared the distribution and abundance of soil microbial taxa (bacteria, archaea, fungi) at the fenced versus unfenced control sites in the context of a catchment-scale field experiment in Japan. The eDNA metabarcoding analysis of soil microbial communities showed that the numbers of archaea and basidiomycetes fungal species were greater in the fenced site than in the control, while no such pattern was found for bacteria and ascomycetes fungi. Despite the lack of significant influence of the fence treatment on taxonomic composition in the soil fungal communities, their functional guild composition was influenced by the fenced treatment, with significant changes in the abundance of animal pathogens. Thus, although the effect of fencing on soil microbial communities is characterized by complex responses that vary from taxon to taxon, our work suggests that creating ecosystem-scale refugia from deer overgrazing might help sustain certain, if not all, taxa of soil microbial communities.

AB  - Under habitat loss and fragmentation, the intensity of local ecological processes involving species interactions changes pervasively, accelerating local species extinctions, and disrupting essential ecosystem functions. We addressed this issue by examining the direct population drivers of apex predators (five felid species), armadillo mesopredators, leafcutter ants (Atta sexdens and Atta cephalotes), and the indirect effects mediated by their inter-trophic relationships in a similar to 25-yr-old land-bridge island system formed by a hydroelectric dam in the Central Amazon. These trophic groups and pioneer tree abundance were surveyed across 34 variable-sized islands and three continuous forest sites. Leafcutter populations were characterized in relation to their occurrence, colony density, and proportion of inactive colonies, and for each leafcutter response, we considered the direct and/or indirect effects of forest area on each trophic group. Leafcutter occupancy was best explained by the direct model, colony density by either the direct or the indirect model, and proportion of inactive colonies by an indirect model via the effects of pioneer tree abundance. The direct forest area effects were positive for apex predators and leafcutter occupancy, but negative for armadillos and pioneer trees. Yet leafcutter colony density declined in increasingly larger forest areas. The absence or low abundance of apex predators on small islands released armadillo hyper-abundance, which contrary to expectation from top-down control, covaried positively with leafcutter colony density. Finally, the indirect model showed that leafcutter colonies were more active under higher pioneer tree abundances. That leafcutter density increases on smaller islands whenever present is likely attributed to the hyper-abundance of pioneer plants and canopy gaps. Although apex predators apparently suppressed armadillos, the remaining fraction of the food web seems to be controlled by bottom-up mechanisms most likely related the overall low foliage palatability typical of wet evergreen forests. Our findings can be used to inform the long-term viability of forest ecosystems affected by hydropower development in lowland Amazonia.

AB  - Examining the trophic niche overlap of sympatric species is crucial for understanding fundamental concepts of community ecology and for the effective management of multi-species habitats within shared landscapes. Using plant (n = 85) and faecal (n = 300) samples collected in 2020-2021, the diet composition of the scimitar-horned oryx and the dorcas gazelle in the Sidi Toui National Park in Tunisia, was studied. Microhistological procedures combined with the use of n-alkanes and long-chain alcohols as faecal markers, were used to assess diet composition and the overlap of their trophic niches. During the dry season, the diet of the scimitar-horned oryx consisted primarily of Hyparrhenia hirta (L.) Stapf (35.6 %), while the gazelle's diet was dominated by Ziziphus lotus (L.) Lam. (66.4 %). In the wet season, Gymnocarpos decander Forssk. became the main dietary component for both antelope species. Pastoral species consumed by scimitar-horned oryx were richer in fiber fractions (neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber) compared to those consumed by dorcas gazelles, which preferred species with high crude protein content. Our results show low trophic overlap between the two antelope species during both seasons, supporting their long-term coexistence in the park at current population densities.

AB  - Grazing by large mammalian herbivores impacts climate as it can favor the size and stability of a large carbon (C) pool in the soils of grazing ecosystems. As native herbivores in the world's grasslands, steppes, and savannas are progressively being displaced by livestock, it is important to ask whether livestock can emulate the functional roles of their native counterparts. While livestock and native herbivores can have remarkable similarity in their traits, they can differ greatly in their impacts on vegetation composition which can affect soil-C. It is uncertain how these similarities and differences impact soil-C via their influence on microbial decomposers. We test competing alternative hypotheses with a replicated, long-term, landscape-level, grazing-exclusion experiment to ask whether livestock in the Trans-Himalayan ecosystem of northern India can match decadal-scale (2005-2016) soil-C stocks under native herbivores. We evaluate multiple lines of evidence from 17 variables that influence soil-C (quantity and quality of C-input from plants, microbial biomass and metabolism, microbial community composition, eDNA, veterinary antibiotics in soil), and assess their inter-relationships. Livestock and native herbivores differed in their effects on several soil microbial processes. Microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) was 19% lower in soils under livestock. Compared to native herbivores, areas used by livestock contained 1.5 kg C m(-2) less soil-C. Structural equation models showed that alongside the effects arising from plants, livestock alter soil microbial communities which is detrimental for CUE, and ultimately also for soil-C. Supporting evidence pointed toward a link between veterinary antibiotics used on livestock, microbial communities, and soil-C. Overcoming the challenges of sequestering antibiotics to minimize their potential impacts on climate, alongside microbial rewilding under livestock, may reconcile the conflicting demands from food-security and ecosystem services. Conservation of native herbivores and alternative management of livestock is crucial for soil-C stewardship to envision and achieve natural climate solutions.

AB  - Pyric herbivory, a process by which grazing is driven by fire, has been shown to create heterogeneity in fire-prone grasslands. Patch-burn grazing (PBG) is a management tool used to harness pyric herbivory and contrasts with full burn (FB) which fosters homogeneity. Here we provide a comprehensive assessment of plant communities (vegetation composition, diversity, and heterogeneity), soil characteristics, and fire fuel consumption responses to PBG as compared to FB management in two different pasture-types (intensively managed pastures [IMP] vs. less intensely managed seminatural pastures [SNP]) in subtropical, humid grasslands in Florida, USA. In 2017, we established 16 experimental pastures at Archbold Biological Station's Buck Island Ranch that were 16-ha each, eight in IMP and eight in SNP. Of the eight pastures in each pasture-type, four were fully burned in 2017 (FB) while in the other four, one-third of the pasture was burned each year for three years (2017, 2018, and 2019) (PBG). PBG-treated pastures were expected to have greater plant richness, diversity, and structural heterogeneity due to the creation of patch contrast while in FB pastures, we expected homogeneous vegetation structure because patches would all have the same fire history. Fuel consumption by fire was greater in SNP vs. IMP and in burned patches within PBG vs. similar-size areas in FB. Recently burned patches had greater total native richness and Shannon diversity, driven by greater numbers and cover of forbs and sedges, but the magnitude of this response varied among years. PBG pastures had greater structural heterogeneity shortly after fire but this disappeared by the end of the growing season. PBG benefits both conservation and production goals in SNP, but incentive programs may be required to implement PBG in IMP to offset losses in forage production while gaining increased height heterogeneity and potential increases in vegetation diversity.

AB  - Sustainable ecosystem management relies on our ability to predict changes in plant diversity and to understand the underlying mechanisms. Empirical evidence demonstrates that abundance- and functional-based processes simultaneously explain the loss of plant diversity in response to human activities. Recently, a novel indicator based on percent cover (Cover(D)) and maximum height (Height(D)) of the dominant plant species - space resource utilization (SRUD) - has proven to give robust and better predictions of plant diversity dynamics than community biomass. Whether the superior predictive ability of SRUD is due to its capacity to simultaneously capture abundance- and functional-based processes remains unknown. Here, we tested this hypothesis by quantifying mechanistic links between changes in SRUD and biodiversity in response to nutrients and herbivores. Furthermore, we assessed the relative contribution of dominant, intermediate and rare species to reduced density of individuals by combining null model analysis with field experiments. We found that SRUD successfully captured changes in ground-level light availability and changes in the number of individuals to predict plant diversity dynamics, and each of Cover(D) and Height(D) partly and independently contributed to both processes. Comparative results from null model analysis and field experiments confirmed that individual losses of dominant, intermediate and rare species followed non-random processes. Specifically, compared with random loss process, rare species lost proportionally more individuals and thus disproportionately contributed to species loss, while dominant and intermediate species lost less. Our results demonstrate that SRUD captures both abundance- and functional-based processes thus explaining why SRUD provides more accurate predictions of changes in species diversity. Given that rare species can play an important role in shaping community structure, resisting against invasion, impacting higher trophic levels and providing multiple ecosystem functions, reducing the SRU of dominant species could alleviate the risk of exclusion of rare species by mitigating abundance- and functional-based competition processes.

AB  - The process of coral recruitment is crucial to the functioning of coral reef ecosystems and recovery of coral assemblages following disturbances. Fishes can be key mediators of this process by removing benthic competitors like algae, but their foraging impacts are capable of being facilitative or harmful to coral recruits depending on species traits. Reef fish assemblages are highly diverse in foraging strategies, and the relationship between this diversity with coral settlement and recruitment success remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate how foraging trait diversity of reef fish assemblages covaries with coral settlement and recruitment success across multiple sites at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. Using a multi-model inference approach incorporating six metrics of fish assemblage foraging diversity (foraging rates, trait richness, trait evenness, trait divergence, herbivore abundance, and sessile invertivore abundance), we found that herbivore abundance was positively related to both coral settlement and recruitment success. However, the correlation with herbivore abundance was not as strong in comparison with foraging trait diversity metrics. Coral settlement and recruitment exhibited a negative relationship with foraging trait diversity, especially with trait divergence and richness in settlement. Our findings provide further evidence that fish play a role in making benthic habitats more conducive for coral settlement and recruitment. Because of their ability to shape the reef benthos, the variation of fish biodiversity is likely to contribute to spatially uneven patterns of coral recruitment and reef recovery.

AB  - Land abandonment has been increasing in recent decades in Europe, usually accompanied by biodiversity decline. Whether livestock grazing and mowing can safeguard biodiversity across spatial scales in the long term is unclear. Using a 48-year experiment in a salt marsh, we compared land abandonment (without grazing and mowing) and seven management regimes including cattle grazing, early season mowing, late season mowing, both early and late season mowing, and grazing plus each of the mowing regimes on plant diversity at the local and larger scales (i.e. aggregated local communities). Also, we compared their effects on community composition (both in identities and abundances) in time and space. Under land abandonment, plant diversity declined in the local communities and this decline became more apparent at the larger scale, particularly for graminoids and halophytes. All management regimes, except for late season mowing, maintained plant diversity at these scales. Local plant communities under all treatments underwent different successional trajectories, in the end, diverged from their initial state except for that under grazing (a cyclic succession). Year-to-year changes in local community composition remained at a similar level over time under land abandonment and grazing plus early season mowing while it changed under other treatments. Vegetation homogenized at the larger scale over time under land abandonment while vegetation remained heterogeneous under all management regimes. Synthesis. Our experiment suggests that late season mowing may not be sustainable to conserve plant diversity in salt marshes. Other management regimes can maintain plant diversity across spatial scales and vegetation heterogeneity at the larger scale in the long term, but local community composition may change over time.

AB  - Environmental stressors such as land development and climate change impact biodiversity from local to landscape scales. Meta-ecosystem models can be used to represent these important cross-ecosystem interactions, but these models are rarely applied to real ecosystems. Here, we derive a meta-ecosystem model based on empirical data from the island of Newfoundland, Canada to predict how terrestrial disturbances will impact the functioning of small boreal streams. We study the effects of disturbances common in boreal systems: logging, insect outbreaks, unpaved roads, and general human impacts captured by the human impact index. We collect in situ data from 28 streams and analyze geospatial data at three spatial extents to inform the structure and analysis of our meta-ecosystem model. We use disturbance simulations in our meta-ecosystem model to identify mechanisms for how individual terrestrial disturbances affect streams. Top statistical models for our empirical data show that (1) benthic invertebrate biomass and specific conductivity increase with road density, (2) dissolved nitrogen and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) index increase with logging and insect outbreaks, and (3) benthic invertebrate biomass and percent shredders decrease with human impact index. Based on our boreal meta-ecosystem model simulations, logging may change the form of energy entering the aquatic ecosystem and weaken apparent competition between benthic invertebrates, periphyton, and leaf litter. Our unpaved road simulations suggest low sediment loading at our study streams increases habitat heterogeneity. Along with improving our mechanistic understanding of forest-stream ecosystems, our integration of empirical data and mathematical modeling creates a framework for using meta-ecosystem models to inform natural resource management.

AB  - Herbivore-avoided plant patches are one of the initial characteristics of natural grassland degradation. These vegetation patches can intensify the spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrients within these grasslands. However, the effects of non-edible plant patches patches on the spatial heterogeneity of microorganisms have not been sufficiently studied in alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, especially patches formed by herbaceous plants. To answer this question, soil nutrients, plant assembly, and microbial communities were measured inside, around, and outside of Artemisia smithii patches. These were 0 m (within the patch), 0-1 m (one meter from the edge of the patch), 1-2 m (two meters from the edge of the patch), 2-3 m (three meters from the edge of the patch), and >30 m (non-patch grassland more than thirty meters from the edge of the patch). Our results showed that A. smithii patches accumulated more aboveground biomass (AGB) within the patches (0 m), and formed fertile islands with the soil around the patches. Additionally, A. smithii patches increased soil bacterial diversity within (0 m) and around (0-1 m) the patches by primarily enriching copiotrophic bacteria (Actinobacteria), while the diversity of fungal communities increased mainly in the 0-1 m area but not within the patches. Bacterial community diversity was driven by pH, urease, nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC). The contents of soil water (SWC), soil organic matter (SOM), urease, NO3--N, and MBC were the main factors influencing the diversity of the fungal community. This study elucidates the vegetation, nutrients, and microbial heterogeneity and their interrelationships, which are observed in fertile islands of herbivore-avoided plant patches in alpine meadows, and provides further insights into the spatial pattern of nutrients in patchy degraded grasslands.

AB  - Grazing is one of the main human disturbance factors in alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), which can directly or indirectly influence the community structures and ecological functions of grassland ecosystems. However, despite extensive field grazing experiments, there is currently no consensus on how different grazing management approaches affect alpine grassland diversity, soil carbon (C), and nitrogen (N). Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of 70 peer-reviewed publications to evaluate the general response of 11 variables related to alpine grassland ecosystems plant diversity and ecological functions to grazing. Overall, the results showed that grazing significantly increased the species richness, Shannon-Wiener index, and Pielou evenness index values by 9.89% (95% CI: 2.75-17.09%), 7.28% (95% CI: 1.68-13.62%), and 3.74% (95% CI: 1.40-6.52%), respectively. Aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB) decreased, respectively, by 41.91% (95% CI: -50.91 to -32.88%) and 17.68% (95% CI: -26.94 to -8.52%). Soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (TN), soil C:N ratio, and soil moisture decreased by 13.06% (95% CI: -15.88 to -10.15%), 12.62% (95% CI: -13.35 to -8.61%), 3.27% (95% CI: -4.25 to -2.09%), and 20.75% (95% CI: -27.89 to -13.61%), respectively, whereas, soil bulk density and soil pH increased by 17.46% (95% CI: 11.88-24.53%) and 2.24% (95% CI: 1.01-3.64%), respectively. Specifically, moderate grazing, long-durations (>5 years), and winter grazing contributed to increases in the species richness, Shannon-Wiener index, and Pielou evenness index. However, AGB, BGB, SOC, TN, and soil C:N ratios showed a decrease with enhanced grazing intensity. The response ratio of SOC was positively associated with AGB and BGB but was negatively related to the Shannon-Wiener index and Pielou evenness index. Furthermore, the effects of grazing on plant diversity, AGB, BGB, SOC, and TN in alpine grassland varied with grazing duration, grazing season, livestock type, and grassland type. The findings suggest that grazing should synthesize other appropriate grazing patterns, such as seasonal and rotation grazing, and, furthermore, additional research on grazing management of alpine grassland on the QTP is needed in the future.

AB  - This study examines the impact of ungulate browsing on the understory dynamics of the Cansiglio Forest, the only European beech high forest in the Southern Limestone Alps. Utilizing seven pairs of fenced versus unfenced forest stands established over two decades, we assessed how fencing affects understory structure and tree regeneration. Significant differences were found in cover, height and vascular species composition in both tree regeneration and shrub layers. Fenced areas showed a significantly higher number and greater average height of young trees, supporting the hypothesis that ungulate browsing negatively impacts tree regeneration. Despite previous studies attributing the lack of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) regeneration primarily to red deer (Cervus elaphus Linnaeus, 1758) browsing, our findings did not show a significant association of this species with fenced conditions. While Rubus abundance was higher inside fenced areas, overall vascular species richness did not differ. Our results highlight the evident effects of ungulate browsing and suggest the need to consider other factors influencing forest regeneration and understory development. Future research should establish additional study replicates, balanced across diverse site and stand structure conditions, to further explore these dynamics.

AB  - Severe thermal stress events occurring on the backdrop of globally warming oceans can result in mass coral mortality. Tracking the ability of a reef community to return to pre-disturbance composition is important to inform the likelihood of recovery or the need for active management to conserve these ecosystems. Here, we quantified annual, temporal changes in the benthic communities for the three years following mass coral mortality at Jarvis Island-an uninhabited island in the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. While Jarvis experienced catastrophic coral mortality in 2015 due to heat stress resulting from the 2015/16 El Nino, significant annual shifts were documented in the benthic community in the three years post-disturbance. Macroalgal and turf dominance of the benthos was temporary-likely reflecting the high biomass of herbivorous reef fishes post-bleaching-giving way to calcifiers such as crustose coralline algae and Halimeda, which may facilitate rather than impede coral recovery. By 2018, indications of recovery were detectable in the coral community itself as juvenile densities increased and stress-tolerant genera, such as Pavona, exceeded their pre-disturbance densities. However, densities of Montipora and Pocillopora remain low, suggesting recovery will be slow for these formerly dominant taxa. Collectively, the assemblage and taxon-specific shifts observed in the benthic and coral community support cautious optimism for the potential recovery of Jarvis Island's coral reefs to their pre-disturbance state. Continued monitoring will be essential to assess whether reassembly is achieved before further climate-related disturbance events affect this reef system.

AB  - Apex mesocarnivores can have a large influence on the functioning of plant and animal communities. Such effects can be more pronounced in relatively depauperate island ecosystems, especially in the context of a legacy of landscape change and introduced species. One such ecosystem is Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, Canada, where a long history of introduced species and forest harvesting has greatly influenced the composition of the plant and animal communities. Most notably, Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis), an introduced and unchecked invasive species, has interacted with forest harvesting to greatly change the understory structure and composition of those temperate rainforests. Little is known of the habitat ecology of Pacific marten (Martes caurina), the small-bodied apex predator on those islands. We used camera traps to monitor the distribution and habitat ecology of marten across 2 winters. We used mixed-effects logistic regression to test 14 a priori hypotheses represented by statistical models formulated at two spatial scales (100 and 1000 m), with four categories of explanatory factors: sampling bias, forest structure, topography, and human disturbance. Relationships between detections and covariates from the top models revealed that at the 100-m scale, marten were more likely to use habitat that was closer to streams and marine shorelines and that contained a small area of forest harvesting. Marten detections were associated with habitat containing some component of forest edge and road, suggesting foraging behavior adapted to invasive deer, an important source of carrion for marten during winter. The broad use of habitats by Pacific marten suggests that intraguild competition and predation might occur with several species at risk including the endemic Haida ermine (Mustela ermine haidarum). Those two species would likely overlap in diet and distribution when co-occurring across low-elevation coastal habitats. Conservation planning on Haida Gwaii should consider measures that decrease the potential for competition or predation between marten and species at risk.

AB  - Indonesia is a part of the Coral Triangle, the global epicenter of marine biodiversity. As an island nation, fisheries are amongst the main sources of income for Indonesia's economy, but overfishing has depleted fish stocks and degraded habitats, especially in unprotected marine areas. Tanjung Bira in South Sulawesi is an unprotected marine area that possesses understudied marine biodiversity and overlooked potential for sustainable tourism. Currently, research has only been done in a small area in Liukang Loe island, but we hypothesize that the habitats surrounding Bira east, Bira west, and Kambing island also harbor significant levels of marine biodiversity. In this study, we utilized a standardized citizen science effort to investigate the occurrence and to quantify the biomass of specific fish families (Lutjanidae, Serranidae, Carangidae, Scombridae, Sphyraenidae, Lethrinidae, and Scaridae), key fish species (large and vulnerable piscivores), sea turtles, elasmobranchs, and other megafauna in Tanjung Bira and its surrounding area. We discuss the species assemblages, their potential ecological roles, threats, and proposed management strategies for each region to foster coexistence between conservation and community livelihood. Implementing a measure of protection is imperative to ensure the conservation of reef ecosystems, commercially important fishes, vulnerable elasmobranchs, charismatic megafauna and nationally protected species such as the humphead wrasse, sea turtles, and cetaceans.

AB  - Simple Summary Conservation strategies often involve reintroducing species back into parts of their historic range where they no longer occur. Reintroduction efforts can be complicated when there are native species present that might compete with the reintroduced species. Exploring the relationship between the existing and reintroduced species can improve the success of reintroduction efforts. Using information from camera-traps, we examined the extent to which reintroduced oryx and native gazelle display similar activity and space use patterns in Sidi Toui National Park, Tunisia. The two species exhibited minimal spatial overlap within the park and favoured habitats with different vegetation features. Activity patterns relative to time of day and season were similar for oryx and gazelle. Both antelope species were most active at dawn and dusk. Seasonally, activity was lowest for both when conditions were hot and dry and was highest following the rainy season in spring, when new vegetation emerged. The differences in space use patterns can facilitate coexistence between the two species of grazers in Sidi Toui National Park. Habitat diversity can be a key determinant for allowing reintroduced and native species to coexist.Abstract Examining the distribution patterns and spatiotemporal niche overlap of sympatric species is crucial for understanding core concepts in community ecology and for the effective management of multi-species habitats within shared landscapes. Using data from 26 camera-traps, recorded over two years (December 2020-November 2022), in Sidi Toui National Park (STNP), Tunisia, we investigate habitat use and activity patterns of the scimitar-horned oryx (n = 1865 captures) and dorcas gazelle (n = 1208 captures). Using information theory and multi-model inference methods, along with the Pianka index, we evaluated the habitat characteristics influencing species distribution and their spatial niche overlap. To delineate daily activity patterns, we applied kernel density estimation. Our findings indicate minimal spatial overlap and distinct environmental factors determining suitable habitats for each species. Furthermore, we found significant temporal niche overlaps, indicative of synchrony in daily activity patterns, with both species showing peak activity at dawn and dusk. Our results indicated that oryx and gazelle differ in at least one dimension of their ecological niche at the current density levels, which contributes to their long-term and stable coexistence in STNP.

AB  - Polymorphism for immune functions can explain significant variation in health and reproductive success within species. Drastic loss in genetic diversity at such loci constitutes an extinction risk and should be monitored in species of conservation concern. However, effective implementations of genome-wide immune polymorphism sets into high-throughput genotyping assays are scarce. Here, we report the design and validation of a microfluidics-based amplicon sequencing assay to comprehensively capture genetic variation in Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). This species represents one of the most successful large mammal restorations recovering from a severely depressed census size and a massive loss in diversity at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We analysed 65 whole-genome sequencing sets of the Alpine ibex and related species to select the most representative markers and to prevent primer binding failures. In total, we designed similar to 1,000 amplicons densely covering the MHC, further immunity-related genes as well as randomly selected genome-wide markers for the assessment of neutral population structure. Our analysis of 158 individuals shows that the genome-wide markers perform equally well at resolving population structure as RAD-sequencing or low-coverage genome sequencing data sets. Immunity-related loci show unexpectedly high degrees of genetic differentiation within the species. Such information can now be used to define highly targeted individual translocations. Our design strategy can be realistically implemented into genetic surveys of a large range of species. In conclusion, leveraging whole-genome sequencing data sets to design targeted amplicon assays allows the simultaneous monitoring of multiple genetic risk factors and can be translated into species conservation recommendations.

AB  - Restoring populations of large mammals in human-dominated landscapes requires careful planning of conservation strategies. To support such planning for the European bison (Bison bonasus), Europe's largest land mammal currently constrained to small and isolated populations, we parameterized an individual-based, spatially-explicit metapopulation model. We then systematically assessed the impacts of three conservation interventions: 1) connectivity restoration with wildlife overpasses, 2) additional reintroductions, and 3) reduced supplementary feeding to encourage dispersal. Our baseline model projected a doubling of bison abundance in Central Europe within 30 years to >2250 females (in 20 occupied habitat patches), reaching >4300 females (38 patches) within 100 years. Yet subpopulations often remained isolated, highlighting the need for interventions to increase connectivity to prevent a further erosion of already low genetic diversity. Of the interventions we tested, reintroductions were most effective (5 % abundance increase, 10 % patch occupancy increase, on average, after 50 years) and helped establish larger metapopulations that are important for maintaining genetic diversity. Individual wildlife overpasses had a small effect (1 % range increase). Reducing supplementary feeding did not promote range expansion and slightly slowed population growth. We found that the five extant subpopulations in north-eastern Poland could form a viable metapopulation and identified two additional promising regions for such metapopulations: (1) Western Poland/Eastern Germany, and (2) the Eastern Carpathians in Poland/ Slovakia. Overall, our findings underscore the potential for European megafauna recovery, highlight the key role of reintroductions to help megafauna reclaim their historical ranges, and can guide more fine-scale assessments of the social-ecological feasibility of such recoveries.

AB  - Recolonization of predators to their former ranges is becoming increasingly prevalent. Such recolonization places predators among their prey once again; the latter having lived without predation (from such predators) for a considerable time. This renewed coexistence creates opportunities to explore predation ecology at both fundamental and applied levels. We used a paired experimental design to investigate white-tailed deer risk allocation in the Upper and Lower Peninsulas (UP and LP) in Michigan, USA. Wolves are functionally absent in the LP, while deer in the UP coexist with a re-established wolf population. We treated 15 sites each in UP and LP with wolf olfactory cues and observed deer vigilance, activity, and visitation rates at the interface of habitat covariates using remote cameras. Such a paired design across wolf versus no-wolf areas allowed us to examine indirect predation effects while accounting for confounding parameters such as the presence of other predators and human activity. While wolf urine had no effect across most metrics in both UP and LP, we observed differences in deer activity in areas with versus without wolves. Sites treated with wolf urine in the UP showed a reduction in crepuscular deer activity, compared to control/novel-scent treated sites. Furthermore, we observed a strong positive effect of vegetation cover on deer vigilance in these sites. This indicates that simulated predator cues likely affect deer vigilance more acutely in denser habitats, which presumably facilitates predation success. Such responses were however absent among deer in the LP that are presumably naive toward wolf predation. Where human and non-human predators hunt shared prey, such as in Michigan, predators may constrain human hunting success by increasing deer vigilance. Hunters may avoid such exploitative competition by choosing hunting/bait sites located in open areas. Our results pertaining to fundamental predation ecology have strong applied implications that can promote human-predator coexistence.
   Recolonizing and reintroduced predators are increasingly common. We investigated the reaction of two different white-tailed deer populations (a wolf-savvy and a wolf-naive population) to wolf olfactory cues at hunter-bait sites. We found that habitat affected deer vigilance rather than the presence of wolf olfactory cues.image

AB  - The term pyric herbivory was first introduced in 2009, describing how fire shapes herbivory as burned areas attract herbivores and, simultaneously, herbivory shapes fuel load and fire behaviour. Pyric herbivory results in a mosaic of patches with varying levels of herbivory and grazing intensity fire intensity and frequency. The importance of pyric herbivory for ecosystem heterogeneity and biodiversity has been described for North American, Australian and African systems, but the concept remains largely untested in a European context. We introduced fire and herbivory in a full-factorial experiment in a temperate European wood-pasture system to test whether pyric herbivory operates in ways comparable to grassy systems elsewhere in the world. Using camera traps, we observed the behaviour of cattle in burned subplots (49 m2) compared with unburned subplots. We measured grass height and the proportion of the subplot that burned as variables affecting cattle preference and to assess how grazing affects fire behaviour. We also examined the effect on plant species and life-form composition after six seasons of treatment. Cattle spent more time grazing in burned than in unburned subplots in the most productive paddock, where a larger proportion of the subplot burned. The proportion of a subplot that burned was positively related to pre-fire grass height. Moreover, both grass height and the proportion of subplot burned declined in the burned subplots during the 6-year study period and fire and cattle grazing altered the relative cover of graminoids and shrubs (Rubus spp.), with more graminoids in grazed and/or burned subplots and more shrubs in ungrazed subplots at the end of the study. Synthesis and applications. In our temperate European wood pasture, fire and (cattle) grazing interacted in ways comparable to pyric herbivory in grassy ecosystems elsewhere in the world, especially in the most productive paddock. Fire attracted grazing, with cattle grazing longer on subplots that burned more fully. Grazing also affected fire, where over the course of our experiment cattle grazing reduced grass height and the proportion of a subplot that burned. We suggest that pyric herbivory is an interesting management method to further explore in the European context to address the loss of biodiversity in open ecosystems, particularly in more productive sites.

AB  - Increased demand for livestock products is exacerbating conflict with predators in many parts of the world, fuelling an increase in predation management practices in many grazing systems. In Australia, exclusion fences are being erected across broad areas to facilitate the sustained eradication of dingoes, an apex predator, prompting concern for possible cascading effects on extant wildlife populations. We experimentally assessed population trends of mammals, reptiles and ground-dwelling birds inside and outside of two large, fenced areas over a five-year period subsequent to the erection of the fences and the removal of dingoes. Wildlife population abundances inside the fences were always higher or the same as outside the fences, and all wildlife species exhibited similar population trends within each treatment over time. The only exception to this was kangaroo populations, which fluctuated widely inside fenced areas but remained relatively low and stable outside fenced areas. Kangaroos exhibited negative relationships with dingoes, although unmeasured variables limited our ability to quantify specific causes for kangaroo population trends. Vegetation trends were virtually identical between treatments, indicating that wildlife population trends are closely linked to vegetation conditions and not predator abundances. These applied, experimental results demonstrate that top-predator removal does not routinely cause trophic cascades (including mesopredator releases) in Australian rangeland ecosystems. We therefore encourage exploration of opportunities for targeted threatened species recovery in predator-free areas on land used for livestock production.

AB  - Watershed degradation due to invasion threatens downstream water flows and associated ecosystem services. While this topic has been studied across landscapes that have undergone invasive-driven state changes (e.g., native forest to invaded grassland), it is less well understood in ecosystems experiencing within-system invasion (e.g. native forest to invaded forest). To address this subject, we conducted an integrated ecological and ecohydrological study in tropical forests impacted by invasive plants and animals. We measured soil infiltration capacity in multiple fenced (i.e., ungulate-free)/unfenced and native/invaded forest site pairs along moisture and substrate age gradients across Hawaii to explore the effects of invasion on hydrological processes within tropical forests. We also characterized forest composition, structure and soil characteristics at these sites to assess the direct and vegetation-mediated impacts of invasive species on infiltration capacity. Our models show that invasive ungulates negatively affect soil infiltration capacity consistently across the wide moisture and substrate age gradients considered. Additionally, several soil characteristics known to be affected by invasive ungulates were associated with local infiltration rates, indicating that the long-term secondary effects of high ungulate densities in tropical forests may be stronger than effects observed in this study. The effect of invasive plants on infiltration was complex and likely to depend on their physiognomy within existing forest community structure. These results provide clear evidence for managers that invasive ungulate control efforts can improve ecohydrological function of mesic and wet forest systems critical to protecting downstream and nearshore resources and maintaining groundwater recharge.

AB  - Rivers of tropical islands formed by volcanic eruptions experience unpredictable and heavy rainfall and are characterised by irregular topography. During the 2019 and 2020 low-water season, we investigated the responses of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages to variations in local environmental conditions in four rivers located in areas of different rainfall intensity. We found that changes in local environmental conditions associated with lower rainfall intensity reduced abundance and taxonomic richness and modified taxonomic composition but did not impact the balance of functional feeding groups of macroinvertebrate communities amongst streams, except for piercer herbivores. Heterotrophy associated with substrate instability and autotrophy with a more stable substrate co-occurred in semi-arid climate rivers. In contrast, a change from heterotrophy upstream to autotrophy and substrate stability downstream was apparent in the two humid rivers studied. Surrogates of stream ecosystem function revealed a very low ratio of coarse to fine particulate organic matter related to the quasi-absence of shredders in these streams and suggested a low allochthonous input contribution, which could be the result of the 5% decline in forest cover over the two past decades.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) present numerous challenges for maintaining the health of forests in the US Lake States. Although many sources of data exist that provide coarse estimates of deer-browse impacts on plant survival and abundance (e.g., national forest inventories) or examine areas where deer are excluded (e.g., exclosures), few studies exist that use detailed tree seedling measurements across diverse stand conditions and forest types. This study evaluated four years of citizen science data collected in the Assessing Vegetation Impacts from Deer (AVID) program in Minnesota, USA. Results showed that average annual height growth of seedlings for nine browse-palatable species was 1.9 cm. For four of these tree species, annual height growth was not significantly different from zero. These results point to the challenges for the growth and survival of browse-palatable tree species in Minnesota under current deer population levels. Engaging the public through a citizen science project such as AVID showcases the importance of evaluating browse impacts on trees from white-tailed deer while simultaneously providing information to managers and decision makers about this important conservation concern. Study Implications: Citizen scientists can collect data on important conservation issues with ecological implications. This study showcases data provided by volunteers in Minnesota's Assessing Vegetation Impacts from Deer (AVID) program. These results showed that the growth of nine browse-palatable species grew minimally over a four-year span. Citizen science data like these can be used by state wildlife agencies to better understand forest-wildlife interactions and establish wildlife population harvest goals. Measurements of deer browse can also assist researchers by reducing the costs of data collection and providing a geographically diverse data set with detailed measurements of deer impacts to forest vegetation.

AB  - Vegetation is a crucial component of any ecosystem and to preserve the health and stability of grassland ecosystems, species diversity is important. The primary form of grassland use globally is livestock grazing, hence many studies focus on how plant diversity is affected by the grazing intensity, differential use of grazing time and livestock species. Nevertheless, the impact of the grazing time on plant diversity remains largely unexplored. We performed a field survey on the winter pastures in alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) to examine the effects of grazing time on the vegetation traits. Livestock species, grazing stocking rates and the initiation time of the grazing were similar, but termination times of the grazing differed. The grazing termination time has a significant effect on most of the vegetation traits in the winter pastures. The vegetation height, above-ground biomass, and the Graminoids biomass was negatively related to the grazing termination time in the winter pastures. In contrast, vegetation cover and plant diversity initially increased and subsequently decreased again as the grazing termination time was extended. An extension of the grazing time did not have any effect on the biomass of forbs. Our study is the first to investigate the effects of grazing during the regrowth period on vegetation traits and imply that the plant diversity is mediated by the grazing termination time during the regrowth period in winter pastures. These findings could be used to improve the guidelines for livestock grazing management and policies of summer and winter pasture grazing of family pastures on the QTP from the perspective of plant diversity protection.

AB  - Herbivores shape vegetative communities via numerous mechanisms, including browse. We used vegetation monitoring data from Isle Royale National Park to examine woody species change across a nine-year interval, coinciding with herbivore escalation. Here, moose and snowshoe hare are the dominant herbivores, while the gray wolf is the apex predator. Our initial sampling period (2010) followed six years of low moose abundance, while our second sampling event (2019) followed a nine-year escalation in moose density. We tested for change in both saplings and shrubs and compared diameter size distributions of common tree species in three island sections. We found a decline in large saplings of sugar maple, a species limited to the west section of the island. We also saw declines in small saplings of sugar maple, paper birch, and trembling aspen. For some species, including black spruce and white spruce, taxa that are unpalatable to moose, diameter distributions were proportionally larger (i.e., indicative of fewer small individuals) in 2019 than in 2010. In contrast, diameter distributions of black ash in the central section and trembling aspen in the central and east sections of the island were proportionally smaller (indicative of more small individuals) in 2019 than in 2010. We found that similar to 50% of common shrub taxa were more abundant during the second sampling event, while none declined. Our work here brings to light several unanticipated results. While we demonstrated partial recovery of trembling aspen, likely originating during the earlier period of low moose abundance, our results suggest further changes may be attributable to other island herbivores. The response of black ash, a hydric species, may be stemming from a sixfold increase in active beaver sites, while that of spruce may be attributable to a historic spike in snowshoe hare density. We currently have only a limited understanding of the impacts of the island's lesser studied herbivores on overstory regeneration. Further research on these linkages can inform decisions addressing controls on forest structure.

AB  - Globally insects are in decline, with the transformation of natural areas for agriculture one of the most important drivers of this decline. Yet, insects play an important role in regulating ecosystem services such as pollination, soil fertility and pest suppression, so their conservation within agricultural areas is critical. We examined comparative impacts of traditional small-scale low input farming versus large-scale conventional farming systems, and mono-cropped versus inter-cropped systems in Kenyan maize fields on predator, ant and herbivore arthropod species richness and composition. We also considered the value of hedgerows and percentage of surrounding maize cover for arthropod conservation. As expected, traditional farming retained higher herbivore species richness, evenness and abundance, as well as higher predator abundance compared to conventional farming. Percentage maize cover was positively correlated to ant species richness, predator and herbivore abundance, as well as determining species assemblage composition for ants and herbivores. Hedgerow volume and the comparison of mono- vs inter-cropping were important predictors for predator evenness. These results suggest that the low input farming systems retain far higher arthropod numbers, although this does not seem to be due to the use of intercropping on the farms. Rather it seems that hedgerows play an important role in maintaining arthropods. While higher maize coverage surrounding the farm increases the species and abundance of arthropods in the fields, this is most likely due to the high biotope fidelity of arthropods that specialize in open cropping systems such as maize fields. Implications for insect conservation The results here are encouraging as the retention of culturally important farming techniques (i.e., the traditional Kenyan farmers) and small improvements, such as the retention of hedgerows, greatly promotes biodiversity in the farmlands.

AB  - Invasive species are ranked as one of the leading drivers of global biodiversity loss. To mitigate their impact, we must understand the future risks caused by invasive species, particularly to flora of conservation concern. Here we used species distribution modelling (SDM) to project the current and future (RCP45 and RCP85 2050) distributions of four deer species and 13 plant species of conservation concern for the island of Ireland, quantifying changes in distributions and overlap. Large areas of suitable habitat for the deer species were predicted with high accuracy across all counties, with future climate scenarios identifying an expansion in sika deer distributions and a decrease in muntjac and fallow deer distributions. Red deer declined under the moderate climate change scenario but increased under the worst-case projection. Future projections predicted the (local) extinction of six (out of 13) endangered and vulnerable plant species. An expansion in distributions was observed for four plant species; however, these areas had large overlap with the future predictions of deer, placing further pressures on these plant species. These findings suggest that targeted conservation and management measures are required to alleviate the pressures on 'at-risk' plant species due to grazing from native and non-native deer.

AB  - In contrast to the modern Arctic, high-latitude ecosystems of the Late Pleistocene supported a diverse range of large mammalian herbivores, including abundant bison (Bison priscus) and horses (Equus sp.). This 'mammoth steppe' biome has no extant analog and modern tundra vegetation is likely incapable of supporting such a high density of large mammals. Compared to modern Arctic ecosystems, higher diversity and biomass of Late Pleistocene large mammal populations may have been sustained by more nutritious forage and/or dietary niche partitioning. We used dental microwear texture analysis and dental mesowear analysis of bison and horses (Bison priscus, Equus sp.) to characterize diet and assess the degree to which dietary differences supported co-existence of these dominant and likely competing herbivores on the mammoth steppe. Additionally, we compared microwear and mesowear of Late Pleistocene specimens to modern Alaska bison (reintroduced Bison bison athabascae and introduced Bison bison bison) and published microwear and mesowear data for extant bovids and equids. Our results demonstrate that Late Pleistocene bison and horses had less abrasive diets than modern obligate grazers, suggesting that these "grazers" of the mammoth steppe likely incorporated more forbs in their diets than modern grazers. Furthermore, Late Pleistocene bison and horses ate foods with similar textures, indicating that dietary niche partitioning alone cannot explain their co-occurrence. However, taphonomic differences between bison and horse specimens indicate potential spatial or temporal niche partitioning during the Late Pleistocene.

AB  - Deer herbivory has a reputation for suppressing tree seedling development in Northern hardwood forests. We examined survival and growth of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and ash (Fraxinus spp.) seedlings in a controlled factorial experiment with differing light conditions and levels of deer access in a Northern hardwoods forest in Wisconsin, USA. Measurements were made in similar to 380 m(3) harvest gaps, in transition zones adjacent to gaps, and under closed canopy conditions, both inside and outside of deer exclosures. Browse incidence was initially greater in unfenced treatments, but a general decline through time eliminated this difference. Seven-year sur-vival of both species groups was correlated positively with initial root collar diameter (RCD) and was greater in transition zones. Ash seedling survival was greater in plots with greater overall seedling aggregate height. Soils were primarily differentiated by available nitrogen, which positively influenced height growth of sugar maple in transition zones but did not influence ash growth. Although sugar maple height growth was correlated positively with initial RCD, greater initial height reduced growth rates, both as a simple effect (sugar maple) and in combination with initial RCD (ash). Ash growth correlated negatively with seedling aggregate height in gaps but was unaffected in transition or canopy zones. Allometric coefficients of RCD:height indicated some influence of deer herbivory which was not detected in other analyses. Coefficient values trended downward from year 2 to year 9, but wide confidence intervals limit the value of this metric as an indicator of seedling community resilience with regard to deer.

AB  - Forest management can affect both the functioning and stability of ecosystems. Constancy and persistence are key factors that contribute to the overall stability of an ecosystem. These factors can be highly variable and change across forest ecosystems. We studied the effects of forest management on the strength of resource-consumer interactions (bird predation and insect herbivory) as important measures of ecosystem functioning, as well as on their constancy in time in four different forested regions globally. Within each region, we selected (i) three heavily managed or plantation forests, and (ii) three urban/peri-urban forests or urban plantings, and paired each of them with pristine/semi-natural forests. Bird predation was estimated using plasticine caterpillars of different colors. Chewer, galler, and miner herbivory on leaves were estimated for 15 plants (shrubs and trees) per study site. Constancy was quantified as the invariability of both predation and herbivory during a period of three (exceptionally two) years. We found no consistent responses of either predation or herbivory to forest management practices across study regions. Bird predation was higher in urban/peri-urban forests than in pristine/semi-natural forests in Patagonian and boreal forest, with intermediate levels of predation in managed or plantation forests. These differences might be explained by the increase of resource availability during the winters and by the higher abundances of generalist predators due to increase of temperatures (i.e., urban heat effect), for those regions where winter temperatures could be a limiting factor. Chewing insect herbivory was lower in urban/peri-urban forests, probably due to the exclusion of certain herbivores in response to warming and the higher predation pressure relative to pristine forests. No differences were found in other types of herbivory, indicating that effects of urbanization are guild-specific. In addition, we consistently found no effects of forest management practices on predation invariability and herbivory, thereby demonstrating the high constancy of ecosystem functioning to different forest management practices across regions. These findings advance our knowledge of the generalized effects of forest management on ecosystem functions and stability by establishing a connection between the ecology and management and conservation of plantations and natural forests.

AB  - Although herbivory and allelopathy play important roles in plant invasions, their roles in mediating the effect of plant diversity on invasion resistance remain unknown. In a 2-year field experiment, we constructed native plant communities with four levels of species richness (one, two, four, and eight species) and used a factorial combination of insecticide and activated carbon applications to reduce herbivory and allelopathy, respectively. We then invaded the communities with the introduced plant Solidago canadensis L. One year after the start of the experiment, there was no statistically significant net effect of species richness on biomass of the invader. However, a structural equation model showed that species richness had a positive direct effect on invader biomass that was partially balanced out by a negative indirect effect of species richness via increased light interception. In the second year, the relationship between invader biomass and species richness was negative when we analyzed the treatment combination with herbivory and allelopathy separately. Therefore, we conclude that joint effects of herbivory and allelopathy may play major roles in driving the diversity-invasibility relationship and should be considered in future studies.

AB  - There are several mechanisms that allow plants to temporarily escape from top-down control. One of them is trophic cascades triggered by top predators or pathogens. Another is satiation of consumers by mast seeding. These two mechanisms have traditionally been studied in separation. However, their combined action may have a greater effect on plant release than either process alone. In 2015, an outbreak of a disease (African swine fever, ASF) caused a crash in wild boar (Sus scrofa) abundance in Bialowieza Primeval Forest. Wild boar are important consumers of acorns and are difficult to satiate relative to less mobile granivores. We hypothesized that the joint action of the ASF outbreak and masting would enhance regeneration of oaks (Quercus robur). Data from ungulate exclosures demonstrated that ASF led to reduction in acorn predation. Tree seedling data indicated that oak recruitment increased twofold relative to pre-epidemic period. Our results showed that perturbations caused by wildlife disease travel through food webs and influence forest dynamics. The outbreak of ASF acted synergistically with masting and removed herbivore top-down control of oaks by mobile consumers. This illustrates that the ASF epidemic that currently occurs across Europe can have broad effects on forest dynamics.

AB  - The genus Caulerpa has attracted much attention because many of its species were introduced into non-native regions and became notoriously invasive. This is the case of Caulerpa prolifera that has been rapidly expanding in Ria Formosa lagoon, taking over the deeper unvegetated soft bottoms and competing with seagrass meadows in the shallower areas. Here we address how C. prolifera invasion may affect the support of biodiversity, and specifically, the provision of habitat and nursery for commercial species by the native habitats of this coastal lagoon. Even though no significant differences in total species richness, diversity and evenness were found between C. prolifera and the native unvegetated habitat, the dissimilarity between these two habitats was highest, mostly driven by the extreme reduction of the gastropod Bittium reticulatum and of the tanaid Apseudopsis formosus. This may implicate changes in the trophic interactions of the ecosystem, for example decreasing the tanaid food source for seahorses, which are presently endangered in the lagoon. On the other hand, the fauna species richness, diversity and evenness were significantly higher in the native seagrass habitat than in C. prolifera. Juveniles of valuable flat and sparid fish were only observed in unvegetated sediments and seagrass meadows, respectively. The aggressive spread of C. prolifera in Ria Formosa may alter the structure of native faunal communities, with likely negative implications on fisheries. Nevertheless, the global biodiversity of the lagoon will not be likely drastically affected unless the seaweed takes over the seagrass meadows.

AB  - Large mammals (megafauna) are disproportionately important for ecosystem functioning and biodiversity, but have been lost to disproportionate degrees, mostly in prehistoric times. Against the background of scientific knowledge regarding the state of ecosystems before a man-made wave of extinctions significantly reduced the numbers and diversity of megafauna on most continents, this article examines how (inter)national law and policy relate to efforts to restore large herbivores, omnivores and carnivores to terrestrial ecosystems around the world. Such megafauna rewilding, involving the (re)introduction of vanished species or proxies thereof, poses significant challenges to current laws and policies at national and domestic levels. These tend to have institutionalised a collective amnesia and myopia regarding what is 'natural' and 'indigenous'. The success of future megafauna restoration efforts will partly depend on an understanding of what it takes to navigate, adjust or redesign applicable legal frameworks, and the article tables a research agenda to that end.

AB  - Context. Invasive species are major drivers of biodiversity loss, requiring management to reduce their ecological impacts. Population genetics can be applied to delineate management units, providing information that can help plan and improve control strategies. Aim. The present study aims to use a genetic approach to test the existence of three previously proposed sambar deer populations in south-eastern Australia. In doing so, the study aims to delineate management units of sambar deer in southeastern Australia. Methods. Sambar deer DNA was sourced opportunistically from tissue samples and targeted scat collection. Samples were collected from three areas in Victoria, south-eastern Australia: Mt Cole (MC), French Island (FI) and eastern Victoria (EV). Contemporary population structure was assessed using a suite of 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers. The number of maternal sambar deer lineages in south-eastern Australia was investigated through sequencing of the mitochondrial (mt)DNA control region. Key results. Three distinct genetic clusters were identified. Differentiation among inferred clusters was found to be high, with FST ranging from 0.24 between EV and FI clusters and 0.48 between MC and FI clusters. Two mtDNA haplotypes were identified; R.u1 was found throughout EV and FI, and R.u2 was unique to MC. DNA isolated from scats provided reliable data and proved critical for sampling areas where hunting and culling of deer are not generally undertaken. Conclusions. Three genetically distinct sambar deer management units in south-eastern Australia are defined - MC, FI and EV. Sambar deer control strategies should be applied to each management unit independently. This may be difficult or infeasible for the EV management unit, which is large and geographically complex. Further research may help identify additional fine-scale genetic structure in EV, allowing smaller, more practicable management units to be identified. Implications. Genetic data can be used to identify management units for invasive species, which will be critical for the development of future management strategies and improving control operations. The approach outlined here could also be applied to improve the management of other introduced deer species in south-eastern Australia.

AB  - Resolving the relative contributions of top-down versus bottom-up drivers of vegetation dynamics is a major challenge in drylands. In the coming decades, growing livestock populations and shifts in water availability will simultaneously impact many arid systems, but a lack of empirical data on plant responses to these pressures limits understanding of how plants will respond. Here, we combine ground and drone observations from an herbivore exclosure experiment to identify ungulate visitation patterns and their impacts on the cover and melon production of !nara (Acanthosicyos horridus), a large, long-lived desert plant in the hyper-arid Namib Desert. !Nara are of key ecological, social, and economic importance to Namib ecosystems and to the local Topnaar people. At our study site, we find that among native and domestic herbivores, free-ranging donkeys have the largest impact on !nara cover and melon production. !Nara cover was negatively affected by herbivores close to the desert-ephemeral river ecotone during a dry period, whereas !nara cover increased on all plants across the landscape during a wetter period, regardless of herbivore access. !Nara near the river channel and those protected from herbivores had more mature melons, particularly during the wetter period. At this site, the potential for conflict between Topnaar !nara melon harvesting and pastoral practices varies with a plant's distance from the river and prevailing abiotic conditions. This work advances monitoring approaches and adds empirical support to the understanding that top-down and bottom-up regulation of plant dynamics varies with spatiotemporal context, even within landscapes.

AB  - The hypothesized main drivers of megafauna extinctions in the late Quaternary have wavered between over-exploitation by humans and environmental change, with recent investigations demonstrating more nuanced synergies between these drivers depending on taxon, spatial scale, and region. However, most studies still rely on comparing archaeologically based chronologies of timing of initial human arrival into naive ecosystems and palaeontologically inferred dates of megafauna extinctions. Conclusions arising from comparing chronologies also depend on the reliability of dated evidence, dating uncertainties, and correcting for the low probability of preservation (Signor-Lipps effect). While some models have been developed to test the susceptibility of megafauna to theoretical offtake rates, none has explicitly linked human energetic needs, prey choice, and hunting efficiency to examine the plausibility of human-driven extinctions. Using the island of Cyprus in the terminal Pleistocene as an ideal test case because of its late human settlement (similar to 14.2-13.2 ka), small area (similar to 11 000 km(2)), and low megafauna diversity (2 species), we developed stochastic models of megafauna population dynamics, with offtake dictated by human energetic requirements, prey choice, and hunting-efficiency functions to test whether the human population at the end of the Pleistocene could have caused the extinction of dwarf hippopotamus (Phanourios minor) and dwarf elephants (Palaeoloxodon cypriotes). Our models reveal not only that the estimated human population sizes (n = 3000-7000) in Late Pleistocene Cyprus could have easily driven both species to extinction within < 1000 years, the model predictions match the observed, Signor-Lipps-corrected chronological sequence of megafauna extinctions inferred from the palaeontological record (P. minor at similar to 12-11.1 ka, followed by P. cypriotes at similar to 10.3-9.1 ka).

AB  - Birds often prey on agricultural pests, potentially making them effective pest management agents; thus, changes in bird populations may have impacts on plant health. Using an exclosure treatment, we test whether birds reduce herbivore damage and increase crop yield on the island of Luta in the Mariana Island chain. We focused on Luta because the nearby island of Gu & aring;han has experienced widespread bird loss due to an invasive snake, and thus, this experiment simulating bird loss could provide an indication of potential cascading impacts to agriculture on Gu & aring;han. We planted two crops-eggplant and long bean-within bird exclosure and control treatments at three working farms, and measured herbivore damage, crop yield, and spider web abundance in the presence and absence of birds. The influence of birds varied among crops and farms. Herbivore damage did not differ between treatments in long bean, but damage was greater for eggplant in the absence of birds at one farm ("Farm 3"). Yield of eggplant did not differ between treatments, but yield and weight of long bean was lower in the absence of birds at Farm 1. Spider webs were 270% greater in the absence of birds at Farm 1, whereas spider webs were more abundant in the presence of birds at the other two farms. These results suggest that birds may control pest populations, but the effects vary depending on the crop and environmental context.

AB  - Big Pine Key, Florida, is home to one of Earth's largest swaths of the critically-endangered dry forests. Known as pine rocklands, this fire-adapted ecosystem must experience regular fire to persist and remain healthy. Pine rocklands are composed of a sole canopy species: the South Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii var. densa), along with a dense understory of various woody and herbaceous species, and minimal surface moisture and soil development. Slash pine record wildfire activity of the surrounding area via fire scars preserved within the annual tree rings formed by the species. Our study used dendrochronology to investigate the fire history of the pine rocklands on Big Pine Key, specifically within and around the National Key Deer Refuge (NKDR) because it is the largest segment of unfragmented pine rockland on the island. We combined the results found within the NKDR with those of a previous study completed in 2011, and incorporated historical documents and reports of prescribed and natural fires through November 2019 into our evaluation of fire history on Big Pine Key. We conclude that prescribed burning practices are vital to truly restore natural fire behavior, and repeated burning on these islands in the future must be prioritized.

AB  - Macrozoobenthos communities play significant ecological roles in coral reef ecosystems. However, they are frequently overlooked due to their cryptic appearance, and their diversity remains undiscovered, particularly in Indonesia. This comprehensive review of publications on the macrozoobenthos in the coral reef ecosystems of Java - the most populated island in Indonesia, was conducted to compile a species list and gain an overview of its community composition. We also assessed the existence of species that are frequently reported, endemic, protected, and threatened. Data analysis was performed with data from 53 publications appearing from the 1980s to 2022. In total, 482 species belonging to 4 phyla and 9 classes have been recorded. Mollusca is the most speciose phylum (n = 321), followed by Echinodermata (n = 106), Arthropoda (n = 49), and Platyhelminthes (n = 6). Generally, the northern part of Java is well studied and has larger numbers of recorded phyla and species. The highest species number (n = 266) has been recorded off the northern coast of West Java, while there are around 25-99 species in other regions. Echinoderms species such as Culcita novaeguineae, Diadema setosum, Echinothrix calamaris, and Holothuria atra had relatively higher occurrences than other taxa. We also noted the occurrence of giant clam Hippopus hippopus, which is protected by Indonesian law. This review provides fundamental knowledge of macrozoobenthic diversity in the coral reefs of Java, making it available to global audiences. However, it revealed a lack of research on benthic fauna in several areas with moderate to good coral cover conditions. Further research is needed to explore macrozoobenthic species richness in this region thoroughly, and periodic monitoring is essential to provide early warnings of possible changes and biodiversity loss.

AB  - We estimated the population density and investigated the social organization of sambar (Rusa unicolor unicolor) in Horton Plains National Park (HPNP), Sri Lanka. Distance sampling was conducted along six strip transects every month for a period over 3 years (2018-2020) to estimate the density of the sambar population in grasslands of HPNP (9.4 km(2)), while the antler stage of males and the behavior of individuals were recorded to describe the population's reproductive stage and hence the social organization. Population density estimates showed relative stability over the 3 years and varied over the seasons but with consistent peaks from year to year with the highest population densities recorded in November-December (212.93 & PLUSMN; 25.38 animals/km(2) in 2018, 187.91 & PLUSMN; 28.51 in 2019, and 179.76 & PLUSMN; 31.85 in 2020). The highest percentage of males in hard antlers was observed from November through January, while the percentage of antlers cast sambar peaked from March to April each year. Hinds were observed with newborn calves throughout the year, but the highest number of newborn calves were recorded from July to August each year, while the number of calves counted each year varied from 210 to 267 individuals. The mean group size was variable throughout each year with the largest groups recorded from September to December (up to 52), the period accompanied by the most observations of mating and sparring behavior. Although on a tropical island, HPNP is situated on a rolling plateau landscape in the highlands, where sambar showed a degree of reproductive seasonality somewhat similar to temperate cervid species.

AB  - Despite the widespread adoption of motion-triggered camera traps, studies using camera traps to characterize wildlife communities in residential areas in North America are limited. To fill this data gap, we placed camera traps over three seasons in 22 residential neighborhoods within Dutchess County, NY. To account for imperfect detection, we applied individual-level and community-level Bayesian site-occupancy models to these data. Overall, we captured 64,639 independent detections over 17,820 camera trap days. We detected between 17 and 22 mammal and non-passerine bird species in each of the seasons of data collection, while our community models estimated between 24 and 33 mammal and non-passerine bird species in each season. Small, cryptic species were not reliably captured by camera traps, limiting our ability to model their occupancy. We identified five species: raccoons (Procyon lotor), eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) found in all neighborhoods. The most common covariate included in our final occupancy models was the percent of area within each neighborhood that was an impervious surface, which positively affected occupancy for some species, and negatively affected occupancy for others. Forest cover, the second most common variable in our final models, negatively affected occupancy for all species. Our estimates characterize a baseline for quantifying species richness and composition in residential areas of Dutchess County, NY and surrounding regions, and offer a comparison to similar studies in natural areas. Overall, the results improve understanding of how residential landscapes affect individual species and communities.

AB  - Habitat loss from human impacts can lead to functional homogenization, whereby natural communities become less diverse. Herbivorous coral reef fishes display varying specialization and unique functional roles among closely related taxa, making homogenization relevant to ecosystem function. To explore whether the functional homogeneity of herbivore assemblages correlate with human impacts, we combined an index of diet specialization and a functional trait matrix with fish abundance data for > 3000 sites across the Pacific that encompass intact to degraded coral reefs. We determined the relative abundance of specialized species and the functional dissimilarity in an assemblage. Assemblage composition varied between islands, regions, and human population densities, with generalist species such as Acanthurus nigrofuscus dominating in highly populated locations. Spatial patterns and variability in the relationship between herbivorous reef fish assemblages and human impacts showed local and indirect effects. Despite broad variability, herbivore diversity decreased with human impacts among populated islands, consistent with the hypothesis that human impacts can lead to functional homogenization of coral reef fish communities.

KW  - HISTORY
AB  - Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica Houtt) is a successful invasive species for a multitude of reasons that include: anthropogenic cultivation, vegetative reproduction, allelopathy, and competitive exclusion, as well as enemy release from native herbivores. An adequate biological control agent has been sought to help control its dominance and spread, though the most recent control agents have failed to establish and control the plant in field studies. This paper represents hope that R. japonica can be controlled or have its dominance reduced on the landscape by a dominant North American herbivore, the white-tailed deer. Our study confirmed that a population of white-tailed deer in Central New Jersey are intentionally and significantly consuming R. japonica to a level that alters the growth of the plant. Our results support the findings of other studies in that R. japonica reduces species richness within the plant community and reduces the area covered by other plants. We did not find a relationship between the amount of plant damage (leaves lost) to canopy coverage of R. japonica, likely because the plants growth form still produces shade by becoming stout with more branching rather than tall and overhanging. The herbivory of R. japonica by this population of white-tailed deer likely stems from an unusually high population density of deer in this suburban area that drove them to seek alternative food resources. This study is another example of the ability of native herbivores to eventually form new relationships with invasive plants, and it provides hope for the biological control of R. japonica by native species in the future.

AB  - Context. A central problem in road ecology is the need to minimise roadkill without exacerbating fragmentation. The best current solution to this problem is wildlife-exclusion fencing combined with crossing structures. However, because species vary in their propensity to use crossing structures, optimising their design for a suite of species remains a challenge. Aims. We investigated medium- and large-mammal use of undercrossings along Highway 101 in the Central Coast of California. Specifically, we quantified how undercrossing size, surrounding habitat, and the presence of a wildlife-exclusion fence, influenced overall species richness, as well as use by black bear, mule deer, puma, and bobcat. Methods. Using wildlife cameras, we documented mammal use at 11 undercrossings in our study area. We calculated the openness index of each undercrossing and remotely measured habitat features, such as percentage tree cover, and distance to nearest stream. We determined the relative importance of these factors on overall species richness, and the activity of focal species, using generalised linear mixed models in an information-theoretic framework. Key results. Mesocarnivores used a wider variety of undercrossings, and used them more frequently, than did larger mammals. Species richness and bear activity were greater closer to streams, and there was more bear activity at undercrossings within the wildlife-exclusion fence zone than outside it. Deer activity was strongly and positively related to undercrossing openness. Our puma and bobcat analyses were uninformative, likely because we detected puma too infrequently, and because bobcats showed little variation in use across sites. Conclusions. Our results support previous research highlighting natural travel corridors (e.g. riparian areas) as important places for wildlife crossings, both for a diversity of medium-large mammals and a low-density large carnivore. Ungulates may be the most selective taxa in respect to undercrossing use. Implications. Large, open undercrossings along natural travel routes accommodate the greatest diversity of medium-large mammal species.

AB  - Several caribou (Rangifer tarandus) populations co-occur with endemic or introduced populations of muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus), which has led to concerns about the potential competition between the species, especially in regions where the growth of muskoxen populations coincides with caribou declines. We evaluated the potential for competition between migratory caribou and an introduced muskoxen population in northern Quebec, Canada, at multiple spatial scales, from 2017 to 2019. We investigated space use and habitat selection patterns of satellite-collared caribou and muskoxen, and analyzed fecal samples using DNA metabarcoding to assess diet overlap. Annual overlap between ranges was low and occurred primarily during caribou spring migrations on the coast of Hudson Bay, and during summer on the coast of Ungava Bay. During spring, muskoxen selected shrub-dominated areas close to the coast, whereas caribou selected rock-substrate tundra and low elevations within their overlapping ranges. Thus, co-occurrence was low and remained limited to the vicinity of the Hudson Bay. In summer, muskoxen selected productive coastal areas and caribou selected erect-shrub tundra; both species selected prostrate-shrub tundra. This led to a higher co-occurrence in the Ungava Bay study area relative to the Hudson Bay study area. We found similarities in the diets of the 2 species at the plant family level, with shrubs being commonly consumed by both species across seasons. We conclude that, at a broad spatial scale, there was limited potential for seasonal space use and diet overlap between caribou and muskoxen in our study area. Still, multiple sources of uncertainty remain such as local impacts of herbivory by muskoxen, demographic and distribution patterns of both species, trophic interactions with predators, shared diseases and parasites, and climate change. These sources of uncertainty could be mitigated through the elaboration of local management plans and community-based monitoring.

AB  - Populations of large mammals have declined at alarming rates, especially in areas with intensified land use where species can only persist in small habitat fragments. To support conservation planning, we developed habitat suitability models for the Walia ibex (Capra walie), an endangered wild goat endemic to the Simen Mountains, Ethiopia. We calibrated several models that differ in statistical properties to estimate the spatial extent of suitable habitats of the Walia ibex in the Simen Mountains, as well as in other parts of the Ethiopian highlands to assess potentially suitable areas outside the current distribution range of the species. We further addressed the potential consequences of future climate change using a climate model with four emission scenarios. Model projections estimated the potential suitable habitat under current climate to 501-672 km(2) in Simen and 6,251-7,732 km(2) in other Ethiopian mountains. Under projected climate change by 2,080, the suitable habitat became larger in Simen but smaller in other parts of Ethiopia. The projected expansion in Simen is contrary to the general expectation of shrinking suitable habitats for high-elevation species under climate warming and may partly be due to the ruggedness of these particular mountains. The Walia ibex has a wide altitudinal range and is able to exploit very steep slopes, allowing it to track the expected vegetation shift to higher altitudes. However, this potential positive impact may not last long under continued climate warming, as the species will not have much more new space left to colonize. Our study indicates that the current distribution range can be substantially increased by reintroducing and/or translocating the species to other areas with suitable habitat. Indeed, to increase the viability and prospects for survival of this flagship species, we strongly recommend human-assisted reintroduction to other Ethiopian mountains. Emulating the successful reintroduction of the Alpine ibex that has spread from a single mountain in Italy to its historical ranges of the Alps in Europe might contribute to saving the Walia ibex from extinction.

AB  - Identifying local adaptation in bottlenecked species is essential for conservation management. Selection detection methods have an important role in species management plans, assessments of adaptive capacity, and looking for responses to climate change. Yet, the allele frequency changes exploited in selection detection methods are similar to those caused by the strong neutral genetic drift expected during a bottleneck. Consequently, it is often unclear what accuracy selection detection methods have across bottlenecked populations. In this study, simulations were used to explore if signals of selection could be confidently distinguished from genetic drift across 23 bottlenecked and reintroduced populations of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). The meticulously recorded demographic history of the Alpine ibex was used to generate comprehensive simulated SNP data. The simulated SNPs were then used to benchmark the confidence we could place in outliers identified in empirical Alpine ibex RADseq derived SNP data. Within the simulated data set, the false positive rates were high for all selection detection methods (F-ST outlier scans and Genetic-Environment Association analyses) but fell substantially when two or more methods were combined. True positive rates were consistently low and became negligible with increased stringency. Despite finding many outlier loci in the empirical Alpine ibex SNPs, none could be distinguished from genetic drift-driven false positives. Unfortunately, the low true positive rate also prevents the exclusion of recent local adaptation within the Alpine ibex. The baselines and stringent approach outlined here should be applied to other bottlenecked species to ensure the risk of false positive, or negative, signals of selection are accounted for in conservation management plans.

AB  - Seismic lines are linear clearings created for oil and gas exploration. Regeneration on seismic lines in Alberta's boreal forest is limited by slow natural recovery, making them persistent features on the landscape and prompting interest in line restoration through vegetation reestablishment. The goal of this study was to establish an effective woody vegetation sampling method for monitoring seismic line regeneration in boreal mixedwood forests. Data collected in belt transects and circular plots were similar, and doubling the area sampled did not impact the results. Based on ease of implementation, a 30 m x 2 m belt transect in the center of a seismic line is the recommended sampling method. However, if woody understory vegetation is also being measured, dividing the belt transect into smaller areas is recommended as a single belt transect yielded less accurate height data than circular plots. Plots were also measured along seismic lines' edge and inner areas to determine if vegetation recovery differs across the width of the line. While all tree responses did not differ between the plot locations, woody understory vegetation was more abundant when measured along the inner seismic line locations. Therefore, if woody understory recovery is the focus of the sampling program, using plots placed across the seismic line width is recommended to prevent overestimation. These recommendations are intended for measuring woody vegetation recovery on 5 m wide seismic lines in upland mixedwood forests in the boreal forest; implementation in other environments or for other response variables requires additional testing.

AB  - The Xisha Islands constitute the largest coral reef archipelago on the northern margin of the Coral Triangle and are the largest coral reef archipelago among the islands in the South China Sea. This study employed various survey methods including underwater spearfishing, gill netting, handline fishing, longlining fishing, underwater visual surveys, and environmental DNA (eDNA). Additionally, historical data from 1956 to 2023 were reviewed to comprehensively analyze the adaptation characteristics of the fish community structure in the Xisha Islands. The Xisha Islands have documented a total of 874 coral reef fish species, categorized into 27 orders, 102 families, and 337 genera. Of these species, the order Perciformes demonstrated the greatest species richness, which represents 71.05% of the total fish species documented. The structure of coral reef fish communities in the Xisha Islands has undergone significant changes. Firstly, a significant decline in the population of large-sized and carnivorous fish species was observed. The proportion of large-sized fish species diminished by 6.02% (62 species), and the medium-sized fish species saw a reduction of 3.09% (51 species). In contrast, there was a surge of 9.12% in the small-sized fish species population. The carnivorous fish species experienced a decrease of 4.73% (102 species), while an increase was noted in the population of herbivorous and omnivorous fish species. Secondly, the numbers of orders, families, and genera have also significantly decreased, with noticeable declines in the average taxonomic distinctness (Delta +), the variation taxonomic distinctness (Lambda +), functional richness (FRic), and quadratic entropy (RaoQ). Thirdly, the similarity between fish species at different time periods is relatively low. Among different functional groups, large-sized and carnivorous fish species exhibit the lowest similarity, whereas herbivorous fish species exhibit the highest. The turnover of live coral fish species is also evident. Overall, the coral reef fish in the Xisha Islands are showing a trend towards herbivory, miniaturization, and a simplification in species composition and functionality. This study contributes to a better understanding and prediction of the adaptation trends in fish species composition in the Xisha Islands, which is crucial for ensuring the ecosystem services of coral reefs and for the conservation and restoration of ecosystems.

AB  - Natural temperate grasslands in south-eastern Australia are threatened ecological communities that have been massively reduced across their range. Relatively intact examples, however, remain on both public land (e.g., roadsides) and private land (e.g., farmland). In western Victoria, natural temperate grasslands have typically been managed by livestock grazing on farmland and by frequent burning on roadsides. Little attention has been given to how grasslands on farmland and roadsides may each contribute to regional or landscape-scale conservation objectives. Our aim was to compare the plant composition of natural temperate grasslands that have been long-managed with fire with those long-managed primarily by sheep grazing, to explore how land-use history influences plant community structure and its potential implications for conservation planning. We sampled 17 sites in frequently burnt grasslands on roadsides, and 10 sites in historically grazed grasslands on farmland. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination techniques to compare plant community composition between grasslands under these different tenures, and to determine how species richness, cover of different species groups and substrate cover were associated with tenure. We also assessed taxonomic beta diversity to quantify species turnover to enable a detailed comparison of species turnover and compositional consistency between roadside and farmland grasslands. There were marked differences in plant community composition between grasslands on roadsides and farmland. Some grazing-tolerant native forbs and C3 grasses were associated with farmland. High native species richness, grazing-sensitive and taller (> 5 cm tall) forbs, native geophytes, and bare ground cover were associated with roadsides. Taxonomic diversity partitioning showed only slight differences in species turnover between farmland and roadside grasslands. Differences in community composition between natural temperate grasslands on roadsides and farmland are consistent with differences in long-term management practices that drive the vegetation in different directions. We argue that long-grazed grasslands on farmland and long-burnt grasslands on roadsides have complementary values for conservation. Both should be targeted for management, which should recognise their differences in size, shape and connectivity. Future funding and incentives for grassland conservation in south-eastern Australia will require careful balance to ensure investments consider the complementary roles of different types of grassland sites at the landscape scale.

This calls for research on factors that enhance sapling survival and promote recovery of herbivore preferred species. One understudied factor in ungulate dominated boreal forests is the ability of young trees to escape large herbivores by utilising "nurse plants". First, we examined the impact of ungulate browsing on the abundance and size of rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), a functionally important tree species in an old-growth boreal pine forest, western Norway. The responses were compared between exclosures and ungulate-access plots over ten years (2001-2011) combined with investigations along a browsing intensity gradient (Exp. A). In a second experiment we investigated whether rowan saplings escape browsing and enhance growth and survival by growing within nurse plants. Consequently, we planted rowan saplings in ungulate browsing areas, inside and outside coniferous juniper (Juniper communis) bushes, and analysed the treatment effect on browsing, growth, and survival of rowan saplings across five years (2013-2018; Exp B). Excluding large herbivores resulted in a large increase in rowan saplings which were six times more abundant in exclosures (0.44 ind./m(2)) compared to ungulate-access plots (0.07 ind./m(2)) after ten years (Exp. A). The abundance of rowan saplings also decreased with higher browsing intensity. Moreover, the rowans in exclosures grew to almost twice the height of the ungulate-access rowans. The protected rowan saplings experienced significantly less browsing damage, and only 25% of the protected plants experienced heavy browsing or died after the first winter, compared to 70% of the unprotected plants (Exp. B). After five years, 50% more unprotected than protected plants experienced heavy browsing or mortality, and growth in protected plants was nearly 50% greater over the period. The negative impact of ungulate browsing on abundance and growth of rowans can be counteracted by positive plant-plant interactions. Rowan saplings growing within nurse plants showed significantly less browsing and better performance indicating high functional importance of the forest understorey. Forest managed with multi-layered and multi-species understoreys may therefore also be beneficial for tree recruitment in browsed boreal forest landscapes.

AB  - Herbivory can hinder restoration success by limiting the recovery of plant biodiversity. This study investigates whether plant-plant interactions, such as associational defenses, can increase the survival of a palatable species in restoration contexts where herbivory inhibits recovery. Specifically, we investigate the potential of associational defenses by the perennial Nuphar advena (yellow pond-lily) to influence the growth and survival of Zizania aquatica (annual wild rice) in a freshwater tidal marsh restoration where goose herbivory has limited Z. aquatica recovery. Wild rice was planted within exclosures and unfenced control plots located within patches of N. advena or adjacent mudflat. In an additional treatment to test the negative effects of light competition, we planted Z. aquatica in exclosures located within experimental clearings in N. advena patches. We also surveyed grazing pressure on naturally-occurring Z. aquatica within transects that spanned N. advena patches and adjacent mudflat. Based on observational and experimental results, N. advena provided clear protection from grazing for Z. aquatica. However, there was a cost to Z. aquatica growing in N. advena patches- plantings within N. advena had greater mortality and significantly reduced biomass due to low light availability.

AB  - Wildlife management and conservation requires monitoring of species distribution and population indicators, especially when the unbalanced demographic changes of some species can affect the whole ecosystem functioning. The populations of wild boar (Sus scrofa) have, over the past few decades, undergone an expansion around the world, reaching situations of overabundance that can cause serious economic, ecological and health problems. This numerical increase of wild boar and its new spatial invasion can affect certain vulnerable species in sensitive ecological zones, such as the main inland wetland complex in SW Europe.
   In this context, we aim to (i) examine the association of wild boar abundance and that of lagomorphs, and waterbird productivity, controlling the possible effects of wild carnivores and other environmental predictors, and (ii) applying a survey method useful for managers to evaluate expected effect of wild boar abundance.
   Overall, the presence of wild boar has been detected in 80.8% of the monitored wetlands (n = 26), but a high variation of abundance rates was found. Wild boar abundance negatively associated with the productivity of the entire community of waterbirds, a priori highly vulnerable, breeding on shores or islands, both colonially (genus Gelochelidon, Himantopus, Recurvirostra, Sternula, Glareola, Tringa and Phoenicopterus) or solitary (genus Anas, Spatula, Mareca, Charadrius, Vanellus, Anser, Ardea, Aythya, Fulica, Netta, Oxyura and Tadorna).
   In addition, we evidenced a clear negative association of wild boar and wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) population abundance in the monitored wetlands. Rabbits are a keystone species in the study area and represent stable prey for many endangered predators.
   Our results suggest that potential impacts caused by high wild boar abundance may be already reaching unsustainable levels for some wetlands. Inter-species integrated monitoring is key to address the population management plans of wild boar populations in wetlands and to preserve the most vulnerable species.

AB  - Invasive alien species can cause detrimental changes in native ecosystems, but our understanding of the interactions between multiple exotic species is limited. To evaluate the joint effect of multiple sympatric invaders on an ecosystem, we must first understand how they interact with each other.
   Here, we quantified the spatial distribution, dietary composition and overlap of four invasive generalist vespid species (two Vespula and two Polistes) that co-occur on Ahuahu off the north-east coast of New Zealand. We used DNA metabarcoding of larval faecal material to identify prey species, and mapped the locations of nests.
   We observed clear spatial partitioning, with different wasp species aggregating in different habitats. Diet differed both among wasp species (diet partitioning) and among seasons (temporal partitioning). There was stronger competition (highest diet overlap) between Vespula germanica and Vespula vulgaris than between other wasp species, but partitioning resources minimised spatial and diet overlap between the four species.
   Additionally, we obtained high-resolution diet inventories that help assess the combined ecological impact of invasion by multiple wasps. These species consumed mostly native and endemic invertebrates from multiple trophic levels, but particularly herbivores (Lepidoptera). We provide direct evidence that in combination they exploited a wide range of endemic invertebrates.
   Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates resource partitioning among four invasive wasps, facilitating coexistence of these generalist invaders. We conclude that coexistence probably amplifies their ecological impact. Quantifying how multiple invaders exploit and partition resources provides insights into how communities assemble and helps to assess the cumulative effects of multiple invaders on the recipient community.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are an introduced species that affect ecosystems through myriad pathways. They are the target of population control efforts, but one outstanding question is the extent to which native predators affect population demography. Cougars (Puma concolor) are a known predator of wild pigs and cooccur with wild pigs in several regions of the Americas. However, investigations of wild pig survival in regions with cougars are lacking. We investigated the survival and causes of mortality for wild pigs in California, USA where cougars could act as a predator. We also explored habitat selection of wild pigs with respect to cougar predation risk. We collared 69 wild pigs, 15 adults, 15 subadults, and 39 juveniles. Captures occurred in winter and spring and survival estimates primarily reflect spring and summer survival. We estimated 6-month survival of adults and juveniles to be 0.923 (95% confidence interval: 0.789-1.00) and 0.563 (0.416-0.762), respectively, which are similar to estimates from areas without cougars. Only juvenile and one subadult wild pig were killed by cougars, suggesting that cougars are a limited predator of adults. We also investigated feeding locations of 3 GPS-collared cougars to generate a spatial layer of cougar kill occurrence. We used this layer in an integrated step selection function for wild pigs and observed wild pigs selecting areas with low probability of cougar kill occurrence during times when cougars are most active. Combined, these results suggest that cougars are a minor source of mortality for wild pigs during the spring and summer and may be unlikely to provide substantial biological resistance against the spread of wild pigs. Our monitoring occurred when native prey (e.g. ungulate neonates) are most abundant which may influence cougar predation of pigs. It is likely that a preference for native prey, the novelty of wild pigs, wild pig habitat selection, and the potential danger of adult wild pigs reduces cougar predation.

AB  - In an era of global change, historical natural history data can improve our understanding of ecological phenomena, particularly when evaluated with contemporary Indigenous and place-based knowledge. The Yala lambda i (Goose Island) Archipelago is a group of islands in Heiltsuk (Hailaqv) territory on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada. Not only has this region been important to the Heiltsuk for millennia but also it is both a federally and internationally recognized important bird area. In this study, we compare data collected by Charles J. Guiguet, a biologist who documented bird communities at Yala lambda i in the summer of 1948, to three different contemporary surveys and to citizen-science data. We find that the relative abundances of forest bird species (i.e., birds that use the terrestrial island ecosystems) in 1948 differed to those observed in systematic surveys in 2011. While Orange-crowned Warblers, Dark-eyed Juncos, and Red Crossbills comprised 55% of detections by Guiguet in 1948, the three most abundant species in 2011 were Bald Eagles, Varied Thrushes, and Pacific Wrens, and these accounted for only 25% of detections. Although we could not make a quantitative comparison, we provide summaries of each species observed in surveys or reported on eBird. We also incorporate Heiltsuk place-based knowledge to enrich our discussion of the variability in bird communities over time, from how changes in mammal communities and human use may have shaped vegetation dynamics to how large-scale natural phenomena impacted topography. To understand which birds are present and how their communities are changing over time, we recommend continued monitoring of the bird communities at Yala lambda i.

AB  - Biological invasions are a major threat to biodiversity and have particularly devastating impacts on island ecosystems. The New Caledonia archipelago is considered a biodiversity hotspot due to its diverse native flora. Javan rusa deer (Rusa timorensis) were introduced to New Caledonia in 1870 and the population consists of several hundred thousand individuals today. They directly threaten rare endemic species and affect the composition and structure of the vegetation. While a rusa deer management plan has identified ten priority areas for deer control operations, removing deer could be offset by the dispersal of animals back into the control areas. Here, we genotyped 628 rusa deer using 16 microsatellite markers to analyse the genetic structure of the animals in New Caledonia. We aimed to assess fine-scale genetic structure, to identify natural barriers to deer movement and to assess functional connectivity by optimising individual-based landscape resistance models. Our results suggested that rusa deer formed a single genetic population on the main New Caledonian island. The isolation-by-distance pattern suggested that female dispersal was limited, whereas males had larger dispersal distances. We assessed functional connectivity using different genetic distance metrics and all models performed poorly (mR(2) <= 0.0043). Landscape features thus hardly affected deer movement. The characteristics of our results suggested that they were not an artefact of the colonisation history of the species. Achieving an effective reduction of deer population sizes in specific management areas will be difficult because of the deer's high dispersal capabilities and impossible without very substantial financial investment.

AB  - European bison (Bison bonasus) were widespread throughout Europe during the late Pleistocene. However, the contributions of environmental change and humans to their near extinction have never been resolved. Using process-explicit models, fossils and ancient DNA, we disentangle the combinations of threatening processes that drove population declines and regional extinctions of European bison through space and across time. We show that the population size of European bison declined abruptly at the termination of the Pleistocene in response to rapid environmental change, hunting by humans and their interaction. Human activities prevented populations of European bison from rebounding in the Holocene, despite improved environmental conditions. Hunting caused range loss in the north and east of its distribution, while land use change was responsible for losses in the west and south. Advances in hunting technologies from 1500 CE were needed to simulate low abundances observed in 1870 CE. While our findings show that humans were an important driver of the extinction of the European bison in the wild, vast areas of its range vanished during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition because of post-glacial environmental change. These areas of its former range have been climatically unsuitable for millennia and should not be considered in reintroduction efforts.

AB  - Herbivores can affect plant population growth both directly through the damage they inflict to a focal species, and indirectly by moderating conditions for plant recruitment, nutrient cycling, competition and other biotic interactions, for example, through trampling, defecation, and grazing on surrounding vegetation. Still, the relative importance of direct versus indirect effects of herbivores on plant vital rates (establishment, survival, fecundity), size, and population growth rate is poorly known. We quantified direct and indirect effects of ungulate grazers on population growth rate of the short-lived perennial herb Primula farinosa, using integral projection models based on demographic data collected over seven years in exclosures and open control plots in nine grassland populations in southern Sweden. Grazers had negative direct effects on P. farinosa population growth rate, but these were on average more than balanced by positive indirect effects. As predicted, the strength of the direct negative effect tended to increase with grazing intensity. The positive indirect effect was mainly linked to improved conditions for plant recruitment, and was strongest in populations where vegetation height differed most between exclosure and control. Simulations indicated that indirect effects of ungulate grazers on population growth rate via interactions with pollinators, seed predators, and small herbivores were weak. Our study illustrates how both the overall, direct, and indirect effects of grazing on plant population growth rate can be identified and quantified, and thereby provide a more complete understanding of how grazers influence plant fitness, abundance, and distribution. Such insight will be crucial for predictions of the effects of environmental change on population viability and the management of declining species.

AB  - In arid environments, areas of high soil nutrient concentrations are common under woody plants due to ecosystem functions, including faunal deposition. Sociable weavers (Philetairus socius) are birds that build nests on camelthorn (Vachellia erioloba) and shepherd (Boscia albitrunca) trees and their faeces enrich the soil. Nevertheless, the soil under the nests is devoid of vegetation. We evaluated the hypotheses that the presence of trees and weaver nests alters soil properties, which vary with tree species and size as well as nest size, but that the area devoid of vegetation under nest trees is due to physiological drought, lack of viable seeds or nutrient toxicity. We sampled and analysed soil properties under trees with and without a sociable weaver nest and the grassland between them. Soils under trees were characterized by higher N (2.3-fold) and P (1.3-fold) compared to grassland areas. Furthermore, soils under nest-trees had higher N (3.5-fold), and P (4.1-fold) concentrations than soils under trees without nests. Some soil properties also varied with increasing tree and colony size. Soil water infiltration rate decreased under nest-trees with increased colony size, limiting seed germination, despite good seed banks and nutrient-rich soils. This combination of feedbacks establishes these trees as powerful ecosystem engineers.

AB  - Sanitja Island, the northernmost land of the Balearic Islands, is occupied by a population of Lilford's Wall Lizard, Podarcis lilfordi, under extreme environmental conditions. It is an islet of less than 10 hectares, with low plant diversity and a complete absence of shrubs. During long-term monitoring, we studied lizard abundance over a period of approximately 40 years. Throughout several years, a group of domestic goats were introduced into the islet, leading to a collapse of the lizard population, with important collateral effects on their trophic ecology. On Sanitja Island, we observed the only case of a population of P. lilfordi in which the trend of the time series of abundance was significantly negative. The analysis of the time series indicated a lack of effect of the abiotic factors. The only factor that had a detectable effect on the population was the presence of goats. The introduction of goats caused the impoverishment of trophic resources for lizards and the change to a more diverse diet, with significantly lower consumption of plant matter. The removal of goats resulted in a partial recovery of lizard density, the recovery of a more specialized diet and the restoration of foraging behaviour on the dominant vascular plant, the sea fennel Crithmum maritimum. This foraging behaviour allows the pollination syndrome between the sea fennel and P. lilfordi. This study shows the dramatic effect of the introduction of an herbivorous competitor in an insular lizard population.

AB  - Context Assessing the distribution and abundance of marine fauna and the ecological status of coastal and pelagic ecosystems is key to biodiversity conservation, but the monitoring of mobile marine species raises multiple logistical and financial challenges.Aims The project describes the distribution, abundance and taxonomic assemblage of several marine megafauna taxa in three subregions of the western and central South Pacific Ocean (New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna, and French Polynesia).Methods Large-scale aerial surveys were conducted using a standardised multi-taxon protocol, to characterise the occurrence and abundance of marine megafauna over 2.5 million km2. Analysing more than 122 000 km of transects, the densities of 22 different taxa were estimated: seven taxonomic groups of marine mammals (Physeteridae, Kogiidae, Ziphiidae, Globicephalinae, Small Delphininae, Large Delphininae, and Dugongidae), a single group for hard-shelled sea turtles, three groups of elasmobranchs (including whale sharks), and 11 groups of seabirds (including Phaethontidae, Hydrobatidae, Fregatidae and Sulidae).Key results Contrasting patterns of species distribution were found. Marine mammal diversity increases north and west, with a distinct species assemblage in New Caledonia, compared to other subregions. A strong latitudinal gradient was observed across French Polynesia, independent of taxa.Conclusions This study provides the first comparison of marine species assemblages across the three oceanic subregions and sets a regional baseline for the biogeography of marine megafauna in the region.Implications The taxonomic and spatial extension of the results opens up new perspectives for the development of local conservation measures, especially for taxa with already documented population declines.
   This study simultaneously describes the spatial distribution and densities of 22 distinct taxonomic groups of marine mammals, sea turtles, elasmobranchs and seabirds over three large oceanic subregions of the western and central South Pacific Ocean. It demonstrates the value of multi-taxa monitoring applied to aerial surveys of offshore marine megafauna, and provides a baseline for future conservation measures.This article belongs to the Collection Marine Mammals in the Pacific.

AB  - 1. Global biodiversity decline and its cascading effects through trophic interactions pose a severe threat to human society. Establishing the impacts of biodiversity decline requires a more thorough understanding of multi-trophic interactions and, more specifically, the effects that loss of diversity in primary producers has on multi-trophic community assembly.2. Within a synthetic conceptual framework for multi-trophic beta-diversity, we tested a series of hypotheses on neutral and niche- based bottom- up processes in assembling herbivore and carnivore communities in a subtropical forest using linear models, hieratical variance partitioning based on linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) and simulation.3. We found that the observed taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional beta-diversity of both herbivorous caterpillars and carnivorous spiders were signifi-cantly and positively related to tree dissimilarity. Linear models and variance partitioning for LMMs jointly suggested that as a result of bottom- up effects, producer dissimilarities were predominant in structuring consumer dissimilarity, the strength of which highly depended on the trophic dependencies on produc-ers, the diversity facet examined, and data quality. Importantly, linear models for standardized beta-diversities against producer dissimilarities implied a transition between niche- based processes such as environmental filtering and competitive exclusion, which supports the role of bottom- up effect in determining consumer community assembly.4. These findings enrich our mechanistic understanding of the "Diversity Begets Diversity' hypothesis and the complexity of highertrophic community assembly, which is fundamental for sustainable biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management.

AB  - Introduction Terrestrial mammals play a pivotal role in tropical forest ecosystems, representing a rich and functionally diverse component of these biomes. However, they confront formidable threats globally, such as hunting, habitat loss, and fragmentation, amidst the expansion of human-altered landscapes in tropical regions. Understanding the impacts of these changes on mammal communities is crucial for designing effective conservation interventions. Northeast India's tropical forests, a biodiversity hotspot, host a diverse array of mammalian fauna. The primary challenge faced by these species involves anthropogenic activities leading to the shrinkage and fragmentation of forested habitats.Methodology In this study, we conducted systematic camera trapping in Mehao Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS) to assess mammal status and distribution. Employing single-season occupancy models, we evaluated factors influencing mammalian species' detection probability and spatial utilization within the landscape.Results The study documented 27 mammalian species, with 12 identified as "threatened" on the IUCN Red List. Species like clouded leopard, marbled cat, Gongshan muntjac, red goral, Mishmi takin, and sambar were recorded but observed infrequently. Notably, we reported the Asiatic brush-tailed porcupine's first sighting in Mehao. Our findings revealed that undisturbed forest habitats were preferred by all species. Mainland serow dominated most of the sanctuary's area, followed by northern red muntjac, yellow-throated marten, and masked palm civet.Discussion The response of mammalian species to ecological and anthropogenic covariates varied significantly, underscoring the necessity for species-specific management strategies alongside a landscape-scale conservation approach. These outcomes emphasize the urgency of managing and safeguarding rare and elusive mammalian species within and around Mehao WLS.

AB  - Green roofs are often promoted as a mean to counter the negative environmental effects of urbanization on nature and to increase the amount of green space in cities. Green roofs often enhance aboveground biodiversity, especially herbivores and pollinators. However, if and in what way they support belowground biodiversity, and more specifically soil fauna, is rarely studied. Therefore, we evaluated the diversity of a dominant group of soil fauna, Collembola (springtails), on twelve extensive green roofs in three cities in Belgium (Antwerp, Ghent and Hasselt), over a one year period. The roofs differed in height above the ground, surface area, vegetation type, and age, i.e. time since construction. We analysed if these roof characteristics influenced species richness, abundance or diversity of Collembola. In total we found ten species of Collembola. Species richness was not higher on roofs that were larger (habitat area) or closer to the ground (isolation to surrounding soil), indicating that island biogeographic theory is not applicable to species richness in our study system. However, significant differences in the mean number of individuals (abundance) were found between different months. Collembola taxonomical composition also varied between the roofs, but this variation could not be related to any of the measured roof variables. Roof communities were characterised by hemiedaphic life forms, preferring neutral to semi-moist conditions. Apart from the age of the roof that showed a positive significant impact on the abundance of Collembola present, our results suggested that the collembolan fauna showed no significant differences in abundance, species richness or diversity between roofs with different characteristics. However, we suggest that future studies are needed to investigate whether our findings are applicable to other groups of soil-living arthropods.

AB  - Population fluctuations of lemmings in the High Arctic appear to be driven by predator-prey interactions. However, lemming grazing can sometimes have a strong impact on the vegetation during population peaks, suggesting a possible role of plant-herbivore interactions. We use a large-scale experiment where predators were excluded to investigate whether predator reduction could have cascading effects on the vegetation through an increase in lemming densities in the Canadian Arctic. Morphological traits and biomass of Salix arctica and the biomass of Poaceae and Juncaceae were sampled inside and outside lemming exclosures. We detected signs of lemming grazing on the number of buds and catkins of S. arctica at snowmelt, and stem length, stem growth, and number of leaves during the summer but the impact was relatively small. We did not detect an impact of grazing on plant biomass during the summer. We also found limited evidence that the impact of grazing was higher in the predator exclosure even though lemming density increased up to two-fold. Our results suggest that the short-term impact of lemmings on vascular plants is relatively small and that an experimental increase in lemming density did not have a cascading effect on the plants consumed by these herbivores in the Canadian Arctic.

AB  - Imagery has become a key tool for assessing deep-sea megafaunal biodiversity, historically based on physical sampling using fishing gears. Image datasets provide quantitative and repeatable estimates, small-scale spatial patterns and habitat descriptions. However, taxon identification from images is challenging and often relies on morphotypes without considering a taxonomic framework. Taxon identification is particularly challenging in regions where the fauna is poorly known and/or highly diverse. Furthermore, the efficiency of imagery and physical sampling may vary among habitat types. Here, we compared biodiversity metrics (alpha and gamma diversity, composition) based on physical sampling (dredging and trawling) and towed-camera still images (1) along the upper continental slope of Papua New Guinea (sedimented slope with wood-falls, a canyon and cold seeps), and (2) on the outer slopes of the volcanic islands of Mayotte, dominated by hard bottoms. The comparison was done on selected taxa (Pisces, Crustacea, Echinoidea, and Asteroidea), which are good candidates for identification from images. Taxonomic identification ranks obtained for the images varied among these taxa (e.g., family/order for fishes, genus for echinoderms). At these ranks, imagery provided a higher taxonomic richness for hard-bottom and complex habitats, partially explained by the poor performance of trawling on these rough substrates. For the same reason, the gamma diversity of Pisces and Crustacea was also higher from images, but no difference was observed for echinoderms. On soft bottoms, physical sampling provided higher alpha and gamma diversity for fishes and crustaceans, but these differences tended to decrease for crustaceans identified to the species/morphospecies level from images. Physical sampling and imagery were selective against some taxa (e.g., according to size or behavior), therefore providing different facets of biodiversity. In addition, specimens collected at a larger scale facilitated megafauna identification from images. Based on this complementary approach, we propose a robust methodology for image-based faunal identification relying on a taxonomic framework, from collaborative work with taxonomists. An original outcome of this collaborative work is the creation of identification keys dedicated specifically to in situ images and which take into account the state of the taxonomic knowledge for the explored sites.

AB  - Despite its remoteness, the vegetation of Subantarctic Macquarie Island is amongst the most thoroughly surveyed and monitored in Australia. Eradication of invasive European rabbits was achieved in 2011, after a decline in introduced rabbit populations in the eighties and nineties and a resurgence in the early twenty-first century. The impacts of introduced rabbits and climate change on the vegetation of Macquarie Island are well-documented from long-term plots situated in some, but not all, of the vegetation types. Satellite data are sporadic, with substantial could-free coverage rare. The island has been well-photographed over many years, and several series of long-term photo-monitoring sites have been established over the past few decades. We compared insights on vegetation change derived from repeat landscape photography three years after myxoma virus was established, rabbit population resurgence and rabbits eradication, with plant species cover data from a set of long-term monitoring sites, and with spectral vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery covering the transition from high rabbit numbers to no rabbits. The repeat photography confirmed many well-documented vegetation trends, as well as providing an indication of previously unreported trends: stability of Acaena herbfield despite reduced disturbance; increase in cover of Pleurophyllum hookeri; increase in short grassland vegetation; and constancy in cover of Azorella macquariensis. Although subject to errors related to differences in sample size and resolution, the rephotography data gave the best information on spatial and temporal patterns of overall vegetation change. The plot data, where comparable, were not fully consistent with the rephotography data and are expensive to collect, requiring scientific expertise in the field and much time, while the sporadically available remote sensing data were effective in monitoring the revegetation/devegetation of ground and the recovery of Poa foliosa but we were unable to detect other changes.

AB  - Grazing is a crucial anthropogenic disturbance on grasslands. However, it is unknown how livestock grazing affects the relationship between biodiversity and productivity of alpine grasslands in Tibet. We carried out a grazing-manipulated experiment from 2016 to 2019 with grazing intensity levels of null (control, grazing exclusion, C.K.), moderate grazing [1.65 standardized sheep unit (SSU) per hectare, M.G.], and heavy grazing (2.47 SSU per hectare, H.G.) on a typical alpine grassland in the Lhasa River Basin, central Tibet. We measured aboveground biomass (AGB), species assembly (alpha and beta diversity indices), and soil nutrients' availability. The results showed that grazing differently affected plant community in different treatments. Notably, the total dissimilarity value between C.K. and H.G. is 0.334. Grazing decreased the Shannon-Wiener index, increased the Berger-Parker index from 2016 to 2018 significantly, and decreased AGB and total soil nitrogen (STN) significantly. Our results also showed that the grazing affected the relationship between AGB and diversity indices and soil nutrients, including soil organic carbon (SOC) and total soil phosphorus (STP). Specifically, AGB decreased with increasing SOC and STP in all treatments, and heavy grazing changed the positive relationships between AGB, STP, and Shannon-Wiener index to negative correlations significantly compared with grazing exclusion. There was a significant negative correlation between Berger-Parker and Shannon-Wiener indices under each treatment. The general linear models showed that H.G. altered the relationship between diversity and productivity of grassland in central Tibet, and AGB and Shannon-Wiener index positively correlated in C.K. but negatively correlated in H.G. Our study suggests that H.G. caused a negative relationship between plant diversity and productivity. Therefore, sustainable grazing management calls for a need of better understanding the relationship between biodiversity and productivity of alpine grassland in central Tibet.

AB  - Long-term research in grassland biodiversity experiments has provided empirical evidence that ecological and evolutionary processes are intertwined in determining both biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) and biodiversity-stability relationships. Focusing on plant diversity, we hypothesize that multifunctional stability is highest in high-diversity plant communities and that biodiversity-stability relationships increase over time due to a variety of forms of ecological complementarity including the interaction with other biota above and below ground. We introduce the multiple-mechanisms hypothesis of biodiversity-stability - stability relationships suggesting that it is not an individual mechanism that drives long-term biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning and stability but that several intertwined processes produce increasingly positive ecosystem effects. The following six mechanisms are important. Low-diversity plant communities accumulate more plant antagonists over time (1), and use resources less efficiently and have more open, leaky nutrient cycles (2). Conversely, high-diversity plant communities support a greater diversity and activity of beneficial interaction partners across trophic levels (3); diversify in their traits over time and space, within and across species, to optimize temporal (intra- and inter- annual) and spatial complementarity (4), create a more stable microclimate (5), and foster higher top-down control of aboveground and belowground herbivores by predators (6). In line with the observation that different species play unique roles in ecosystems that are dynamic and multifaceted, the particular mechanism contributing most to the higher performance and stability of diverse plant communities might differ across ecosystem functions, years, locations, and environmental change scenarios. This indicates "between-context insurance" or "across-context complementarity" of different mechanisms. We introduce examples of experiments that will be conducted to test our hypotheses and which might inspire additional work.

Some cases of an invasive character of the species have been reported under specific site conditions, but systematic data on the extent of natural regeneration and spread of Douglas fir across different forest communities are largely lacking. Due to its potential tolerance to increasing summer droughts, Douglas fir has been suggested as a sustainable future tree species for Central European forests. In this study, we investigated natural regeneration of Douglas fir in comparison to native tree species in 39 forest stands in Switzerland belonging to different forest communities. We analyzed the regeneration success of Douglas fir, Norway spruce (Picea abies), silver fir (Abies alba), and European beech (Fagus sylvatica) with respect to ecological site conditions. The proportion of Douglas fir seedlings (<130 cm height) was <5% in the majority of stands; but in four stands, Douglas fir was the most abundant species among seedlings. In most other stands, Norway spruce (occurring in 37 stands/ dominant in 10 stands), silver fir (38/2 stands) and beech seedlings (35/10 stands) were more abundant than Douglas fir seedlings. Saplings (>= 130 cm height but <12 cm diameter at breast height) of Douglas fir were observed in five stands with proportions between 10% and 23% and in eight stands with proportions of <10%, in particular in stands with a high proportion of Douglas fir seed trees. Beech saplings occurred in 28 stands and were most abundant in eleven stands. Saplings of silver fir (24/3 stands) and Norway spruce (19/6 stands) were less frequent. The abundance of Douglas fir seedlings correlated positively with the proximity to seed trees and light transmission of the canopy, but negatively with understory vegetation cover and litter abundance. Ungulate browsing did not significantly affect the regeneration of any tree species in the study stands. On the Central Plateau, Douglas fir was mainly planted in productive beech forest communities where it is strongly limited due to its low competitiveness compared to beech and other fast-growing deciduous tree species. On dry and less productive sites, where the canopy is not closed, Douglas fir is able to establish successfully. On such sites, a close monitoring of Douglas fir regeneration and the potential implementation of control measures is recommended.

AB  - Insects make up the bulk of terrestrial diversity and about half of insect species are herbivores that have direct relationships with their host plants and are the basis of the entire food chain, on which wildlife and humanity depend. Some herbivorous insect traits, such as their spatio-temporal distribution, are especially relevant in the current scenario of global changes, which are more pronounced in high elevation areas, helping to improve the effectiveness of conservation actions. Here we evaluated the influence that different spatiotemporal scales have on three free-feeding herbivorous insect guilds (fluid-feeding, leaf-chewing, and xylophagous insects) in montane forest islands immersed in a grassland-dominated matrix (campo rupestre). We assessed whether species turnover or nestedness was the main component determining both spatial and temporal species composition variation (beta-diversity) of the herbivorous insect community. We also checked the temporal effect on herbivorous insect guilds composition between vertical strata. We sampled herbivorous insects during two summers and two winters in 14 forest islands of different sizes and shapes in a natural mountainous fragment located in southeastern Brazil. A total of 6597 herbivorous insects representing 557 morphospecies were sampled, 290 of which were fluid-feeding, 147 leaf-chewing and 120 xylophagous insects. We found a main contribution of time scale in the organization of the herbivorous insect composition sampled in this study, mainly by turnover, with small differences among guilds. Additionally, we could see that climate determined the local variation of species, corroborating that we have a highly variable always-green system over space and time where the understory community varies less in comparison to the canopy community. Our findings suggest that long-term ecological research on herbivorous community structure in relation to climatic variation is a key element for future investigations, which can be decisive for the conservation of herbivorous insect communities. We also suggest that the effects of anthropogenic pressures must be monitored in this system, since these forest islands may serve as warming refuges in a fragmented landscape holding an invaluable diversity of species that, without these old-growth forest reservoirs, would be doomed to disappear.

AB  - Deep-sea environments face increasing pressure from anthropogenic exploitation and climate change, but remain poorly studied. Hence, there is an urgent need to compile quantitative baseline data on faunal assemblages, and improve our understanding of the processes that drive faunal assemblage composition in deep-sea environments. The Southwest Atlantic deep sea is an undersampled region that hosts unique and globally important faunal assemblages. To date, our knowledge of these assemblages has been predominantly based on ex situ analysis of scientific trawl and fisheries bycatch specimens, limiting our ability to characterise faunal assemblages. Incidental sampling and fisheries bycatch data indicate that the Falkland Islands deep sea hosts a diversity of fauna, including vulnerable marine ecosystem (VME) indicator taxa. To increase our knowledge of Southwest Atlantic deep-sea epibenthic megafauna assemblages, benthic imagery, comprising 696 images collected along the upper slope (1070-1880 m) of the Falkland Islands conservation zones (FCZs) in 2014, was annotated, with epibenthic megafauna and substrata recorded. A suite of terrain derivatives were also calculated from GEBCO bathymetry and oceanographic variables extracted from global models. The environmental conditions coincident with annotated image locations were calculated, and multivariate analysis was undertaken using 288 'sample' images to characterize faunal assemblages and discern their environmental drivers. Three main faunal assemblages representing two different sea pen and cup coral assemblages, and an assemblage characterised by sponges and Stylasteridae, were identified. Subvariants driven by varying dominance of sponges, Stylasteridae, and the stony coral, Bathelia candida, were also observed. The fauna observed are consistent with that recorded for the wider southern Patagonian Slope. Several faunal assemblages had attributes of VMEs. Faunal assemblages appear to be influenced by the interaction between topography and the Falkland Current, which, in turn, likely influences substrata and food availability. Our quantitative analyses provide a baseline for the southern Patagonian shelf/slope environment of the FCZs, against which to compare other assemblages and assess environmental drivers and anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - Context. Some populations of introduced species cause significant undesirable impacts but can also act as reservoirs for genetic diversity. Sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) are 'Vulnerable' in their native range and invasive in Australia and New Zealand. Genetic data can be used to determine whether these introduced populations might serve as genetic reservoirs for declining native populations and to identify spatial units for management. Aims. We aimed to identify the provenance of sambar deer in Australia and New Zealand, and to characterise their genetic diversity and population structure. Methods. We used mitochondrial control region sequences and 18 nuclear microsatellite loci of 24 New Zealand and 63 Australian sambar deer collected across continuous habitat in each location. We estimated genetic diversity and population differentiation by using pairwise F-ST, AMOVA, and STRUCTURE analyses. We compared our data with 27 previously published native and invasive range sequences to identify phylogenetic relationships. Key results. Sambar deer in Australia and New Zealand are genetically more similar to those in the west of the native range (South and Central Highlands of India, and Sri Lanka), than to those in the east (eastern India, and throughout Southeast Asia). Nuclear genetic diversity was lower than in the native range; only one mitochondrial haplotype was found in each introduced population. Australian and New Zealand sambar deer were genetically distinct but there was no population structure within either population. Conclusions. The genetic differences we identified between these two introduced populations at putatively neutral loci indicate that there also may be underlying diversity at functional loci. The lack of population genetic structure that we found within introduced populations suggests that individuals within these populations do not experience barriers to dispersal across the areas sampled. Implications. Although genetic diversity is reduced in the introduced range compared with the native range, sambar deer in Australia and New Zealand harbour unique genetic variants that could be used to strengthen genetic diversity in populations under threat in the native range. The apparent high levels of gene flow across the areas we sampled suggest that localised control is unlikely to be effective in Australia and New Zealand.

AB  - Questions: Human activities are increasing the density of domestic grazers and global nutrient loads, modifying the main determinants of vegetation community dynamics. Grazing (top-down control) and nutrient availability (bottom-up control) may interactively modify plant biomass, which is particularly important in grasslands devoted to livestock production. Here, we aim to understand the interactive effects of grazing and fertilization on grassland plant biomass. We hypothesized that the joint effects of nutrient addition and domestic grazing on above-ground plant biomass are not additive, but they modify each other through changes in ground-level light, leaf nutritional quality, above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP), and below-ground plant allocation.
   Location: Flooding Pampa (Buenos Aires, Argentina).
   Methods: We carried out a factorial experiment of grazing exclusion and fertilization with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium + micronutrients during several years in a mesic grassland devoted to livestock production.
   Results: After four years, grazing reduced live above-ground plant biomass by 52%, and when combined with fertilization this reduction was 70%. Nutrient addition in the grazed grassland increased ANPP and leaf nutrient concentration. These changes in turn intensified grazing pressure and cattle's plant consumption. By contrast, fertilization did not produce any significant effect on plant biomass or ANPP inside the exclosures, where ground-level light was low. A structural equation model revealed that the increase in ANPP fostered above-ground and reduced below-ground plant biomass.
   Conclusions: This is the first study conducted in the Pampas grasslands that evaluated the effect of cattle grazing and fertilization on plant communities under field conditions over several years. Grazing and nutrient addition synergistically controlled grassland plant biomass, as the reduction in above-ground biomass by cattle consumption was greater in fertilized plots. Our results provided empirical evidence that leaf nitrogen and ANPP modulated plant biomass dynamics in grasslands devoted to livestock production in the context of increased nutrient loads in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Bird colonies on islands sustain elevated productivity and biomass on adjacent reefs, through nutrient subsidies. However, the implications of this localized enhancement on higher and often more mobile trophic levels (such as sharks and rays) are unclear, as spatial trends in mobile fauna are often poorly captured by traditional underwater visual surveys. Here, we explore whether the presence of seabird colonies is associated with enhanced abundances of sharks and rays on adjacent coral reefs. We used a novel long-range water-landing fixed-wing unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) to survey the distribution and density of sharks, rays and any additional megafauna, on and around tropical coral islands (n = 14) in the Chagos Archipelago Marine Protected Area. We developed a computer-vision algorithm to distinguish greenery (trees and shrubs), sand and sea glitter from visible ocean to yield accurate marine megafauna density estimation. We detected elevated seabird densities over rat-free islands, with the commonest species, sooty tern, reaching densities of 932 +/- 199 per km(-2) while none were observed over former coconut plantation islands. Elasmobranch density around rat-free islands with seabird colonies was 6.7 times higher than around islands without seabird colonies (1.3 +/- 0.63 vs. 0.2 +/- SE 0.1 per km(2)). Our results are evidence that shark and ray distribution is sensitive to natural and localized nutrient subsidies. Correcting for non-sampled regions of images increased estimated elasmobranch density by 14%, and our openly accessible computer vision algorithm makes this correction easy to implement to generate shark and ray and other wildlife densities from any aerial imagery. The water-landing fixed-wing long-range UAV technology used in this study may provide cost effective monitoring opportunities in remote ocean locations.

AB  - (Antilocapra americana) were translocated into the Flint Hills region of Chase County, Kansas, during the late 1970s through the early 1990s as a part of a statewide reintroduction into portions of historical pronghorn range. Since the last translocation in 1992, the Chase County pronghorn population has stabilized at approximately 30 individuals. Several research projects conducted in the 1990s provided important information on the Flint Hills population and local habitat conditions during initial translocations. However, land ownership and land management have changed over time, which may impact pronghorn habitat suitability. Habitat conditions were inventoried in 2021 to determine the current status of pronghorn habitat and potential limiting factors including bottom-wire fence heights, fence density, pasture size, vegetation composition, vegetation height, and coyote occupancy. Maximum bottom-wire height of fences composed of 100% barbed wire was estimated at an average of 41 cm with a minimum average of 30.7 cm, which is below the recommended minimum bottom-wire height of 46 cm. Additionally, only 27.3% of the fences sampled reached a maximum bottom-wire height >= 46 cm, while 100% of minimum bottom-wire heights fell below 46 cm, which suggests a low percentage of fences with adequate bottom-wire height for pronghorn passage. Fence density and pasture size was estimated at 1.8 km/km(2 ) and 2.6 km(2 )respectively. Vegetation height averaged 8.6, 10.0, and 11.1 cm for June, July, and August 2021, which falls below fawn habitat height recommendations (>25 cm) found in the literature. Coyote na & iuml;ve occupancy was determined to be 100% among 9 camera trap sites. We recommend that local landowners (1) raise the minimum average bottom-wire height to 46 cm to improve pronghorn passage and movement across the landscape and (2) maintain an average vegetation height >25 cm during June, July, and August to increase potential fawning habitat.

AB  - Background: The ecological science associated with transitioning exotic forest to native dominance (hereafter transitional forestry, transition forests) is currently limited, yet this form of forest has expanded rapidly. In part, this is related to forest-based carbon credit schemes which have driven large-scale afforestation in exotic trees. In other circumstances (e.g., for soil conservation or values-based reasons such as biodiversity conservation), forest owners wish to transition their exotic forest to native forest without harvest. Knowledge is required to inform management of realistic expectations for regeneration and succession both spatially and temporally. Methods: Mature (>20-year-old) Pinus radiata plantations were surveyed along three elevation-climate gradients in the Waikato region of New Zealand to explore the composition and structure (including native carbon stocks) of plantation understories and whether these parameters vary spatially over several decades. Mammalian browsing was also recorded. Results: Native woody stem densities were variable. Factors indicated as driving variability were stand age, elevation, topographic shelter, soil hydrology, solar radiation, and air temperature. On average, understories comprised five native woody species in the seedling tier, a single native species in the sapling tier, and a single native species in the tree tier. The most common species were the sub-canopy tree species Melicytus ramiflorus, Geniostoma ligustrifolium, and Aristotelia serrata. Tall old-growth species, such as Beilschmiedia tawa, Podocarpus totara, Pectinopitys ferruginea, and Prumnopitys taxifolia, occurred in only particular circumstances and on average at densities too low to form a meaningful part of a future forest canopy. Average species richness was low, although some diversity hotspots occurred. Carbon stocks in native trees and tree ferns in the understories were on average 1.55 +/- 0.38 tCha(-1). Heavy browsing by mammalian herbivores was recorded at 60% of plots. Conclusions: These data indicate typical understorey conditions in mature P. radiata plantations for this area of New Zealand in the absence of management to promote a native transition. These data also highlight the importance of browser control, enrichment planting of tall old-growth species, and canopy manipulations to accelerate regeneration and succession in non-harvest P. radiata plantations. The data suggest transitional forestry should only be attempted at scales that can be reasonably managed, and there is a need for caution against large-scale establishment of P. radiata for transitional forestry as at large scales, achieving adequate levels of management are uncertain.

AB  - Madagascar's biota underwent substantial change following human colonization of the island in the Late Holocene. The timing of human arrival and its role in the extinction of megafauna have received considerable attention. However, the impacts of human activities on regional ecosystems remain poorly studied. Here, we focus on reconstructing changes in the composition of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to evaluate the impact of human land use and climate variability. We conducted a paleoenvironmental study, using a sediment record that spans the last similar to 1,145 years, collected from a lakebed in the Namonte Basin of southwest Madagascar. We examined physical (X-ray fluorescence and stratigraphy) and biotic indicators (pollen, diatoms and micro- and macro-charcoal particles) to infer terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem change. The fossil pollen data indicate that composition of grasslands and dry deciduous forest in the region remained relatively stable during an arid event associated with northward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) between similar to 1,145 and 555 calibrated calendar years before present (cal yr BP). Charcoal particles indicate that widespread fires occurred in the region, resulting from a combination of climate drivers and human agency during the entire span covered by the paleorecord. Following settlement by pastoral communities and the disappearance of endemic megafauna similar to 1,000 cal yr BP, grasslands expanded and the abundance of trees that rely on large animals for seed dispersal gradually declined. A reduction in the abundance of pollen taxa characteristic of dry forest coincided with an abrupt increase in charcoal particles between similar to 230 and 35 cal yr BP, when agro-pastoral communities immigrated into the region. Deforestation and soil erosion, indicated by a relatively rapid sedimentation rate and high K/Zr and Fe/Zr, intensified between 180 and 70 cal yr BP and caused a consequent increase in lake turbidity, resulting in more rapid turnover of the aquatic diatom community. Land use and ongoing climate change have continued to transform local terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems during the last similar to 70 years. The current composition of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems reflects the legacy of extinction of native biota, invasion of exotic species, and diminished use of traditional land management practices.

AB  - Aim: Trophic rewilding is proposed as an approach to tackle biodiversity loss by restoring ecosystem dynamics through the reintroduction of keystone species. Currently, evidence on the ecological consequences of reintroduction programmes is sparse and difficult to generalize. To better understand the ecological consequences of trophic rewilding, we simulated the extinction and reintroduction of large-bodied mammals under different environmental conditions.Location: Europe.Methods: We selected four locations varying in productivity and seasonality in Europe and used a general ecosystem model called Madingley to run simulations. We initialized the model using body mass limits of a European Holocene baseline; we then removed large mammals and let the model converge to a new equilibrium. Next, we reintroduced the previously removed groups to assess whether the equilibrium would shift back to the initial condition. We tested three different reintroduction scenarios, in order to disentangle the importance of the different large mammal groups.Results: The removal of large-bodied mammals led to cascading effects, mainly resulting in increases in smaller-bodied herbivores and the release of mesopredators. Post-reintroduction, the system's new equilibrium state was closer to the initial equilibrium for stable and productive locations compared to highly seasonal and low-productive locations. The maximum trait space volume of the initial state and the post-reintroduction state varied by 9.1% on average over all locations, with an average decrease in trait combinations of 6.6%. The body mass distribution differed by 28%, comparing the initial state to the post-reintroduction state.Main Conclusions: Our simulation results suggest that reintroducing locally extinct large-bodied mammals can broadly restore shifts in ecosystem structure, roughly resembling the baseline ecosystem conditions. However, the extent to which the ecosystem's state resembles the original ecosystem is largely dependent on the reintroduction strategy (only herbivores and omnivores vs. also carnivores) and timing, as well as local environmental conditions.

AB  - At the end of 2020, 18 European bison (Bison bonasus) were introduced to El Encinarejo estate, in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. This hunting-oriented estate has 956 hectares of dehesa, Mediterranean forest and scrubland in which about 400 red deer (Cervus elaphus) and 200 fallow deer (Dama dama) coexist with the bison. To know how trophic resources are used by these herbivore species, faecal samples were collected during the year 2021. The microhistological analysis technique was used to determine the percentage of epidermal fragments of the main functional groups (woody plants, graminoids, legumes and forbs) in each sample. The results showed significant differences between animal species and seasons of the year. Globally, woody plants are preferentially consumed in autumn and winter, graminoids in summer and legumes and forbs in spring. The woody component was the most abundant in the diet of the three species, accounting for 81% of the plant fragments present in red deer faeces, 52% in bison and 38% in fallow deer. This is the first study describing the dietary use of Pistacia lentiscus by European bison, the substantial use throughout all seasons indicates it as a very important diet source. In addition, the interspecific comparison showed that the bison significantly consumed more graminoids (21%), whereas legumes were more present in fallow deer diet (32%). Finally, red deer consumed less forbs than the other two species (8%). It is concluded that there is a certain distribution of trophic resources between the three species that may facilitate their coexistence.

AB  - AimThe late-Quaternary extinctions, which affected primarily large mammals, are strongly connected to the migration of modern humans out of sub-Saharan Africa and tropical Asia (the Palaeotropics), and human hunting remains one of the greatest threats to large mammals globally. Species traits are known to affect vulnerability to human impacts in other (non-megafauna) taxa and so here we conduct an exploratory analysis to test how traits affect the risk of megafaunal species being driven to extinction by humans-both prehistorically in species that are already extinct and currently in species threatened by hunting.LocationGlobal.TimeLate Pleistocene and Holocene, 129-0 kya.Major Taxa StudiedMammals with a body mass >= 9 kg.MethodsWe used phylogenetic logistic regression to analyse the effects of 17 functional, biogeographical, and phylogenetic traits on the incidence of extinction in 544 extinct and extant (196 and 348, respectively) megafauna species.ResultsOur primary finding was that, just as Palaeotropical species experienced a lower incidence of extinction compared to megafauna elsewhere, species on other continents that were more closely related to Palaeotropical species also had lower extinction compared to those more distantly related. We also found support for higher extinction in island endemics, larger-bodied species and plantigrade (flat-footed) species.Main ConclusionsLarger, more insular and plantigrade species were more vulnerable to human impacts due to preferential hunting and/or vulnerability to specific hunting techniques. Older, hominin-driven extinctions in the Palaeotropics (before the Late Pleistocene) may have filtered out species with vulnerable trait combinations, rendering Palaeotropical species and their non-Palaeotropical relatives more resistant to later human impacts. Our finding that several of the same traits influence extinction threat in places where hunting of megafauna is still ubiquitous has implications for the contextualisation of prehistoric megafauna extinctions and for modern conservation and restoration.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are serious threats to biodiversity worldwide. In order to promote animal movement and gene flow between habitat islands, it is important to identify and evaluate the ecological network of species. In Tieli Forestry Bureau (TFB) in Northeast China, we simulated and evaluated the ecological network of roe deer, aiming to provide theoretical support to population conservation. By using three sources of roe deer occurrence data and 15 environmental variables, we simulated the suitability of habitats using the Maximum Entropy Model (MaxEnt). Then, the corridor design model Linkage Mapper was used to identify and evaluate the linkages between habitat cores which are defined by the home range size of roe deer. The results showed that, of the terrain, land cover, vegetation, and anthropogenic interference factors, the anthropogenic interference factors played the most important and complex role in roe deer habitat selection, creating large-area suitable habitats by farming. Two innovative variables of farmland-forest edge length/patch perimeter (FFE:PP) and viewshed introduced in simulation contributed 8.5% and 2.3%, respectively. Surrounded by the unsuitable habitats, the suitable habitats mainly distributed along both sides of the river, covering 41.8% of the total area of TFB. The ecological network of roe deer was composed of 11 habitat cores and 17 linkages. Three linkages connecting the key habitat cores had low quality and linkage suitability ratios, which were probably due to barrier effect of the HeHa expressway intersecting with the linkages. Our study suggests the priority areas for protecting roe deer and the key locations where the wildlife road-crossing structures or animal guidance measures are needed. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The Formica rufa group comprises several ant species which are collectively referred to as "red wood ants" (hereafter RWA). These species have key roles in forest ecosystems, where they are ecologically dominant and greatly influence the dynamics of the habitat they colonise. Various studies have shown how their trophic activity may affect other organisms, which include both other invertebrates and plants. We can therefore hypothesize that their presence could affect the taxonomic and functional composition of epiphytes, despite clear information on such an effect is lacking. This study aimed to fill this research gap by evaluating whether the presence of red wood ants could affect the structure and composition of lichen communities. We selected two sites on the Apennine Mountains in Italy, where the red wood ant F. paralugubris was introduced from the Alps more than 50 years ago. In each site, lichen assemblages on Abies alba trees located within the colonised areas were compared to those from nearby, non-occupied areas. The results allowed for the identification of significant effects of F. paralugubris on the structure of lichen communities. Although there was no detectable impact on lichen species richness, a significant difference in their community composition between colonised and control sites was detected. Furthermore, ant presence seemed to be associated with specific lichen functional traits such as asexual reproduction. We argue that RWA could affect the lichen community either directly, e.g., by actively dispersing the species capable of asexual reproduction through their movements on trees (ant-mediated dispersion), or indirectly through herbivore exclusion. Finally, we also observed differences in beta-diversity among the colonised and non-colonised sites.

AB  - Enhancing resilience in formerly degraded ecosystems is an important goal of restoration ecology. However, evidence for the recovery of resilience and its underlying mechanisms require long-term experiments and comparison with reference ecosystems. We used data from an experimental prairie restoration that featured long-term soil heterogeneity manipulations and data from two long-term experiments located in a comparable remnant (reference) prairie to (1) quantify the recovery of ecosystem functioning (i.e., productivity) relative to remnant prairie, (2) compare the resilience of restored and remnant prairies to a natural drought, and (3) test whether soil heterogeneity enhances resilience of restored prairie. We compared sensitivity and legacy effects between prairie types (remnant and restored) and among four prairie sites that included two remnant prairie sites and prairie restored under homogeneous and heterogeneous soil conditions. We measured sensitivity and resilience as the proportional change in aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) during and following drought (sensitivity and legacy effects, respectively) relative to average ANPP based on 4 pre-drought years (2014-2017). In nondrought years, total ANPP was similar between remnant and restored prairie, but remnant prairie had higher grass productivity and lower forb productivity compared with restored prairie. These ANPP patterns generally persisted during drought. The sensitivity of total ANPP to drought was similar between restored and remnant prairie, but grasses in the restored prairie were more sensitive to drought. Post-drought legacy effects were more positive in the restored prairie, and we attributed this to the more positive and less variable legacy response of forb ANPP in the restored prairie, especially in the heterogeneous soil treatment. Our results suggest that productivity recovers in restored prairie and exhibits similar sensitivity to drought as in remnant prairie. Furthermore, creating heterogeneity promotes forb productivity and enhances restored prairie resilience to drought.

AB  - The historical ecological paradigm of wetland ecosystems emphasized the role of physical or "bottom-up" factors in maintaining functions and services. However, recent studies have shown that the loss of predators in coastal salt marshes can lead to a significant reduction in wetland extent due to overgrazing of vegetation by herbivores. Such studies indicate that consumers or "top-down" factors may play a much larger role in the maintenance of wetland ecosystems than was previously thought. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether altering top-down control by manipulating the presence of predators can lead to measurable changes in salt marsh ecosystem properties. Between May and August of 2015 and 2016, we established exclosure and enclosure cages within three New England coastal wetland areas and manipulated the presence of green crab predators to assess how they and their fiddler and purple marsh crab prey affect changes in ecosystem properties. Predator presence was associated with changes in soil nitrogen and aboveground biomass at two of the three field sites, though the magnitude and direction of these effects varied from site to site. Further, path analysis results indicate that across field sites, a combination of bottom-up and top-down factors influenced changes in measured variables. These results challenge the growing consensus that consumers have strong effects, indicating instead that predator impacts may be highly context-dependent.

AB  - Tree ferns (order Cyatheales) are a key component of wet forests globally, providing critical forest understorey structure and ecosystem functions. Tree ferns may be impacted by ungulates in novel habitats, but the extent and severity of these impacts are often uncertain. We aimed to determine the impact of introduced deer on tree ferns in wet forests of south-eastern Australia. Using both broadscale deer abundance and impact surveys and targeted tree fern assessments, we surveyed browsing impacts on tree ferns at over 200 sites across a range of wet forest types in south-eastern Australia where deer are present. Tree fern species, plant height and estimates of foliage biomass removed by browsing were recorded for over 4500 individual tree ferns including 1871 Cyathea australis, 2622 Dicksonia antarctica and 41 Todea barbara. Browsing impacts on tree ferns were recorded at 96% of surveyed sites, with a third to a half of tree ferns typically impacted by browsing at each site. There were no differences in recorded impact between tree fern species. Browsing of tree ferns was strongly height dependent, regardless of species, and associated with indices of deer density. Tree ferns < 100 cm were often highly impacted (mean > 20% foliage browsed), with impact declining approximately linearly with height to 200 cm, typically low 200 to 300 cm, and absent thereafter. The widespread and in many cases severe browsing on tree ferns recorded can be largely attributable to introduced deer. These impacts potentially threaten tree fern populations and diminish the vegetation structure and ecosystem function of these wet forests. Management interventions to reduce deer populations in the wet forests of south-eastern Australia are critical to protect forest integrity and function.

AB  - Invasive plants threaten biodiversity worldwide, but control of non-native species may affect native species in complex ways. Non-native tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) is widespread in western US riparian environments, and tamarisk beetles (Diorhabda spp.), a tamarisk-specific herbivore, were subsequently introduced as biocontrol. The primary effect of biocontrol is defoliation and branch die-back, with repeated defoliation killing the plant. We investigated the initial stages of site recovery after biocontrol and how tamarisk decline affected birds, their arthropod prey, and microclimate. We compared avian community diversity and composition, arthropod abundance, humidity, and temperature at sites along the Virgin River in Nevada and Arizona, USA characterized as either mixed native vegetation, tamarisk-dominated, or tamarisk-dominated where the majority of tamarisk died from biocontrol. We compared avian communities sampled after biocontrol to counts at the same locations before biocontrol. Prior to biocontrol, community compositions of all but one site grouped together using unbiased clustering algorithms. Following biocontrol, tamarisk-dominated sites grouped separately, and mixed sites grouped with the pre-biocontrol cluster. Comparison of pre- and post-biocontrol communities showed 7 common species declined by >= 30% in dead tamarisk sites, while one species did so at mixed sites and 3 at tamarisk-dominated sites. Individual census points in dead tamarisk had significantly lower Simpson diversity than the same points censused before biocontrol, unless native vegetation was present, suggesting tamarisk death was the cause of dominant species abundance changes. Tamarisk-dominated sites were hotter and drier than sites with native vegetation and supported fewer non-tamarisk-obligate arthropods, consistent with the hypothesis that bird reductions were driven by changes in microclimate and prey abundance. How long these effects last will depend upon the rate of native vegetation recovery after biocontrol, therefore we recommend monitoring sites to determine the trajectory of vegetative recovery and considering the need and feasibility of active restoration in those sites with slow or no native regeneration.

AB  - The South Sandwich Islands (SSI) are a chain of volcanic islands located to the east of the Scotia Sea, approximately 700 km south-east of South Georgia. To date, knowledge of the SSI benthic environment remains limited. In this context, the Blue Belt Programme conducted a scientific survey in the SSI Marine Protected Area (MPA) during February/March 2019 to examine the biodiversity and distribution of benthic communities and their potential vulnerability to licensed longline research fisheries. Here we report results from analysis of multibeam echosounder (MBES) data and drop camera imagery data collected in selected locations around the SSI. A total of eight vulnerable marine ecosystem (VME) indicator morphotaxa were mapped along the slopes of the SSI, showing a substantial variation in taxon composition and frequency of occurrence, both along bathymetric and latitudinal gradients. Our results suggest that VME indicator taxa are mostly restricted to waters shallower than 700 m. As such, based on our present understanding of the region's benthic environment the MPA, as currently established, offers effective protection for the majority of the VME indicator taxa.

AB  - Conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence is believed to be one of the most important mechanisms controlling forest community assembly and species diversity globally. Plant pathogens, and insect and mammalian herbivores, are the most common natural enemy types that have been implicated in this phenomenon, but their general effects at different plant life stages are still unclear. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of studies that involved robust manipulative experiments, using fungicides, insecticides or exclosures, to assess the contributions of different natural enemy types to distance- and density-dependent effects at seed and seedling stages. We found that conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence was more common at the seedling stage. Only 30% of studies showed significant conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence. Among those studies, applying fungicides significantly reduced the effect of conspecific negative distance-dependent mortality. Excluding large mammals reduced the effect of conspecifics, but with only marginal significance (p < 0.1). Our study confirms that plant pathogens have a significant impact on distance-dependent mortality and suggests that the impacts of herbivores on seedlings have been understudied. At the seed stage, large and small mammals, respectively, appear to weaken and enhance negative conspecific distance-dependent mortality. Future research should identify specific agents of mortality, investigate the interactions among different enemy types, and assess how global change may affect natural enemies and thus influence the strength of conspecific distance- and density-dependence.

AB  - Extinctions are predicted to rise by an order of magnitude over the next century. Although contemporary documented extinctions are uncommon, local extirpations likely provide hints about global extinction risks. Comparing responses to global change of locally extinct versus extant species pairs in a phylogenetic framework could highlight why certain species are more vulnerable to extinction than others and which anthropogenic changes are most relevant to their decline. As anthropogenic changes likely interact to affect population declines, demographic studies partitioning the effects of multifactorial stressors are needed but remain rare. I examine demographic responses to nitrogen addition and deer herbivory, two major drivers of species losses in grasslands, in experimental reintroductions of 14 locally extinct and extant confamilial native plants from Michigan prairies. Nitrogen consistently reduces survival, especially in locally extinct species, and growth of locally extinct species benefits less from nitrogen than growth of extant species. Nitrogen reduces population growth rates, largely via reductions in survival. Deer herbivory, meanwhile, had inconsistent effects on vital rates among species and did not affect population growth. Nitrogen and herbivory rarely interacted to affect vital rates. These results link community-level patterns of species loss under nitrogen addition to the population-level processes underlying those losses.

AB  - Ecosystems are frequently considered to be controlled by predation (top-down). Experiments examined this in four bird/spider/grasshopper/prairie habitats over 34 years, employing in each habitat three 100 m2 bird exclosures and controls (121 habitat/year cases) where plant, grasshopper, and spider abundances were measured. Top-down control (plants decrease and grasshoppers increase with bird exclusion) was observed in only 13.2% of cases, while plants increased and grasshoppers decreased in 33.1% of cases, plants decreased and grasshoppers decreased in 25.6% of cases, and plants increased and grasshoppers increased in 28.1% of cases. Therefore, top-down control was not common and system responses were not constant, but varied among sites, years, and directionally over time with climate change. This diversity of responses is expected given the variety of underlying processes in complex ecosystems. For example, decision tree/discriminant analysis found that plant decreases and increases with bird exclusion were correctly identified in 78.3% of cases by grasshopper hatchling abundance, plant cover, and annual net primary production (ANPP), while grasshopper decreases and increases with bird exclusion were correctly identified in 76.7% of cases by edible plant biomass per grasshopper hatchling, grasshopper hatchling abundance, and large grasshopper abundance. Analysis of other system-wide terrestrial trophic experiments indicates that the variety of responses observed by us over time and space may be common so that system-wide trophic responses may, in general, be more variable than either top-down or bottom-up as often considered.

AB  - Cacao is the most important agricultural product in the southern region of Bahia state, Brazil, with 70 % of its production occurring under the traditional agroforestry where cacao is mostly shaded by native trees. This traditional system allows to reconcile the production with the maintenance of the portion of original biodiversity. However, increased deforestation and intensified agroforestry management aimed at boosting productivity may impact the diversity of native species and the services they provide. In this context, our aim was to disentangle the role of landscape forest cover and the local vegetation complexity on predation of caterpillars and herbivory of cacao plants located in agroforestry systems. The study was conducted across 18 cacao agroforest sites in southern Bahia located in landscapes with different amounts of forest cover. We assessed predation rate using dummy caterpillars, sampling understory birds and arthropods and collected leaves of cacao trees to analyze damage by herbivory. We also measured shading levels and the abundance of cacao trees in each agroforestry. Predation pressure on dummy caterpillars was positively influenced by the abundance of total predators and the level of landscape forest cover and negatively by the number of cacao trees. Even so, we found no evidence that landscape, local features or the actual invertebrate assemblages (predators or herbivores) influenced the cacao leaf damage. The findings highlight the multifaceted interactions between ecological factors, predation pressure, and leaf damage within cacao agroforestry systems.

AB  - Introduction The relationship between ectoparasitic flies and bats is influenced by anthropogenic changes in natural environments. In the Amazon, various forms of disturbance contribute to ecosystem imbalance, potentially leading to the local extinction and disruption of ecological functions. Cacao cultivation has been expanding in the Amazon, but studies on its impacts on bat diversity are still limited, hindering the development of effective conservation strategies. This study aims to assess bat and batfly species to understand how land-use changes affect antagonistic interaction networks between ectoparasitic flies and Phyllostomidae bats.Methods We sampled urban areas, natural vegetation, and cacao plantations using 10 mist nets over 69 nights at 36 sites across 10 municipalities in Par & aacute;.Results The overall interaction network showed 42 host species and 52 ectoparasite species, showing high specialization, low connectivity, and insignificant nesting and parasite vulnerability. The highest ectoparasites richness was observed in natural vegetation (47), followed by cacao (30) and urban areas (29). The cacao-dominated network exhibited high modularity, natural areas had the highest occurrence of infracommunities, followed by urban areas and cocoa. Five bat species were present in all three environments, each infested with infracommunities. Notably, infracommunal associations were common among ectoparasite genera Speiseria, Strebla, and Trichobius.Discussion The species richness observed highlights Par & aacute; as a region of exceptional diversity for dipteran ectoparasites of bats (with 60 species). Our study suggests that cacao plantations can serve as suitable habitats for both bats and flies. Notably, we conducted this research on a small, family-run farm. While these types of farms are not substitutes for natural vegetation, they may help mitigate the impacts of rapid land-use and land-cover change. In fact, these small, family-operated farms demonstrated habitat suitability close to that of natural vegetation areas, supporting greater biodiversity within agricultural landscapes.

AB  - In his classical contributions, Olavi Kalela proposed that, due to the low primary productivity of the tundra, Norwegian lemmings are locked in a strong interaction with their winter forage plants. Proposedly, Norwegian lemmings respond to the threat of critical resource depletion by conducting long-range migrations at their population peaks. A tacit premise of this conjecture is that predation pressure on the Fennoscandian tundra is too weak to prevent runaway increases of lemming populations, creating violent boom-crash dynamics. Our results on the dynamics of Norwegian lemmings on the Finnmarksvidda tundra during 1977-2017 are in line with the predictions of Kalela's hypothesis. In contrast to the Siberian and North American tundra, densities of avian predators in our study area have been low even during lemming years, and efficient ones have been lacking from lemming habitats. Lemmings have thus increased unhinged in peak summers and crashed to densities below the trappability threshold during post-peak winters. Each lemming crash has been accompanied by massive habitat destruction. Indications of predator activity have been concentrated to productive shrublands, where lemmings have never reached high densities. Young lemmings have responded to high densities by becoming extremely mobile: they have been trapped in large numbers on islands, including a small island in the middle of Ie & scaron;j & aacute;vri, a 10 x 8 km tundra lake. Many lemmings have been seen swimming across the lake, and many drowned lemmings have been observed. The dynamics and behavior of Norwegian lemmings recorded by us differ radically from those of other Lemmus spp., indicating that cycles generated by lemming-vegetation interactions have two alternative states - one with and the other without intense summer predation. We propose that the cycles of Norwegian lemmings shifted to the latter state during their unique evolutionary history, when they survived the Last Glacial Maximum in a tiny refugium archipelago.

AB  - Background and Aims Mammals and molluscs (MaM) are abundant herbivores of tree seeds and seedlings, but how the trees and their environment affect MaM herbivory has been little studied. MaM tend to move much larger distances during the feeding stage than the more frequently studied insect herbivores. We hypothesize that MaM (1) select and stay within the patches that promise to be relatively the richest in seeds and seedlings, i.e. patches around adult trees that are old and within a distantly related, less productive neighborhood; and (2) try to remain sheltered from predators while foraging, i.e. mammals remain close to adult trees or to cover by herbs while foraging, and might force their mollusc prey to show the opposite distribution.
   Methods We exposed oak acorns and seedlings in a temperate forest along transects from adult conspecifics in different neighbourhoods. We followed acorn removal and leaf herbivory. We used exclusion experiments to separate acorn removal by ungulates vs. rodents and leaf herbivory by insects vs. molluscs. We measured the size of the closest conspecific adult tree, its phylogenetic isolation from the neighbourhood and the herbaceous ground cover.
   Key Results Consistent with our hypothesis, rodents removed seeds around adult trees surrounded by phylogenetically distant trees and by a dense herb cover. Molluscs grazed seedlings surrounding large conspecific adults and where herb cover is scarce. Contrary to our hypothesis, the impact of MaM did not change from 1 to 5 m distance from adult trees.
   Conclusions We suggest that foraging decisions of MaM repulse seedlings from old adults, and mediate the negative effects of herbaceous vegetation on tree recruitment. Also, an increase in mammalian seed predation might prevent trees from establishing in the niches of phylogenetically distantly related species, contrary to what is known from insect enemies.

AB  - 1.Invasive species are reducing global biodiversity. The Llgaay gwii sdiihlda-Restoring Balance project was initiated to halt and reverse biodiversity loss on six islands on Haida Gwaii, Canada through the eradication of invasive Sitka Black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis).
   2.Invasive deer were killed using various hunting methods including bait station, boat, aerial and indicator dog hunting as well as a combination of bailing dogs with boat and aerial hunting. Cost was quantified in terms of helicopter hunting hours (1965 CAD/hr at the time of the study) to facilitate comparisons. Efficiency was quantified as the expected number of deer per helicopter hour.
   3.Hierarchical Bayesian integrated removal models were used to estimate the change in efficiency of the various hunting methods with deer density based on a power function. The models used the number of scent trail detections by dogs at the end of the study to help parameterise the population density.
   4.At densities between 2 and 30 deer/km(2), boat hunting was estimated as the most efficient method while at lower densities indicator dog hunting was most efficient.
   5.The eradication was incomplete. The estimated cost to completion using indicator dog hunting for each island was 43 helicopter hours (similar to$84,000) on Ramsay Island (95% CI = 19-128), 3.9 helicopter hours on Murchison Island (95% CI = 0.56-18) and no additional hours on House (95% CI = 0-1.6) though the selected method would likely have been indicator dogs with combined hunting due to the variable terrain.
   6.Lessons learned: DNA connectivity analysis can be used to determine project durability, pilot studies to confirm method efficiency in local context will increase the chances of success, local knowledge improves efficiency of hunting methods, population and efficiency estimates should be updated throughout operations to allow adaptive management, eradications on ungulates can include pauses to facilitate adaptive management, the level of certainty for determining eradication completion should be determined in advance of operations with explicit trade-offs identified for managers.

AB  - In many areas of the boreal forests and temperate mountains of Canada, resource extraction activities have created forage conditions that are favourable to the growth of moose (Alces alces) populations. In turn, these increased moose populations buoy the abundance of wolves (Canis lupus), which then have negative impacts on caribou (Rangifer tarandus) populations. Consequently, caribou have been declining where increased resource extraction, moose, and wolves occur. To abate unsustainable predation pressure on caribou by wolves, the moose hunting quota was expanded for 17 years to reduce and then stabilize the moose population in the Revelstoke Valley, British Columbia, Canada. However, a reduction in forestry activity paired with habitat protections slowed the early seral conditions that favour moose. Consequently, both hunter-caused mortality and habitat loss may have been contributing to observed moose declines that occurred during this period. Within this changing regulatory and biophysical landscape, we sought to address two research objectives. First, we evaluated how increasing the moose hunting quota influenced the total yield of harvested animals. We expected that density-dependent responses by the moose population would bolster the number of harvestable animals on the landscape. Second, we tested how different forest harvest scenarios might influence moose habitat, wolf densities, and thus caribou population growth rates into future decades. We used data from moose GPS collars (39 individuals), eight aerial population surveys, hunter harvest statistics, estimates of carrying capacity thresholds, and forest harvest records. The latter data series spanned 1961-2020 and informed the resource selection function and calculations for our first research objective as well as the predictive modelling for our second research objective. Between 2003 and 2020, we found that the habitat amounts for moose declined by 44.8%. There were 42% more moose harvested under increased moose hunting quotas than were projected to be harvested under a simulated status quo quota. As the moose population declined and stabilized, we observed higher recruitment rates (e.g. calf:cow ratios) that further contributed to the number of harvested moose. Our simulations indicated that the only forest harvesting scenario where moose carrying capacity would be low enough to stabilize caribou population growth rates by 2040 was to cease forest harvesting entirely in 2020. Practical implication: an increased observed moose harvest quota mitigated the negative effects of forestry on caribou, aided in caribou recovery, and struck a balance that also provided food security and recreational opportunities for moose harvesters.

AB  - The moose ( Alces alces L.), a common large herbivore in the boreal region, impairs forest regeneration by browsing on tree seedlings and saplings. Moose prefer deciduous species, but during winter more coniferous seedlings are used. We used meta-analyses, separately for deciduous and coniferous seedlings, for evaluating whether excluding moose browsing affected seedling density and height. In addition, we compared (1) deciduous seedling proportion, (2) stand density, (3) elapsed time from fencing and (4) estimated moose density with moose exclusion effect sizes. Fencing had a positive effect on coniferous seedling height. With more deciduous trees in a seedling stand, the fencing effect for both seedling height and density of coniferous seedlings decreased. On the other hand, the fencing effects increased with denser stands. At some point effect sizes turned to negative, and conifer species varied in their response to browsing. This implies that deciduous seedlings can protect conifers from browsing by moose up to some mixing ratio, but when deciduous seedling densities are too high, their negative effect increases, presumably through increased competition. Our results suggest that a moderate deciduous admixture in conifer-dominated mixed seedling stands can decrease moose damage but also underline the significance of timely silvicultural measures to minimize the negative effects of excessive deciduous seedlings and too dense stands. Due to differences in coniferous and deciduous species, as well as their compositions and amounts in studied experiments, more studies adjusted to local conditions are still needed to give exact measures for silvicultural recommendations.

AB  - Shallow water seascapes are complex systems, important for the life history and connectivity of many marine fish species. Remote Underwater Video cameras (RUVs) are an increasingly used, non-lethal technique able to record the occurrence of reef fish species with little disturbance. In this study, RUVs were installed in a Marine Protected Area (Cha & ntilde;aral Island, northern Chile, 29 degrees 2'S, 71 degrees 34'W) at three different depth strata (5, 10, 15 m) in three different habitats (sand and boulder, bedrock, and kelp forest) during October 2018, July 2021 and October 2021. The RUV system recorded a total of 20 species belonging to 16 families over 73.5 h of videotaping. The most recurrent fishes were damselfish Chromis crusma, Chilean sandperch Pinguipes chilensis, and marblefish Aplodactylus punctatus. There was a significant difference in fish assemblage composition among depth strata and seasons, but not among habitats. In July 2021 (austral winter) higher densities of small cryptobenthic fish (Helcogrammoides spp.) and medium-sized carnivorous Chirodactylus variegatus were detected, whereas P. chilensis was associated to the deeper stratum, and the herbivorous blenny Scartichthys viridis was related to the shallower depths, which is likely due to differences in the habitat structure and composition. Winter 2021 showed a higher species richness than in spring 2018, while the evenness (Pielou's J') was significantly higher in spring 2018 than winter/spring 2021. There was no other strong or consistent pattern, which suggests that most fish species use the entire depth gradient throughout the year. Finally, the results suggest that the use of RUVs for the estimation of biodiversity of rocky reef fishes is a cost-effective way to improve our understanding of nearshore community shifts in relation to environmental forcing.

AB  - Animals and fungi have long played an overlooked, yet critical, role in the process of ecological succession, which is a foundational theory underpinning the practice of ecological restoration. Restoration efforts often employ three main strategies to manipulate succession, which we can broadly label as: "jumping the line" "resetting" and "removing barriers." Despite their potential impact, current applications of animals and fungi to manipulate succession in restoration efforts have been limited. Examples of their current use include the use of mycelial networks to enhance nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems and bison reintroduction to restore grasslands. However, wide-ranging implementation of taxonomically holistic restoration practices faces various impediments, including logistical challenges, financial constraints, and lack of specialized knowledge. Nevertheless, paradigm shifts toward more inclusive restoration practices that leverage diverse taxa will increase both ecosystem and individual species' resilience, which is especially relevant in the face of the climate and biodiversity crises.

AB  - The ongoing loss of red-listed coastal heathlands is a threat to biodiversity and cultural heritage legacies throughout the Atlantic coastal regions of Europe. It is possible to restore degraded and afforested heathlands, but restoration interventions are often labour-intensive and costly, and the outcome of specific restoration actions are not well documented. We assess the efficiency of restoring coastal heathlands through natural succession (i.e. 'passive restoration') after removal of Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. plantations. The study was replicated on two neighbouring islands in a nature reserve in Western Norway. Low-intensity free-range sheep grazing was implemented as part of the reserve management plan. Furthermore, we tested the effect of leaving the clear-felled woody material as chips on site, this being a cost-efficient strategy on islands. Succession was monitored 1, 2, 4/5 and 8 years after clear-felling, and revegetation of vascular plants and bryophytes was compared to target heathland vegetation. Surprisingly, we found different successional trajectories on the two islands. Species composition on one island approached target heathland vegetation during succession, but not on the other. Wood chips reduced species richness and slowed the restoration process, but these negative effects were only short-term (<8 years). Differences in seed bank composition and soil conditions due to land use may explain the deviating successional trajectories on the two islands. We also found that management actions beyond clear-felling and introducing sheep grazing are necessary due to the rapid seed regeneration of the Sitka spruce.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that humans shape the ecology and evolution of species interactions. Islands are particularly susceptible to anthropogenic disturbance due to the fragility of their ecosystems; however, we know little about the susceptibility of species interactions to urbanization on islands. To address this gap, we studied how the earliest stages of urban development affect interactions between Darwin's finches and its key food resource, Tribulus cistoides, in three towns on the Galapagos Islands. We measured variation in mericarp predation rates, mericarp morphology, and finch community composition using population surveys, experimental manipulations, and finch observations conducted in habitats within and outside of each town. We found that both seed and mericarp removal rates were higher in towns than natural habitats. We also found that selection on mericarp size and defense differed between habitats in the survey and experimental populations and that towns supported smaller and less diverse finch communities than natural habitats. Together, our results suggest that even moderate levels of urbanization can alter ecological interactions between Darwin's finches and T. cistoides, leading to modified natural selection on T. cistoides populations. Our study demonstrates that trophic interactions on islands may be susceptible to the anthropogenic disturbance associated with urbanization. Despite containing the highest diversity in the world, studies of urbanization are lacking from the tropics. Our study identified signatures of urbanization on species interactions in a tropical island ecosystem and suggests that changes to the ecology of species interactions has the potential to alter evolution in urban environments.

AB  - Livestock summer grazing in mountains and forests in Norway is generally considered beneficial to biodiversity. In this study we investigated if this is the case for cattle in boreal production forest. We collected biodiversity data on field layer vegetation, floral resources and flower-visiting insects in young spruce plantations that were planted 2-10 years ago. We picked young spruce plantations inside and outside well-established cattle grazing areas. On each plantation, we sampled fenced and unfenced plots (20 * 20 m each). This study design allowed us to investigate long-term effects of cattle grazing as well as short-term effects of excluding cervids only and shortterm effects of excluding cervids and cattle. Long-term cattle grazing reduced the abundance of woody plants and reduced the abundance of flowers. Excluding cervids for two summers led to reduced height of woody plants (shrubs and heather) and to increased flower abundance. In contrast, excluding cervids and cattle for two summers led to increased height of graminoids, herbs and woody plants, to higher abundance of graminoids, higher flower abundance and higher abundance of flower-visiting insects. In conclusion, cattle affected the studied system in different ways and to a larger extent than native cervids. Our study shows that we must be careful when inferring results from cattle grazing studies on grasslands to forest ecosystems. As this study documents a negative effect of cattle on floral resources and flower-visiting insects, and we currently are facing a global pollination crisis, a careful consideration of the current practice of cattle grazing in boreal forest might be needed.

AB  - The reintroduction of extirpated species is a frequent tactic in rewilding projects because of the functional role species play in maintaining ecosystem health. Despite their potential to benefit both ecosystems and society, however, most well-known species reintroductions have adopted an eco-centric, "nature-in-people-out" approach. Rewilding theory and practitioners acknowledge that ignoring the role Indigenous people did and might once again play in shaping the distribution, abundance, movements, behavior, and health of wild species and ecosystems, is limiting. In this case study, we describe the technical steps we took and how Indigenous knowledge, ceremony, and cultural monitoring were woven into the recent reintroduction of plains bison to Canada's Banff National Park. Six years later, the reintroduced bison herd has grown from 16 to >100 animals, ranges mostly within 30 km of the release site, and, if current growth continues, will likely be managed with Indigenous harvesting. Transboundary bison policy differences are shifting and may lead to bison being more sustainable. The ecocultural approach, therefore, has increased the resilience of our rewilding project.

AB  - Agroecological farming uses crop and non-crop plant biodiversity to promote beneficial insects supplying pollination and biocontrol services to crops. Non-crop plants (sown or weeds) are integral to supporting these beneficial insect species interactions. How the uplift of biotic complexity by agroecological management (crop diversification, ecological infrastructure) influences mutualistic and antagonistic insect interactions regulating the reproduction of non-crop plants remains less understood. Using a pesticide-free farm-scale (125 ha) agroecological experiment, we tested how the individual reproduction of pollinator-dependent, non-crop plant species with different flowering phenology (Cyanus segetum, Centaurea jacea) and their mutualistic (pollinator) and antagonistic (seed herbivore-parasitoid) insect interactions were affected by agroecological practices. Seed set and species interactions of replicate C. segetum and C. jacea randomly introduced to field margins were correlated with floral resource heterogeneity at focal plant (e.g. flower display size), local community (floral richness/abundance driven by sown wildflower or grass margins) and local landscape (crop diversification, area of semi-natural habitat or mass flowering crops) scales. At the seasonal peak of non-crop floral diversity and abundance, antagonistic interactions weakly regulated C. segetum seed set with gains from pollinator activity predominating. Conversely, C. jacea, which flowered past the peak of non-crop floral diversity/abundance, benefited from the promotion of seed herbivore parasitism and pollinator activity by the local landscape cover of semi-natural habitat and mass flowering crops. Synthesis and applications. Agroecological management produced spatial and temporal gradients in crop and non-crop floral resources that interacted to modify pollinator or seed herbivore-parasitoid interactions and Cyanus segetum and Centaurea jacea seed set. The degree of phenological overlap between C. segetum and C. jacea flowering and floral resources in the local community or landscape dictated the type and level of exposure to insect interactions influencing reproduction. Design of agroecological practices to deliver pollination and biocontrol services must consider how effects will vary with species traits and the mutualistic (pollination) and antagonistic (herbivory, parasitism) interactions governing non-crop plant reproduction. Agroecological management supporting beneficial insect interactions may feedback to help restore functional non-crop plant populations and associated biodiversity, potentially reducing the frequency of management interventions (e.g. re-sowing wildflower strips).

AB  - This study explores the composition and structure of species communities associated with the native Azorean tree species Laurus azorica (Seub) Franco (Magnoliophyta, Magnoliopsida, Laurales, Lauraceae). Communities were sampled in six Islands covering the occidental (Flores), central (Faial, Pico, Terceira) and eastern (Sao Miguel, Santa Maria) groups of Azores Archipelago during the BALA project, using standardised sampling protocols for surveying canopy arthropod fauna. In addition, the study characterises the distribution of species regarding their colonisation status and feeding modes and, finally, compares communities of different Islands. Ninety-four arthropod species totalling 10,313 specimens were collected on L. azorica. The Arthropod community was dominated by Hemiptera species, most of them being herbivores. Endemic and native species showed a very high abundance representing (c) Tsafack N et al.

However, despite introduced species being represented by few individuals (6% of the total abundance), their diversity was remarkable (28 species and no significant difference with diversity found in endemic and native species communities). Analysis of rarity patterns revealed a stable community of endemic species (alpha gambin SAD model approaching a log-normal shape), intermediate stable community of native species (alpha SAD gambin model approaching a poisson log-normal) and a less stable community of introduced species (alpha SAD gambin model approaching a log-series shape). A dissimilarity analysis revealed high similarity between communities of Terceira and Pico and high dissimilarity between Flores and Faial communities. We observed a clear individualisation of the different islands when considering endemic species, whereas we observed high overlap when considering native and introduced species groups. Canopy community distribution confirms the results obtained in a previous study which suggest the stability of native and endemic arthropods species communities over introduced species community in native forests fragments. Arthropod species were richer than bryophytes, lichens and vascular plants species. We found that L. azorica serve as the substrate for very few vascular plants species (four epiphytes species), which were present in all Islands, except Elaphoglossum semicylindricum, which does not occur in Santa Maria. L. azorica shelters a significant number of bryophytes and lichens species. Thirty-two lichens and 92 bryophyte species, including 57 liverworts and 35 mosses, are referred to this phorophyte. Five bryophyte species, all Azorean endemics, are considered Endangered by IUCN Criteria. L. azorica harbours a poor community of epiphyte vascular plant species and all of them were ferns, but the community of bryophytes and lichens are not negligible although very low compared to the community found on other previously studied Azorean trees, the Azorean cedar Juniperus brevifolia. The present study shows that most islands present particular species distribution patterns without geographical correlation and that conservation programmes should be adapted to each Island. The study, therefore, calls for a specialisation of conservation programmes for each of the Islands.

AB  - Although an important part of the ecosystem, large wild herbivores (LWH), especially red deer (Cervus elaphus L.), cause significant damage to economically valuable timber in forests of Central Europe. Recent work has demonstrated that less valuable softwood broadleaved trees can act as "biological control" that helps reduce bark browsing on more valuable trees in a mixed stand. To better understand the factors that influence how much bark area and mass are removed by LWH from these broadleaved trees, we took advantage of a novel "natural" experiment that occurred after a breach in a herbivory exclosure surrounding a 10-year old mixed broadleaved/conifer stand in the Western Carpathians in north-western Slovakia. We measured the area of old (up to 2 years previously) and new browsed patches on stems of common aspen (Populus tremula L.), common rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.) and goat willow (Salix caprea L.), and their position along the vertical profile of the stem. The browsed bark area (cm(2)) was then converted to the bark mass (g) removed and the proportion of browsed bark to total bark (%) using conversion equations. Our models demonstrated that the amount of bark removed was influenced by tree species, stem diameter, age of browsing (old vs. new), and stem section along the vertical profile. LWH removed the most bark area from willow but the most bark mass from aspen because aspen had thicker bark than the other tree species. Bark browsing was greater on trees > 6 cm basal diameter. The distribution of bark browsing along the vertical profile was symmetrical (unimodal) with maximum intensity at 101-125 cm from the ground, which corresponds with the height most optimal for feeding by red deer. However, previous browsing in 2019 and 2020 caused new browsing on willow in 2021 to be focused in stem sections lower (51-75 cm) and higher (126-150 cm) than that optima. By quantifying browsing patterns and the amount of bark that is accessible to LWH for forage on the most attractive softwood broadleaved trees, our work will contribute to developing better methods for protecting commercially important species such as European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) in areas of Central Europe that are greatly affected by increasing population density of LWH, especially red deer.

AB  - Ecological succession (sequential replacement of species following a disruptive event) is critical for understanding ecosystem dynamics. With coral reefs facing increasing threats, comprehending secondary ecological succession is of heightened importance. Coral reef restoration, through techniques such as coral transplantation and herbivore introduction, plays a crucial role in mitigating coral degradation at the local scale. However, the combined effect of these two techniques on ecological succession remains understudied. To determine the impact of herbivory and coral transplantation on ecological succession, four experimental conditions were evaluated on reef patches (Bora Bora, French Polynesia): (i) no-restored control, (ii) restored control, and two conditions with herbivorous invertebrates introduced (sea-urchins and mollusks) alongside restoration: (iii) one site with macroalgae removal and (iv) one without. Macroalgae cover and fish were monitored among the conditions over a 70-day period. Herbivorous invertebrates limited algae cover compared to control. However, no difference in fish assemblages was found in alpha diversity when comparing conditions over time. Changes in fish assemblages were observed in beta diversity, with statistically supported values for juveniles in the restored condition with herbivorous invertebrates present. Understanding the dynamics of ecological succession in so complex environments like coral reefs is essential for designing effective restoration strategies and safeguarding their health.

AB  - Aquatic macrophytes, especially Vallisneria nana, provide essential spawning habitat and food resources for the threatened Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri). The availability of V. nana for lungfish has been dramatically reduced in some areas due to flood disturbances and macrophyte recovery is inhibited by reduced hydrochory due to river fragmentation by dams. Active transplanting of macrophytes may be a feasible restoration strategy to increase abundance of macrophytes, however, in the presence of macro-herbivorous aquatic animals, replanted beds may not persist due to intensive grazing. In this study, we analyzed the effects of environmental conditions on growth and expansion of transplanted V. nana in six 60 m2 herbivore exclosures in the mid-Brisbane River in subtropical south-east Queensland. Following establishment, we also quantified the impact of aquatic herbivores on different patch sizes (15 m2 or 45 m2) of restored V. nana to test the hypothesis that larger patch sizes may confer greater resistance to grazing using a paired control/treatment design. After initial planting, V. nana grew and spread rapidly throughout the exclosure plots, with mean % cover increasing from 5% to 71% on average and mean leaf length increasing from 20 cm to 54 cm on average over 161 days. Transplanted V. nana cover was significantly positively associated with water depth and finer substrate sizes and leaf length was significantly positively associated with water depth and water velocity but was unrelated to substrate size. Exposure to grazing significantly reduced cover of V. nana, however there was no significant effects of macrophyte patch size, grazing intensity, or environmental factors on changes in V. nana cover. Complete removal of exclosure fencing resulted in near complete loss of macrophytes within 7-22 days at all plots, indicating the macrophyte beds (15 m2-60 m2) were of insufficient size to resist grazing pressure. Our findings suggest that transplanting is a viable restoration method with exclusion of grazing, which is critical for creating resistant beds to disturbances and driving future macrophyte recovery. Further research is required to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of alternative macrophyte restoration strategies in rivers to foster hydrochory and natural regeneration processes following flood disturbance.

AB  - Reintroduction of species should be based on ecological knowledge, which is fundamental to enhancing the probability of success, but also in predicting the response to future changing landscapes. The addax (Addax nasomaculatus), an endangered antelope whose ecology is mostly unknown, was released in a fenced area of the Jbil National Park, Tunisia. Considering the extreme desert conditions of the area, seasonal changes should affect both habitat and diet selection. Addax occurrence, habitat selection and diet were assessed using an integrative approach, and analysed with multivariate statistics. During the wet season, preferred and avoided plant species abundance were highly correlated with addax occurrence; while in the dry season, preferred plant species abundance were positively correlated with addax presence. Micro-histological analysis of faecal samples indicated differences in diet between seasons. The integrative approach proposed represents a useful contribution for decision-making in the scope of reintroduction programmes and habitat restoration measures, by facilitating the assessment of habitat suitability for endangered antelopes in arid environments.

AB  - We tested the response of algal epifauna to the direct effects of predation and the indirect consequences of habitat change due to grazing and nutrient supply through upwelling using an abundant intertidal rhodophyte, Gelidium pristoides. We ran a mid-shore field experiment at four sites (two upwelling sites interspersed with two non-upwelling sites) along 450 km of the south coast of South Africa. The experiment was started in June 2014 and ran until June 2015. Four treatments (predator exclusion, grazer exclusion, control, and procedural control) set out in a block design (n = 5) were monitored monthly for algal cover for the first 6 months and every 2 months for the last 6 months. Epifaunal abundance, species composition, algal cover, and algal architectural complexity (measured using fractal geometry) were assessed after 12 months. Predation had no significant effect on epifaunal abundances, while upwelling interacted with treatment. Grazing reduced the architectural complexity of algae, with increased fractal dimensions in the absence of grazers, and also reduced algal cover at all sites, though the latter effect was only significant for upwelling sites. Epifaunal community composition was not significantly affected by the presence of herbivores or predators but differed among sites independently of upwelling; sites were more similar to nearby sites than those farther away. In contrast, total epifaunal abundance was significantly affected by grazing, when normalized to algal cover. Grazing reduced the cover of algae; thus, epifaunal abundances were not affected by the direct top-down effects of predation but did respond to the indirect effects of grazing on habitat availability and quality. Our results indicate that epifaunal communities can be strongly influenced by the indirect consequences of biotic interactions.

AB  - Insect herbivores have the potential to consume large amounts of plant tissue in tropical forests, but insectivorous vertebrates effectively control their abundances, indirectly increasing plant fitness accordingly. Despite several studies already sought understanding of the top-down effects on arthropod community structure and herbivory, such studies of trophic cascades in old tropics are underrepresented, and little attention was paid to top-down forces in various habitats. Therefore, we examine how flying insectivorous vertebrates (birds and bats) impact arthropods and, consequently, affect herbivore damage of leaves in forest habitats in Papua New Guinea. In a 3-month long predator exclosure experiment conducted at four study sites across varying elevation and successional stage, we found that vertebrate predators reduced arthropod density by similar to 52%. In addition, vertebrate predators decreased the mean body size of arthropods by 26% in leaf chewers and 47% in non-herbivorous arthropods but had only a small effect on mesopredators and sap suckers. Overall, the exclusion of vertebrate predators resulted in a similar to 41% increase in leaf damage. Our results, across different types of tropical forests in Papua New Guinea, demonstrate that flying vertebrate insectivores have a crucial impact on plant biomass, create a selective pressure on larger and non-predatory prey individuals and they prey partition with mesopredators.

AB  - Livestock grazing is a dominant practice in alpine grasslands and plays a crucial role in the ecosystem service of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The effects of grazing on alpine grasslands highly depends on grazing intensity. Up to now, we still lack comprehensive understanding of the general responses of alpine grasslands to different grazing intensities over broad geographic scales across the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to explore the responses of plant characteristics and soil properties to grazing intensity in alpine grasslands of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau based on 52 peer-reviewed literatures. The results showed that grazing did not change the belowground biomass, while significantly increased the ratio of root to shoot (P< 0.05). Light grazing exhibited no significant effects on the plant richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity, soil water content, soil bulk density, nutrients, microbial biomass carbon, and microbial biomass nitrogen (P > 0.05). Moderate grazing significantly increased the plant richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity, while significantly decreased the soil organic carbon and total nitrogen (P< 0.05). Heavy grazing significantly decreased the plant richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity, water content, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon, and microbial biomass nitrogen, and significantly increased the soil bulk density (P< 0.05). These findings suggest that overgrazing is closely associated with grassland degradation, and moderate grazing is a sustainable practice to provide animal production and simultaneously maintain ecological functions for alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - Silvicultural practices, effective fire suppression, and increased browser densities have profoundly altered structural diversity in boreal forests. Prescribed burning and retention forestry may counteract losses in structural diversity in managed forests by maintaining a higher deciduous admixture. We constructed an experiment on 18 sites with three types of timber harvesting (uncut, cut with retention, and clearcut) and burned half of these sites. Subsequently, we established a herbivore treatment with three compartments (unfenced, fenced excluding moose (Alces alces (Linnaeus, 1758)), and fenced excluding moose and hares (Lepus spp.)). In these compartments, we planted rowan ( Sorbus aucuparia L.), European aspen (Populus tremula L.), and silver birch ( Betula pendula Roth) seedlings and monitored these for 17 years. Birch and rowan mortality were lower on cut and burned sites, with retention further enhancing birch survival on these sites. Retention without burning did not lower seedling mortality of any tree species. While browsing resulted in greater mortality on cut sites, burning appeared to greatly reduce browsing on birch and rowan. On mature uncut sites, seedlings of all tree species exhibited high mortality. Our findings show that deciduous tree recruitment can be improved through prescribed burning, particularly for birch and rowan, and that browsing impacts on deciduous trees depend on forest age.

AB  - Factors that influence the composition and diversity of soil nematode communities on oceanic islands are poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the soil nematode communities and associated biotic and abiotic factors on five oceanic islands in the north of the South China Sea. We detected 38 nematode genera and found that bacterivores and fungivores were the dominant trophic groups, representing 54.2-70.4% and 15.1-35.3%, respectively, of total soil nematode abundance. The abundances of total soil nematodes and of all trophic groups, maturity, structure indices and nematode diversity were positively correlated with island latitude and area, and were negatively correlated with soil total K and annual temperature. In addition, the abundances of total soil nematodes, bacterivores, herbivores and nematode dominance index were positively associated with soil available K. The abundances of total soil nematodes, fungivores, herbivores, predators and omnivores, maturity, structure, Shannon diversity indices were positively related to soil moisture. Variation partitioning analysis showed that the combination of soil properties and climatic-geographical factors explained more of the variation (26.8-61.5%). The results suggest that larger island can maintain greater nematode diversity than smaller islands due to the greater diversity of habitats on larger island. The key climatic-geographical and edaphic factors affecting soil nematode communities were latitude, annual temperature, soil moisture and total K, respectively

AB  - Disturbances are an essential component of forest functionality and composition; however, when communities become disrupted, these disturbances may restrict the growth and productivity of species present. Illawarra subtropical rainforest (ISRF) is a threatened ecological community that is influenced by both native and exotic vertebrate herbivores and exotic plant pressures. The ability of ISRF to regenerate following the removal of large herbivores was assessed in fenced and unfenced sites within fragments of rainforest. To investigate the extent to which herbivory was limiting the restoration of ISRF, five native seedlings of each of eight species were planted at six sites, and growth and herbivore activity was compared between fenced and unfenced sites. We investigated seed bank capacity and composition to determine whether recruitment limitation is also preventing regeneration. Over 46 weeks, seedlings in unfenced sites experienced significantly lower growth, which varied amongst species and sites. High activity of feral deer and swamp wallabies caused significant reductions in seedling heights and the number of leaves. Herbivores reduced the growth of seedlings of Brachychiton acerifolius, Planchonella australis, and Breynia oblongifolia more than other species. Pittosporum multiflorum seedlings were not eaten. Only 297 seeds (10% of all seeds germinating) of 21 native species typical of ISRF communities germinated in the seed bank germination trial in the glasshouse. Most native species were missing, reflecting poor recruitment opportunities from a soil-stored seed bank. Seed banks were dominated by 21 exotic species (2125 seedlings-74% of total), presenting a significant risk to the regeneration of the community. Our results indicated that ISRF communities are unlikely to regenerate naturally and require active planting coupled with effective protective measures from all herbivores to restore fragmented vegetation.

AB  - Traditional management of semi-natural grasslands by grazing or annual mowing is not always feasible and the current study set out to evaluate alternative management methods. At eleven locations in southern Sweden, block experiments were conducted evaluating seven treatments in 5 m*20 m plots: grazing, annual mowing, annual spring burning, mowing every third year, mechanical removal of woody plants, herbicide control of woody plants, and untreated control. After approximately 13 years, trends for woody plants and species richness, and the occurrence of management-dependent plant species, low-grown species, and pollinator-attracting plant species were analysed. Overall, the annual mowing and grazing treatments resulted in fewer woody plants, the highest species richness, and more management-dependent, low-grown, and pollinator-attracting species. The untreated control plots showed the opposite effect, whereas less intense management (annual burning, mowing every third year, and mechanical and chemical treatments of woody plants) showed mixed and often intermediate effects. Compared to grazing and mowing, less intense management methods do not constitute long-term management alter-natives to preserve typical features of species-rich grasslands. However, they may be short-term alternatives at sites where the recruitment of woody species is absent or rare. However, to prevent the encroachment of woody species, less intensive management might be a better long-term alternative at more productive sites with slow or inhibited woody species recruitment.

AB  - Grassland degradation is widespread and increasing globally, which is closely related to the sustainable development of the ecosystems and the well-being of human life in pastoral areas. Quantifying the factors influencing grassland ecosystems, specifically climate change and human activities, is of great significance for grassland restoration. However, due to the unpredictability of human activities, further research is still needed to distinguish and identify the factors affecting grasslands. In this study, we examined the changes in the gross primary productivity (GPP) of grassland cover in 10 provinces (autonomous regions) of China from 2000 to 2018 and selected three representative climate factors (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation) and six factors covering socioeconomic (primary industry production and population), animal husbandry (large livestock and sheep populations), and national policies (grazing areas, rodent, and pest control) to characterize human activities; then, we quantified the effects and contribution of climate and human factors using three analysis methods (partial correlation analysis, geographical and temporal weighted regression model, and Lindeman Merenda Gold method). The results indicated that the GPP of grassland presented an obvious uptrend (4.75 g C m(-2) yr(-1), p < 0.05). Among the nine factors, sheep, precipitation, and temperature were the primary factors affecting grassland dynamics. Additionally, the GPP dynamics of grassland were mainly dominated by human activities in seven provinces (autonomous regions). These findings provide decision support for protecting grassland ecosystems and implementing ecological restoration policies in China.

AB  - Freshwater megafauna, such as sturgeons, giant catfishes, river dolphins, hippopotami, crocodylians, large turtles, and giant salamanders, have experienced severe population declines and range contractions worldwide. Although there is an increasing number of studies investigating the causes of megafauna losses in fresh waters, little attention has been paid to synthesising the impacts of megafauna on the abiotic environment and other organisms in freshwater ecosystems, and hence the consequences of losing these species. This limited understanding may impede the development of policies and actions for their conservation and restoration. In this review, we synthesise how megafauna shape ecological processes in freshwater ecosystems and discuss their potential for enhancing ecosystem restoration. Through activities such as movement, burrowing, and dam and nest building, megafauna have a profound influence on the extent of water bodies, flow dynamics, and the physical structure of shorelines and substrata, increasing habitat heterogeneity. They enhance nutrient cycling within fresh waters, and cross-ecosystem flows of material, through foraging and reproduction activities. Freshwater megafauna are highly connected to other freshwater organisms via direct consumption of species at different trophic levels, indirect trophic cascades, and through their influence on habitat structure. The literature documenting the ecological impacts of freshwater megafauna is not evenly distributed among species, regions, and types of ecological impacts, with a lack of quantitative evidence for large fish, crocodylians, and turtles in the Global South and their impacts on nutrient flows and food-web structure. In addition, population decline, range contraction, and the loss of large individuals have reduced the extent and magnitude of megafaunal impacts in freshwater ecosystems, rendering a posteriori evaluation more difficult. We propose that reinstating freshwater megafauna populations holds the potential for restoring key ecological processes such as disturbances, trophic cascades, and species dispersal, which will, in turn, promote overall biodiversity and enhance nature's contributions to people. Challenges for restoration actions include the shifting baseline syndrome, potential human-megafauna competition for habitats and resources, damage to property, and risk to human life. The current lack of historical baselines for natural distributions and population sizes of freshwater megafauna, their life history, trophic interactions with other freshwater species, and interactions with humans necessitates further investigation. Addressing these knowledge gaps will improve our understanding of the ecological roles of freshwater megafauna and support their full potential for facilitating the development of effective conservation and restoration strategies to achieve the coexistence of humans and megafauna.

AB  - Organic by-products are released into the surrounding soil during the terrestrial decomposition of animal remains. The affected area, known as the Cadaver Decomposition Island (CDI), can undergo biochemical changes that contribute to landscape heterogeneity. Soil bacteria are highly sensitive to labile inputs, but it is unknown how they respond to shifts in dissolved organic matter (DOM) quantity and quality resulting from animal decomposition. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between soil DOM composition and bacterial activity/function in CDIs under a Canadian temperate continental climate. This was studied in soils surrounding adult pig carcasses (n = 3) that were surface deposited within a mixed forested environment (Trois-Rivi & egrave;res, Qu & eacute;bec) in June 2019. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and dissolved organic carbon analyses, we detected a pulse of labile protein-like DOM during the summer season (day 55). This was found to be an important driver of heightened soil bacterial respiration, cell abundance and potential carbohydrate metabolism. These bacterial disturbances persisted into the cooler autumn season (day 156) and led to the gradual transformation of labile DOM inputs into microbially sourced humic-like compounds. By the spring (day 324), DOM quantities and bacterial measures almost recovered, but DOM quality remained distinct from surrounding vegetal humic signals. All observed effects were spatially constrained to the topsoil (A-horizon) and within 20 cm laterally from the carcasses. These findings provide valuable insight into CDI organic matter cycling within a cold-climate ecosystem. Repeated CDI studies will however be required to capture the changing dynamics resulting from increasing global temperatures.

AB  - Increasingly, ecological rehabilitation is envisioned to mitigate and revert impacts of ocean sprawl on coastal marine biodiversity. While in the past studies have demonstrated the positive effects of artificial fish habitats in port areas on fish abundance and diversity, benthic colonization of these structures has not yet been taken into consideration. This could be problematic as they may provide suitable habitat for Non-Indigenous Species (NIS) and hence facilitate their spreading. The present study aimed to examine communities developing on artificial fish habitats and to observe if the number of NIS was higher than in surrounding equivalent habitats. The structures were colonized by communities that were significantly different compared to those surrounding the control habitat, and they were home to a greater number of NIS. As NIS can cause severe ecological and economical damages, our results imply that in conjunction with the ecosystem services provided by artificial fish habitats, an ecosystem disservice in the form of facilitated NIS colonization may be present. These effects have not been shown before and need to be considered to effectively decide in which situations artificial structures may be used for fish rehabilitation.

AB  - Reintroduction is a highly effective strategy for rebuilding wildlife populations and restoring their ecosystem functions, but impacts on function are poorly documented. We addressed this gap by comparing the species richness and visit rate of mammals and birds that interact with rhino ( Rhinoceros unicornis ) latrines at two locations in Nepal: Chitwan National Park, with a stable rhino population, and Shuklaphanta National Park, where a rhino reintroduction program was conducted from 2003 to 2018. Camera-traps were used to monitor visitors to 30 latrines in both parks from 2020 to 2021 (669 camera-trap days). The reintroduction of rhinos to Shuklaphanta National Park has played a crucial role in restoring an important resource for other mammal and bird species. Despite a large difference in rhino abundance, and differences in the size, quality and some of the nutritional contents of latrines between sites, there were no significant differences in species richness of latrine visitors and in the frequency of most behaviours at the latrines. Visit rates of animals were higher at the reintroduction site, confirming latrines to be important, limited resources. Overall, 4 mammal and 4 bird species used the latrines to consume the dung, or insects and plants growing on and around the dung; a further two mammal species interacted only indirectly with the latrines. These findings provide evidence that even at low population densities, rhino reintroduction can successfully restore an important ecological function and provide vital resources for other species. Our study supports the rewilding of large-bodied animals to mitigate ecosystem deterioration.

AB  - Background Non-native wild pigs (Sus scrofa) threaten sensitive flora and fauna, cost billions of dollars in economic damage, and pose a significant human-wildlife conflict risk. Despite growing interest in wild pig research, basic life history information is often lacking throughout their introduced range and particularly in tropical environments. Similar to other large terrestrial mammals, pigs possess the ability to shift their range based on local climatic conditions or resource availability, further complicating management decisions. The objectives of this study were to (i) model the distribution and abundance of wild pigs across two seasons within a single calendar year; (ii) determine the most important environmental variables driving changes in pig distribution and abundance; and (iii) highlight key differences between seasonal models and their potential management implications. These study objectives were achieved using zero-inflated models constructed from abundance data obtained from extensive field surveys and remotely sensed environmental variables. Results Our models demonstrate a considerable change in distribution and abundance of wild pigs throughout a single calendar year. Rainfall and vegetation height were among the most influential variables for pig distribution during the spring, and distance to adjacent forest and vegetation density were among the most significant for the fall. Further, our seasonal models show that areas of high conservation value may be more vulnerable to threats from wild pigs at certain times throughout the year, which was not captured by more traditional modeling approaches using aggregated data. Conclusions Our results suggest that (i) wild pigs can considerably shift their range throughout the calendar year, even in tropical environments; (ii) pigs prefer dense forested areas in the presence of either hunting pressure or an abundance of frugivorous plants, but may shift to adjacent areas in the absence of either of these conditions; and (iii) seasonal models provide valuable biological information that would otherwise be missed by common modeling approaches that use aggregated data over many years. These findings highlight the importance of considering biologically relevant time scales that provide key information to better inform management strategies, particularly for species whose ranges include both temperate and tropical environments and thrive in both large continental and small island ecosystems.

AB  - Sea level rise threatens ecosystem function in coastal lakes by increasing salinity and altering community composition. As mobile generalists, fish have considerable influence on the stability of a system by impacting trophic network structure. Understanding their diet across abiotic gradients, including salinity, can show key characteristics of their ecological role, and predator diet shifts may serve as warning signs of food web restructuring. Stomach contents analysis was used to look at the diet of Retropinna retropinna (common smelt) across shallow coastal lakes on Rekohu (Chatham Island). Smelt diets from 10 lakes (seven freshwater; three salt-influenced) were analysed. Comparisons of salt-influenced and freshwater lakes showed shifts in composition. Smelt in freshwater lakes predominantly consumed herbivorous, omnivorous, or predatory insect larvae while diet in salt-influenced lakes was dominanted by crustacean shredders. Population diet varied somewhat less among salt-influenced lakes than among freshwater lakes, suggesting homogenisation of smelt diet with salinity. Differences in composition and heterogeneity did not translate to consistent differences in total niche width or individual specialisation between freshwater and salt-influenced lakes. Further development of knowledge on biological structure across salinity gradients is essential to understand ecosystem function under future climate scenarios.

AB  - Fires are a disturbance that can lead to short term dune destabilisation and have been suggested to be an initiation mechanism of a transgressive dune phase when paired with changing climatic conditions. Fire severity is one potential factor that could explain subsequent coastal dune destabilisations, but contemporary evidence of destabilisation following fire is lacking. In addition, the suitability of conventional satellite Earth Observation methods to detect the impacts of fire and the relative fire severity in coastal dune environments is in question. Widely applied satellite-derived burn indices (Normalised Burn Index and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) have been suggested to underestimate the effects of fire in heterogenous landscapes or areas with sparse vegetation cover. This work assesses burn severity from high resolution aerial and Sentinel 2 satellite imagery following the 2019/2020 Black Summer fires on Kangaroo Island in South Australia, to assess the efficacy of commonly used satellite indices, and validate a new method for assessing fire severity in coastal dune systems. The results presented here show that the widely applied burn indices derived from NBR differentially assess vegetation loss and fire severity when compared in discrete soil groups across a landscape that experienced a very high severity fire. A new application of the Tasselled Cap Transformation (TCT) and Disturbance Index (DI) is presented. The differenced Disturbance Index (dDI) improves the estimation of burn severity, relative vegetation loss, and minimises the effects of differing soil conditions in the highly heterogenous landscape of Kangaroo Island. Results suggest that this new application of TCT is better suited to diverse environments like Mediterranean and semi-arid coastal regions than existing indices and can be used to better assess the effects of fire and potential remobilisation of coastal dune systems.

AB  - Context Wild ungulates are an important component of natural ecosystems and one of the most important ecological groups of grassland ecosystems. The goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa) is a species widely distributed in arid and semi-arid desert regions and is listed on the IUCN Red List (2016) as a threatened, vulnerable species at high risk for extinction in the wild. Goitered gazelle often lives in vast habitats; however, it is not yet clear how they adapt to isolated 'islands'.Aims We selected an international nature reserve in the arid region of central Ningxia, China, as our study area, trying to understand how the goitered gazelle adapts to this microenvironment from the perspectives of habitat and diet.Methods We employed the optimized maximum entropy model and DNA metabarcoding to investigate the species' suitable habitat distribution and feeding habits.Key results The results showed that the MaxEnt model performed well, with an area under curve value of 0.896 and a true skill statistic value of 0.704 for predicting the species distribution. Suitable habitats accounted for 80.9% of the total area of the reserve. Annual mean temperature, and elevation, together with the distance from water source were the critical factors that affected the goitered gazelle distribution range. Sequencing analysis indicated that among the 35 fecal samples collected, there were 18 plant families, and 21 genera annotated. The bulk food of goitered gazelle was Fabaceae and Rosaceae.Conclusions Water sources and altitude significantly influenced the distribution of the goitered gazelle. Trnl, as a DNA barcode, holds potential in the dietary analysis of goitered gazelles and can serve as a complement to traditional research methods.Implications This study confirmed the reliability of the optimized maximum entropy model for predicting suitable habitats at a small scale, and it is the first to apply DNA metabarcoding technology to the dietary analysis of the goitered gazelle. We also have more knowledge about how the goitered gazelle adapts to the isolated island habitat, laying the foundation for better protection of this species in the future.

AB  - In wild boar, Sus scrofa, from Europe, domestic pig-typical ancestry is traced at varying levels. We hypothesised wild boar with pig-typical gene pool characteristics, i.e., "introgression", congregate more in peri-urban habitats, because of less shyness and better adaptation to anthropogenic stress. We used 16 microsatellites to study introgression levels of 375 wild boar from peri-urban Vienna, Austria, and rural regions in comparison to commercial slaughter pigs, Mangaliza, and Turopolje pigs. We also expected more introgression in locations of warmer climates and lower precipitation. Despite discrimination of wild boar and pigs with 99.73% and 97.87% probability, respectively, all wild boars exhibited pig-typical gene pool characteristics, mostly at a very low level. Recent hybridisation was suspected in only 0.53% of wild boar, corresponding to the current largely indoor pig breeding/rearing in the region, with no chance of natural gene exchange between pigs and wild boar. Rather, pig ancestry in wild boar stems from incomplete gene pool differentiation during domestication and/or historical introgressions, when free-ranging pig farming was common. Individual introgression levels were lower in wild boar from peri-urban habitats, possibly reflecting the largely historical absence of pig farms there. Moreover, a marginal precipitation effect, but no temperature effect on introgression was observed. The latter, however, needs to be explored further by a more comprehensive data set.

AB  - Background and aims Grazing pressure can degrade environmental quality and disrupt ecosystem structure and functions, while its potential effect on the soil microbiome is unclear. Method We evaluated the effects of grazing intensity (CK: no grazing, LG: light grazing, MG: moderate grazing, HG: heavy grazing, and OG: overgrazing) on soil microbial diversity and community composition in a desert steppe. Results Different microbial communities were found under different grazing intensities, resulting from differences in soil moisture, nutrients and plant species. Alpha-diversity in the bacterial community was strongly correlated with soil organic content (SOC) and soil water content, while the alpha-diversity of the fungi depended on the SOC and pH of the soil. Grazing treatments LG, HG and OG caused strong shifts in bacterial and fungal community composition. Heavy grazing (HG and OG) significantly increased the relative abundances of Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, and Firmicutes bacteria, while light grazing (LG) significantly decreased the relative abundance of Actinobacteria. Grazing intensities HG and OG increased the relative abundances of certain fungi (e.g., Ascomycota). Co-occurrence network analysis indicated that bacterial communities had a more complex network than fungal communities. A multivariate regression tree demonstrated that the bacterial community responded to grazing via changes in the biomass of perennial plant species and SOC, whereas the SOC and pH value altered the fungal community composition. Conclusions Our findings indicate that different grazing intensities can initiate different changes in the soil microbiome; sustainable grazing intensity over decades facilitates the recovery of primary productivity and ecosystem functions in a desert steppe.

AB  - Wildlife corridors are critical for the effective conservation of wildlife and for enhancing ecosystem services. Unfortunately, increased human pressure has increased the risk of species extinction in wildlife corridors. Studies on wildlife corridor connectivity have always used Geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) without information from ground surveys thus lacking comprehensive conclusions for effective management. We assessed wildlife corridor connectivity between the Wami-Mbiki Game Reserve???Nyerere National Park (WMGR-NYENAPA) in Tanzania, using a combination of ground transect surveys, RS, and GIS. Overall, the RS and GIS showed a decline in the woody cover types over the past 40 years. Forest and woodland declined by 9% and 17% respectively between 1980 and 2020. Conversely, the land conversions namely agriculture and settlement increased by 4.7% and 0.1%, respectively. The spatial distribution of the twenty-two (22) wildlife species recorded using ground surveys was negatively affected by increasing land conversions. Although plant diversity to support wildlife survival was abundant, suggesting the suitability of the corridor for wildlife, elephant movements were severed as one might predict in a degraded corridor. We urge protecting the remaining corridor area. We further recommend a combination of actions to secure the remaining part of the corridor including enforcement of existing land use regulations that restrict land clearance, improving cross-sectoral dialogues on sustainable conservation by harmonizing conflicting legislation between conservation and land development, formulating a specific organ with the mandate to manage cross-cutting issues on wildlife corridors and introducing community con-servation education and awareness through extension programs on poaching, sustainable utili-zation of natural land resources including REDD+ programs and adoption of alternative income source activities.

AB  - Mega-herbivore or elephant fences aim to prevent target animals (here: African savanna elephant Loxodonta africana, giraffe Giraffa giraffa) from crossing while allowing others, often with the intention to protect an area against elephants-for conservation, economic or research purposes. However, little is known about mega-herbivore fence effectiveness and impact on non-target species, for example impact on meso-herbivore movement, or fence avoidance. We hypothesised that mega-herbivore fences are effective in excluding mega-herbivores, whereas other species remain unaffected. We tested this hypothesis by comparing mammalian species abundance in (i) full exclosures, (ii) mega-herbivore exclosures and (iii) open plots. These plots were part of the Lapalala Elephant Landscape Experiment (LELE) project in Lapalala Wilderness, South Africa. Systematic dung pile recording and animal track counts-supported with video footage from camera traps-were used to quantify species-specific animal abundance using generalised linear mixed-effect models. The dung piles showed no difference in the abundance of non-target species between mega-herbivore exclosures and open plots, while target species were successfully excluded. Interestingly, we found fewer tracks of large non-target herbivores, such as plains zebra (Equus quagga) and greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) crossing mega-herbivore fences compared to open plots, indicating that some individuals avoided crossing the mega-herbivore fence lines. We suggest that this avoidance is due to a combination of species-specific vigilance and deterrence of large specimens. Further research is needed to determine whether this avoidance persists over time, and if the absence of large non-target animals affects ecosystem functioning. Mega-herbivore fences are an effective means to prevent the movement of target species. However, some individuals of non-target species also avoid crossing these fences, likely large animals due to the minimum height of the fence. We recommend monitoring the movement of species once elephant fences are erected, and to increase minimum fence height if non-target species are affected.

AB  - Over the last century, Texas has been inundated with exotic ungulates, with as many as 67 species represented by captive and free-ranging populations. One of the most successful species to have established free-ranging populations is the Aoudad (Ammotragus lervia). Herein, we expand on previous genetic studies in Aoudad by including new genomic profiles based on double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing methods with the intent of better understanding the effects of >70 years of human-mediated translocations, population expansion, and gene flow among populations. Using a range of 4,338 to 5,529 single-nucleotide polymorphisms obtained from 73 individuals that potentially represented A. l. blainei, A. l. lervia, and A. l. sahariensis, we measured genetic patterns of diversity and connectivity between source populations from California and New Mexico and resultant aoudad populations in Texas. Principal component analyses identified phylogeographically structured populations across Texas. Further, we identified a signature of isolation by distance among Texas populations. To assess geographic regions that facilitated or blocked gene flow between populations, we used estimation of effective migration surfaces, which indicated 3 barriers to movement between populations as well as connectivity among populations in close proximity. Comparison of mtDNA haplogroups and nuclear genotypes among the 3 examined subspecies were discordant, indicating that the current subspecific taxonomic classification needs refinement. Given the vulnerable status of Aoudad in their native range of northern Africa and the exponential population growth and potential competition with native ungulates in Texas, we propose that efforts to manage non-native Aoudad should strive to maintain and preserve unique genetic units while minimizing competition and other detriments to native species in Texas. Conservation efforts are especially important given the vulnerable status of Aoudad within their native range of northern Africa.

AB  - The current biodiversity loss is alarming. Protected areas can be a key strategy to halt and reverse the downward trend. To evaluate their efficiency and to conduct global biodiversity assessments, the availability of reliable data on species occurrence, diversity, and abundance is critical. Camera traps provide these data and have been used extensively in areas with high species richness, such as, temperate and tropical ecosystems, and are currently becoming more prominent in hyper-arid regions. We augment the data from hyper-arid regions by providing one of the first studies on biodiversity of terrestrial mammals and birds using camera traps at sites in central Saudi Arabia. From the deployments at 64 locations in 1.5 years, we observed a total of 59 vertebrate species with 12 species categorized as threatened on the IUCN Red List and an additional 12 that are deemed to have a high conservation priority in Saudi Arabia. This information can contribute to global biodiversity assessments and confirms the importance of the study sites as regional places of refuge. Results from this study also provide information that can support conservation management. We show that water provision was especially important to the sand gazelle. Additionally, observations of newborns of reintroduced species and the presence of predators contribute to evaluating the effectiveness and suitability of reintroduction programs to restore native biodiversity.

AB  - Livestock grazing is the most extensive land use in global drylands and one of the most extensive stressors of biological soil crusts (biocrusts). Despite widespread concern about the importance of biocrusts for global carbon (C) cycling, little is known about whether and how long-term grazing alters soil organic carbon (SOC) stability and stock in the biocrust layer. To assess the responses of SOC stability and stock in the biocrust layer to grazing, from June to September 2020, we carried out a large scale field survey in the restored grasslands under long-term grazing with different grazing intensities (represented by the number of goat dung per square meter) and in the grasslands strictly excluded from grazing in four regions (Dingbian County, Shenmu City, Guyuan City and Ansai District) along precipitation gradient in the hilly Loess Plateau, China. In total, 51 representative grassland sites were identified as the study sampling sites in this study, including 11 sites in Guyuan City, 16 sites in Dingbian County, 15 sites in Shenmu City and 9 sites in Ansai District. Combined with extensive laboratory analysis and statistical analysis, at each sampling site, we obtained data on biocrust attributes (cover, community structure, biomass and thickness), soil physical-chemical properties (soil porosity and soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N ratio)), and environmental factors (mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, altitude, plant cover, litter cover, soil particle-size distribution (the ratio of soil clay and silt content to sand content)), SOC stability index (SI) and SOC stock (SOCS) in the biocrust layer, to conduct this study. Our results revealed that grazing did not change total biocrust cover but markedly altered biocrust community structure by reducing plant cover, with a considerable increase in the relative cover of cyanobacteria (23.1%) while a decrease in the relative cover of mosses (42.2%). Soil porosity and soil C/N ratio in the biocrust layer under grazing decreased significantly by 4.1%-7.2% and 7.2%-13.3%, respectively, compared with those under grazing exclusion. The shifted biocrust community structure ultimately resulted in an average reduction of 15.5% in SOCS in the biocrust layer under grazing. However, compared with higher grazing (intensity of more than 10.00 goat dung/m(2)), light grazing (intensity of 0.00-10.00 goat dung/m(2) or approximately 1.20-2.60 goat/(hm(2)& BULL;a)) had no adverse effect on SOCS. SOC stability in the biocrust layer remained unchanged under long-term grazing due to the offset between the positive effect of the decreased soil porosity and the negative effect of the decreased soil C/N ratio on the SOC resistance to decomposition. Mean annual precipitation and soil particle-size distribution also regulated SOC stability indirectly by influencing soil porosity through plant cover and biocrust community structure. These findings suggest that proper grazing might not increase the CO2 release potential or adversely affect SOCS in the biocrust layer. This research provides some guidance for proper grazing management in the sustainable utilization of grassland resources and C sequestration in biocrusts in the hilly regions of drylands.

AB  - Endemic species comprise 16% of the floral species on Guadalupe Island, including three arboreal species. Almost 96% of the forest coverage was lost due to impacts related to feral goats and wildfires. To date, goats have been eradicated and the restoration of the native vegetation communities is underway. The purpose of this study was to develop a 3D Structural Classification Method (3D-SCM) using Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) for mapping the vertical structure of the forest and to automatically characterize its physical attributes. Several TLS scans were performed in July 2016 to assess this recovery, particularly the succession progression. The 3D-SCM used the Forest Condition Classification (FCC) based on radiometric intensity and height values, and the Individual Shape Index (ISI) based on geometry and intensity parameters. It was designed to classify vegetation by stratum using a trial-and-error model to semi-automatically identify impacted areas and succession. The 3D-SCM was able to differentiate the vegetation strata by each forest community at the stand level with a precision of 93% as well as the tree structure parts (stem, branches, and leaves) with a precision of 97%, it also fits the best characteristic shape for the Guadalupe cypress (decagon) and for the pine (droplet). The resulting 3D-SCM provide precise physical specifications, demonstrates a high correlation R-2 = 0.949 for (Diameter Breast Height) DBH, R-2 = 0.974 for the crown and R-2 = 0.97 for heights between maximum laser pulse of tree heights and crowns with respect to field measurements. Mapping 3D vertical forest measurements are important for quantifying the success of management practices and to assist future restoration actions, as it will allow quantification of forest dynamics and carbon sequestration on this island.

AB  - Axis deer (Axis axis), an introduced invasive species of growing concern around the globe, have rapidly expanded through the southern cone countries in South America. Despite increasing culling efforts over 14 years, axis deer remained abundant at El Palmar National Park in north-eastern Argentina. We tested whether this continued abundance possibly reflected control failures as a result of adjacent plantation forests providing a safe-haven refuge for deer. We carried out a cross-sectional survey of deer faecal pellet groups and tracks in 77 matched pairs of 25 m(2) plots deployed at random over the park-plantation interface and assessed the presence of deer trails along the 14.2-km wire fence between both land-use types. The relative odds of having at least one pellet group (occupancy) were 4.5 (95% CI 1.5 to 18.3) times higher among park plots than plantation plots. Using generalized linear mixed models, the relative odds of occupancy decreased significantly with increasing distance to the main permanent water course, but it was 83% lower in plantation plots than in the park plots. Principal component analysis of shrub cover, plant structure and plant height revealed greater shelter within the park. Deer trails were spatially aggregated up to 2300 m and were directly associated with deer occupancy. These results indicate that, in El Palmar National Park interface, plantation forests do not provide a refuge or selected habitat, and suggest instead that the environmental characteristics and diversity of habitats within the protected area are relevant for the effectiveness of the exotic ungulate management program.

AB  - Introduced predators currently threaten endemic animals on Madagascar through predation, facilitation of human-led hunts, competition, and disease transmission, but the antiquity and past consequences of these introductions are poorly known. We use directly radiocarbon dated bones of introduced dogs (Canis familiaris) to test whether dogs could have aided human-led hunts of the island's extinct megafauna. We compare carbon and nitrogen isotope data from the bone collagen of dogs and endemic "fosa" (Cryptoprocta spp.) in central and southwestern Madagascar to test for competition between introduced and endemic predators. The distinct isotopic niches of dogs and fosa suggest that any past antagonistic relationship between these predators did not follow from predation or competition for shared prey. Radiocarbon dates confirm that dogs have been present on Madagascar for over a millennium and suggest that they at least briefly co-occurred with the island's extinct megafauna, which included giant lemurs, elephant birds, and pygmy hippopotamuses. Today, dogs share a mutualism with pastoralists who also occasionally hunt endemic vertebrates, and similar behavior is reflected in deposits at several Malagasy paleontological sites that contain dog and livestock bones along with butchered bones of extinct megafauna and extant lemurs. Dogs on Madagascar have had a wide range of diets during the past millennium, but relatively high stable carbon isotope values suggest few individuals relied primarily on forest bushmeat. Our newly generated data suggest that dogs were part of a suite of animal introductions beginning over a millennium ago that coincided with widespread landscape transformation and megafaunal extinction.

AB  - The perpetuation of tree populations is dependent on successful seedling establishment, which is in turn controlled by biotic and climatic factors. California's endemic oak species face limited recruitment and shrinking ranges due to anthropogenic climate change and land use, both of which can negatively impact germination and seedling survival. In this study, we investigated Quercus seed germination and seedling establishment under three large herbivore regimes (no large herbivores, wild herbivores, and both wild herbivores and cattle) across three sites representing present, near-future, and far-future projections for climate in California's montane oak woodlands. Seed germination and living seedling abundance were highest in the intermediate and mesic climate levels, where total exclosures resulted in the best outcomes for seedlings. In contrast, in the arid level, the best large herbivore regime for establishment consisted of wild herbivores and no cattle. Seedling mortality was highest in the most arid climate level, and within that level, mortality was reduced by over 25% in both the wildlife and wildlife plus cattle treatments compared to the total exclosures. Our results suggest that increasing aridity will limit oak establishment and modulate the impact of large herbivores on oak seedlings, with wild large herbivores becoming a beneficial factor for seedling abundance, and both wild herbivores and cattle reducing mortality. Dynamic and contextually informed management of large herbivore populations and other restoration actions will be necessary to ensure the sustainability of California's oak populations.

AB  - Many South American dry woodlands lack good historical or paleoecological baseline data to inform restoration and conservation. However, functionalist approaches such as those popularized by rewilding suggest that functional interactions producing target ecosystem processes are valid even without data confirming compositionalist values such as a long coevolutionary histories or known historical range overlaps of target species. In central Chile, the guanaco (Lama guanicoe) has been extirpated but is known to browse trees in other regions of South America, and the tree Vachellia [Acacia] caven shows adaptations to browsing but has no extant browsers within its Chilean range. Both species are native to Chile but there are no data to assess their historical levels of interaction. Here we test the hypothesis that they can act as mutual "Eltonian proxy" species: interacting species for which we lack sufficient data (the Eltonian shortfall) to prove they are not proxies. Specifically we predict that they have complementary adaptations such that guanacos will browse Vachellia [Acacia] caven and the latter will show adaptive responses to their browsing. We introduced five guanacos into an enclosure of Vachellia [Acacia] caven "espinal" woodland, and over two years measured the growth responses of individual branches, compared to branches of trees in an area without browsing. We predicted that Vachellia [Acacia] caven would show compensatory growth in response to guanaco browsing resulting in an increase in branching. Guanacos browsed throughout the two years. In the presence of guanaco browsing, Vachellia [Acacia] caven branches grew longer, grew more sub-branches, and showed more densely streamlined branch architectures. These results indicate that guanacos could be used to substitute anthropogenic pruning as a restoration and management technique in Vachellia [Acacia] caven "espinal" woodlands. However, other extinct megaherbivores or extirpated deer may also be key components of a past herbivore community to which Vachellia [Acacia] caven was adapted. Further attention to a network of multiple interacting browsers, and their indirect and nontrophic effects, is an area for further research.

AB  - Coastal wetland ecosystems play critical roles in mitigating climate change by sequestering substantial amounts of carbon in vegetation and sediments. The Laynhapuy Indigenous Protected Area, northern Australia, includes culturally significant floodplains that support diverse coastal wetlands. The Yirralka Rangers and Yol & eng;u Traditional Owners who manage this region have identified invasive ungulates as a key threat to wetlands. Paperbark forests, with species known to Yol & eng;u as ra & eng;an (Melaleuca viridiflora) and n & auml;mbarra (Melaleuca cajuputi), have experienced ungulate damage combined with dieback due to saltwater intrusion. Sedgelands, dominated by culturally significant r & auml;kay (Eleocharis dulcis), suffer annual soil and vegetation damage caused by invasive pigs (Sus scrofa) and buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). The Rangers and Macquarie University scientists established an ungulate exclusion fenced plot array in 2018 across a supratidal paperbark forest and sedgeland on the Gurrumuru floodplain. To assess carbon cycle impacts, belowground carbon stocks in sediments and biomass were quantified, along with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the plot array. Our findings revealed fourfold higher GHG emissions (combined CO2 and CH4) in locations damaged by invasive ungulates compared to undamaged sites in the early dry season. Belowground biomass increased by 21%-104% within exclusion plots compared with damaged plots. No significant differences in soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) stocks or rates of litter decomposition were found between damaged and undamaged plots. This study contributes to potential carbon crediting methods focused on reducing feral ungulate impacts to wetlands, that could help fund coastal floodplain wetland management.

AB  - The introduction of exotic species to new habitats has been a historical human practice, ranging from utilitarian benefits to conservation efforts. This phenomenon has intensified over time, resulting in unexpected ecological and socio-economic impacts on receiving ecosystems. The case of the North African aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) introduction in the SE Iberian Peninsula in 1970 illustrates the multifaceted consequences and complexities associated with species introduction. Aoudad's introduction can be contextualized in four categories regarding socio-economic and ecological contexts, such as assisted colonization, hunting interest, taxon substitution, and trophic rewilding. Initially, the establishment of the species was promoted, and its growth favoured. However, its expansion along with ecological and socio-economic impacts led to conservation conflicts and impacts on human activities. Over the last two decades, aoudad management has shifted focus to active population control to mitigate ecological and socio-economic risks. Such species introductions highlight the challenge of predicting ecological and socio-economic outcomes, given the limited understanding of complex ecosystem dynamics and social context changes. Recent propositions regarding conservation strategies involving species introductions must heed the lessons from the aoudad case. The aoudad case emphasizes the importance of applying precautionary principles in species introductions, given the potential for irreversible consequences posed by established populations of introduced species.

AB  - The sedimentary sequence of La Narce du Be ' age Basin is one of the few natural archives covering the last 18 ka cal. BP in the French Massif Central. This paper focuses on the palaeoecological reconstruction of environmental and climatic changes affecting this shallow periglacial lake from the Late-Glacial to the Early Holocene. After field surveys and geophysical mapping, two cores (cores A and D) were extracted and dated. Plant macrofossils, pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) and diatom assemblages were compared within the cores to study vegetation, temperature, pH, water level and ice cover changes through time. During the Oldest Dryas (18-14.75 ka cal. BP), climatic conditions were the coldest with a short ice-free season allowing the development of periphytic diatoms only (ecologically comparable to Arctic ones). A cold and dry steppe landscape - exposed to severe erosion - comprised an herbaceous and shrub flora (e.g. Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, Helianthemum, Ephedra, Hippophae center dot, Juniperus). Animal presence is suggested by coprophilous fungi. Periphytic diatoms and allochtonous pollen (Cedrus) underline windy conditions, and the possible erosion of neo-formed soils. Then, during the Bolling-Allerod interstadial (14.75-12.7 ka cal. BP), the ice-free season increased and some trees/ shrubs (Salix, Betula and Juniperus) established locally within open grasslands. During the Younger Dryas (12.7-11.7 ka cal. BP) cooler conditions favoured steppe taxa again (Helianthemum, Achillea, Artemisia, Car-yophyllaceae, Ranunculaceae) and erosion increased. The ice cover on the lake prevailed even if the conditions were not as cold as during the Oldest Dryas. During the Preboreal (11.7-10 ka cal. BP) Isoe center dot tes echinospora and I. lacustris developed in the eulittoral zone of the lake, which was surrounded by a swamp forest (with Betula nana and B. pubescens). Pinus sylvestris, Betula pendula, Corylus avellana and trees from the Quercetum mixtum rapidly established in the uplands. Occurrences of Gaeumannomyces and Xylomyces fungi - both phytopathogens on broadleaved trees - and decreasing herb values indirectly hint at a close forest canopy. At the beginning of the Boreal (10 ka cal. BP), aquatic and semi-aquatic taxa developed on open water due to longer ice-free seasons (diatoms, micro-algae, Alisma plantago-aquatica, Potamogeton, Typha). The final terrestrialization towards a mire occurred as a consequence of the Holocene warming and related to water chemistry changes (acidification, eutrophication).

AB  - Plant pathogens and their hosts often coexist with mammal grazers. However, the direction and strength of grazing effects on foliar fungal diseases can be idiosyncratic, varying among host plant species and pathogen types.
   We combined a 6 yr yak-grazing experiment, a clipping experiment simulating different mammal consumption patterns (leaf damage vs whole-leaf removal), and a meta-analysis of 63 comparisons to evaluate how grazing impacts foliar fungal diseases across plant growth types (grass vs forb) and pathogen life histories (biotroph vs necrotroph).
   In the yak-grazing experiment, grazing had no significant effect on disease severity, and grasses experienced a higher disease severity than forbs; there was a significant interaction between pathogen type and grazing. In both the yak-grazing experiment and meta-analysis, grazing decreased biotrophic pathogens (mainly rusts and powdery mildew), but did not affect necrotrophic pathogens (mainly leaf spots). The clipping experiment suggested that grazers might promote infection by necrotrophic pathogens by producing wounds on leaves, but inhibit biotrophic pathogens via leaf removal.
   In conclusion, our three-part approach revealed that intrinsic properties of both plants and pathogens shape patterns of disease in natural ecosystems, greatly improving our ability to predict disease severity under mammal grazing.

AB  - Fencing is an important and common grassland management strategy for restoring areas degraded by grazing. However, experimental evidence regarding the differences between the effects of short-term and long-term fencing on grassland structure remains insufficient, and the mechanisms by which fencing influences plant diversity and community structure are not yet fully understood. A long-term fencing experiment was conducted in a Tibetan meadow. We investigated Hill diversity, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), plant community height, species richness, and the biomass and height of four plant functional groups (including grasses, forbs, legumes, and sedges) after 1, 2, 3, and 13 years of fencing. This allowed us to compare the differing impacts of fencing on diversity and community structure over time. Additionally, we collected data on environmental factors such as soil compaction, soil moisture, soil nutrients, and plant litter biomass to elucidate the effects of fencing on plant communities. Our results indicated that short-term fencing increased Hill diversity within plant communities. Conversely, long-term fencing significantly decreased Hill diversity in alpine meadows. Furthermore, fencing reduced aboveground net primary productivity across all four assessment periods. Plant diversity exhibited a positive correlation with soil compaction and soil moisture, but a negative correlation with community height, litter biomass, and litter height. Fencing primarily influenced the diversity of litter biomass, community height, and soil nitrate nitrogen content across all biotic and abiotic factors. Our findings demonstrate that the effects of short-term and long-term fencing on plant communities differ markedly. Long-term fencing can adversely affect plant communities through litter accumulation and alterations in soil physical properties; therefore, the duration of fencing must be considered in grassland restoration efforts.

AB  - The Mongolian marmot (Marmota sibirica) is a relatively large-bodied, social rodent that lives in colonies across the Mongolian steppes and adjacent parts of China and Russia. Marmots serve as ecosystem engineers that display multiple functions on the steppe environments they inhabit. Mongolian marmots experienced a >75% decline across Mongolia in the 1990s that led to their listing as endangered globally. The decline of marmots likely af-fected other species given their importance to the ecosystems they inhabit. To examine the role of marmots on herpetofauna, we established drift fence arrays with associated pitfall and funnel traps on active marmot colonies, inactive colonies, and control sites in the forest-steppe and semi-desert zones of Mongolia. In total, we identified 555 individuals representing 5 species of reptiles in Ikh Nart Nature Reserve (semi-desert) from 2010 - 2011 and 22 individuals of 3 species of reptiles and one amphibian species in Hustai National Park (forest-steppe) in 2014 and 2016. We found significantly higher species abundance and some diversity indices on active and inactive colo-nies compared to control sites in Hustai. Vegetation height and cover significantly affected the abundance and spe-cies richness of reptiles in Ikh Nart. In Ikh Nart, we found that under conditions of higher vegetation cover and height, reptiles were distributed more widely across the landscape, but with lower vegetation cover and height, reptiles associated more strongly with marmot burrows. Burrows likely provide shelter from extreme climatic con-ditions and refugia from predation. Our research provides insights into how marmots create important habitats for associated fauna. This and similar experimental approaches will allow us to better understand the biodiversity pat-terns in and around marmot burrows.

AB  - Extreme drought and insect herbivores can affect plant community non-independently, and their interaction may be influenced by drought pattern. However, few studies have explored the interaction on plant community structure, and no study has investigated whether the interaction is affected by drought pattern. We explored the interaction of different extreme drought patterns and insect herbivores with a manipulated experiment in a semiarid grassland. There were three treatments for drought: control-ambient precipitation; chronic drought-66% precipitation reduction in the growing season (May-August); intense drought-completely exclusion of rain events from June to July. Herbivores removal and present treatments were imposed within each drought treatment. We found that although herbivores had no significant effects on the impacts of droughts on total species richness, it alleviated the impacts of chronic drought on total cover, and the alleviating role decreased under intense drought. Comparing with intense drought, more increasing of grass cover led to more alleviation under chronic drought associated with the decrease of forb which has low leaf carbon and dry matter content, along with high starch, calcium, magnesium and manganese concentration. These results indicate that the interaction of drought and herbivores is affected by drought pattern, and the changes in leaf traits that reduce herbivores feeding in grass might alleviate the impact of drought on grassland.

AB  - The construction of the Suez Canal connected the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, which allowed rapid marine bio-invasion. Over the last century, several bivalve species have invaded the Levantine basin, yet their distribution and impact on the benthic community have not been thoroughly studied. Large-scale benthic surveys along the rocky substrate of the Israeli Mediterranean coastline indicate that invading bivalves, such as Spondylus spinosus, Brachidontes pharaonis, and Pinctada radiata, now dominate the rocky environment, with densities of tens to hundreds of individuals per m(2). No native bivalve specimens were found in any of the transects surveyed. The small-scale ecological effects of the established invading populations on the benthic community were examined over a year using an in-situ exclusion experiment where all invading bivalves were either physically removed or poisoned and kept in place to maintain the physical effect of the shells. Surprisingly, the experimental exclusion showed a little measurable effect of bivalve presence on the invertebrate community in close vicinity (similar to 1 m). Bivalve presence had a small, but statistically significant, effect only on the community composition of macroalgae, increasing the abundance of some filamentous macroalgae and reducing the cover of turf. The generally low impact of bivalves removal could be due to (1) wave activity and local currents dispersing the bivalve excreta, (2) high grazing pressure, possibly by invading herbivorous fish, reducing the bottom-up effect of increased nutrient input by the bivalves, or (3) the natural complexity of the rocky habitat masking the contribution of the increased complexity associated with the bivalve's shell. We found that established invading bivalves have replaced native bivalve species, yet their exclusion has a negligible small-scale effect on the local benthic community.

AB  - Social competition for resources is widespread among animals. Females of many species compete for foraging resources through interference competition, which is a behavioural interaction between animals that reduces an individual's access to shared resources. In addition to competition from other females, females also often face harassment from males during and after the breeding season. The female competition hypothesis predicts that female-initiated aggression associated with foraging competition increases as a function of group size, but we expected this effect to be more pronounced in higher quality foraging habitat. The male harassment hypothesis predicts that male harassment of females should also increase as a function of group size as well as a function of the ratio of males to other group members. Here, we tested the female competition and male harassment hypotheses for caribou (Rangifer tarandus) within the context of variation in the social environment (i.e., group size and sex ratio) and the physical environment (i.e., variation in habitat quality). We conducted focal observations of caribou on Fogo Island, Newfoundland, over three years and quantified aggressive social interactions in different habitat types to test our hypotheses. Specifically, we took advantage of natural variation in caribou behaviour in our system and observed caribou foraging in an enhanced habitat (i.e., recreational sports complex field) and natural habitat (i.e., lichen barrens). We found limited support for the female competition hypothesis, possibly because of females' propensity to increase foraging rates in enhanced habitats. By contrast, we found strong support for the male harassment hypothesis, where males increase the frequency of harassment as group size increased. Our results suggest costs of grouping for female caribou in the post-rut time period may be related to the presence of males potentially seeking mating opportunities.

AB  - The extinction of all Madagascar's megafrugivores ca 1000 years ago, may have left its signature on the current distribution of vertebrate-dispersed plants across the island, due to the loss of effective seed dispersal. In this study, we dissect the roles of extinct and extant frugivore distributions, abiotic variables, human impact and spatial predictors on the compositional turnover, or beta-diversity, of palm (Arecaceae) species and their dispersal-related traits across 40 assemblages in Madagascar. Variation partitioning showed that palm beta-diversity is mostly shaped by the distribution of extant frugivores (eight lemur, three bird, two rodent and one bat species) and the abiotic environment (e.g. forest cover, slope and temperature), and to a lesser extent by the distribution of extinct megafrugivores (several giant lemur and elephant bird species). However, the contribution of these variables differed between dry western assemblages and wet eastern assemblages, with a more prominent role, albeit still small, of extinct megafrugivores in the west. These results suggest that palm distributions in the dry west of Madagascar, where megafrugivores were probably most abundant in the past, still show signatures of past interactions. With a fourth-corner analysis we observed that the distribution of palm species with relatively large fruits and seeds was negatively associated with frugivore richness of both past and present communities and home range sizes of extant mammalian frugivores. This suggests that palm species with relatively large fruits tend to occur in places with fewer, small-ranged mammalian frugivores, which may indicate dysfunctional seed dispersal. Nevertheless, our results also indicate that several wide-ranging bird species with high dispersal ability (large hand-wing index) that also occasionally feed on fruits may compensate for this potential dispersal loss. Our study sheds new light on dispersal anachronisms in Madagascar, and how defaunation and past species interactions may underlie current plant distributions.

AB  - Most extinctions worldwide have occurred on islands, primarily due to interactions with exotic species, but rarely due to interactions among endemic species. This potential exists on two of the California Channel Islands, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa, as endemic island spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis amphiala) appear to have rapidly declined to rarity, possibly due to interference competition with endemic island foxes (Urocyon littoralis). Niche partitioning is expected in response to interference competition; hence, it is surprising that skunks and foxes show extensive overlap in macrohabitat use and circadian activity. However, the role of microhabitat associations and fine-scale temporal activity in facilitating coexistence of the two species has not been explored. We evaluated microhabitat associations of island spotted skunks and island foxes across both islands using data from live traps and wildlife cameras collected during 2015-2017, and we analyzed fine-scale temporal activity using camera data from 2016 and 2017. On both islands, skunks had a positive response to ground-level cover provided by rugged topography or woody vegetation such as shrubs or trees, whereas foxes had a weak or negative response, suggesting partitioning of these microhabitat characteristics. Additionally, on both islands the peak in timing of skunk activity offset the peak for foxes, which implies that skunks use fine-scale adjustments in activity to avoid foxes. Past grazing by exotic herbivores likely reduced habitat refuges for skunks; however, as vegetation on both islands recovers, regrowth of shrubs and trees may provide cover that will improve prospects for coexistence of island spotted skunks and island foxes.

AB  - Fencing to contain livestock movement, demarcate properties, and protect economic assets has been one of the main factors restricting wildlife movement. However, research assessing the impact of fences on large mammals in southern South America is scarce. We modified livestock fences by clipping the bottom wire to enable endangered huemul deer (Hippocamelus bisulcus) to cross in and out of forest plantations. Huemul showed a preference for crossing through areas where bottom wire strands had been removed. There was also a greater crossing frequency for fences located at lower elevation. Implementation of this simple management technique increased the availability of crossing areas, thereby facilitating huemul movement. Further fence modifications must seek to improve conditions of intervening habitat where huemul live and move, and thus prevent further population decline of this threatened species.

AB  - Introduction: Evidence suggests that herbivores, such as peccaries, shape vegetation structure and diversity through predation, trampling, dispersal, and rooting behavior. Objective: To evaluate the impact of peccaries (Dycotiles tajacu) on the understory vegetation of the tropical rainforest in the Nogal-La Selva Local Biological Corridor, Costa Rica, comparing a site with the absence of peccaries to another with the presence of these animals. Methodology: From June to November 2021, 20 experimental exclusions and 20 free access plots, each measuring 2 m(2) were used to quantify herbivory, the number of leaf blades, damaged leaves, healthy leaves, sapling height, and fallen biomass at both sites. Results: A higher sapling density was found in the Nogal Reserve, but a lower sapling diversity, while in La Selva there was a higher sapling diversity, but a lower density of seedlings. Herbivory and sapling height in La Selva exceeded those in Nogal. The exclusion of peccaries reduced seedling damage but did not affect the dynamics of fallen biomass. Conclusion: For the design, implementation, and evaluation of the effectiveness of biological corridors, it is crucial to consider plant -animal interactions to enhance the flow of ecological processes through functional and structural connectivity, analyzed from interactions such as those presented in this paper.

AB  - Non-native plants can significantly affect biodiversity and ecological functions of local ecosystems. The effects of Kandelia obovata introduction and Spartina alterniflora invasion on benthic bacterial communities, predicted ecological functions and interactions between macrobenthos and microorganisms were studied. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used to investigate the bacterial communities in sediments covered by S. alterniflora and K. obovata at different stand ages. Bacterial communities showed obvious spatial variation. With increasing in planting age, K. obovate sediments were occupied by higher proportions of bacteria involved in degradation of organic carbon compounds, including various sulfate reduction bacteria, Bacteroidetes, Alphaproteobacteria, and pathogenic bacteria Vibrio, while the relative abundances of Actinomatinales and Sulfurovum were more abundant in younger K. obovate sites. Compared to adjacent mudflat, higher abundances of sulfate reduction bacteria were observed in S. alterniflora. This study indicated that K. obovata introduction had greater effects on bacterial communities, and sediment pH, grain size, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and total phosphorus contents were main environmental factors affecting variation in bacterial communities. Tax4fun analysis further suggested that higher potentials of nitrogen fixation and dissimilatory sulfate reduction were observed after K. obovata restoration and S. alterniflora invasion. There were significant correlations between macrobenthos and bacterial communities, especially variations in relative abundance of infaunas and herbivores after K. obovata introduction and S. alterniflora invasion, which significantly affected bacterial communities and potentials involved in nitrogen cycling. The present study provided valuable information in scientific assessing the impacts of non-native plant disturbance on local ecosystems.

AB  - Modification of food webs is a frequent cause of shifts in ecosystem states that resist reversal when the food web is restored to its original condition. We used the restoration of the large carnivore guild including gray wolves (Canis lupis), cougars (Felis concolor), and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) to the northern range of Yellowstone National Park as a model system to understand how ecosystems might resist reconfiguration after the restoration of apex predators to the food web. The absence of wolves, cougars, and grizzly bears for nearly a century from the northern range was the primary cause of dramatic changes in riparian plant communities. Willows (Salix spp.) were suppressed in height by intense browsing by the dominant herbivore, elk (Cervus canadensis). The loss of activity by beavers (Castor canadensis) coincided with the loss of tall willows. We hypothesized that intense elk browsing interrupted the mutualism between willow and beavers: ecosystem engineering by beavers was a critical component of willow habitat and tall willows were a critical component of habitat for beavers. This interruption made riparian communities resilient to the disturbance caused by the restoration of apex predators. We hypothesized further that reductions in elk browsing attributable to reductions in elk population size were not sufficient to prevent the suppression of willow growth. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a 20-year, factorial experiment that crossed simulated beaver dams with the exclusion of browsing. We found that willows grew to heights expected for restored communities only in the presence of dams and reduced browsing. Willows experiencing ambient conditions remained well below this expectation. We found no difference in heights or growth rates of willows in experimental controls and willows in 21 randomly chosen sites, confirming that the results of the experiment were representative of range-wide conditions. A reorganized community of large herbivores was implicated in the suppression of willow growth. We conclude that the restoration of large carnivores to the food web failed to restore riparian plant communities on Yellowstone's northern range, supporting the hypothesis that this ecosystem is in an alternative stable state caused primarily by the extirpation of apex predators during the early 20th century.

AB  - We assessed vegetation cover density and distribution in Eastern Jordanian rangeland reserves (2411 km(2)) using a series of Landsat images (34 year's period) and ground cover survey (2020) to identify proper sites for reintroducing Arabian Oryx (Oryx leucoryx). The natural reserves were Burqu Nature Reserve site-1, and site-2 (Dmetheh), and Al Dahek Nature Reserve. Satellite sensor data from Landsat-8-OLI and Landsat- 5-TM were used to derive Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) between 1986 and 2020 and across growing seasons (March and April). The Dmetheh site had the highest vegetation cover density over the growing season and across years (1986-2020). Scattered shrubs and grasses (NDVI: 0.1-0.2) consistently covered more than 40% (600-700 km(2)) of the Dmetheh reserve, while in the other reserves vegetation cover were inconsistent and covered less than 500 km(2). Considering the Landsat- NDVI results, Dmetheh site was selected for further assessment. Ground survey of Dmetheh site showed that there were 54 palatable species (53% of total plants) and total ground vegetation cover (%) of the site in March was about 22.5%. The relationship between Landsat-NDVI values and ground vegetation cover was significant (R-2=73.3, P<0.001). Overall, remotely-sensed data hold promise for the assessment process of identifying proper sites to reintroduce Arabian Oryx in arid environments.

AB  - Two hypotheses have been used to explain the loss of plant diversity with nutrient addition. The nutrient identity hypothesis posits that biodiversity loss is due to a specific limiting nutrient, such as nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P), while the niche dimension hypothesis posits that adding a larger number of limiting nutrients, regardless of their identity, results in biodiversity loss. These two hypotheses have not previously been tested together simultaneously. Here, we conduct that analysis to enable their relative effect sizes to be compared. We manipulated the supply of eight nutrients in the same experimental meadow grassland site to isolate the effects of the identity of added nutrients versus the number of added nutrients on biodiversity loss. We found support for both hypotheses, with the largest negative effects on biodiversity measures being due to N, or N and P treatment, with additional more minor effects of the number of added nutrients. Structural equation models (SEMs) suggested both identity and number of added nutrients had direct negative effects on biodiversity, likely caused by species' innate ability to competitively respond to nutrients, especially in response to disease, herbivory, and stress. SEMs also suggested indirect effects arising from nutrient-driven increases in aboveground biomass, which resulted in intensified competition for light and the competitive exclusion of short-statured species. These effects were exacerbated by the nutrients N and P which caused a shift in biomass accumulation from belowground to aboveground. The results highlight that a multi-nutrient perspective will improve our ability to effectively manage, monitor, and restore ecosystems.

AB  - Although the exclusion effects of invertebrate decomposers on litter decomposition have been extensively studied in different experimental contexts, a thorough comparison of the exclusion effects of invertebrate decomposers with different body sizes on litter decomposition and its possible regulatory factors in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is still lacking. Here, through a meta-analysis of 1207 pairs of observations from 110 studies in terrestrial ecosystems and 473 pairs of observations from 60 studies in aquatic ecosystems, we found that invertebrate exclusion reduced litter decomposition rates by 36 % globally, 30 % in terrestrial ecosystems, and 44 % in aquatic ecosystems. At the global scale, the exclusion effects of macroinvertebrates and mesoinvertebrates on litter decomposition rates (reduced by 38 % and 36 %, respectively) were greater than those of the combination of macroinvertebrates and mesoinvertebrates (reduced by 30 %). In terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, the effects of invertebrate exclusion on litter decomposition rates were mainly regulated by climate and initial litter quality, but the effects of invertebrate exclusion with different body sizes were regulated differently by climate, initial litter quality, and abiotic environmental variables. These findings will help us better understand the role of invertebrate decomposers in litter decomposition, especially for invertebrate decomposers with different body sizes, and underscore the need to incorporate invertebrate decomposers with different body sizes into dynamic models of litter decomposition to examine the potential effects and regulatory mechanisms of land-water-atmosphere carbon fluxes.

AB  - Mangrove forests are prevalent along tropical/subtropical coastlines and provide valuable ecosystem services including coastline stabilization, storm impact reduction, and enhanced coastal productivity. However, mangroves were absent from the Hawaiian Islands and their introduction to Moloka'i in 1902 has provided an opportunity to examine their unique influence on coastal landscapes. Previous studies indicate an inability of native detritivores to utilize tannin-rich substrates, yielding poor cycling of mangrove-derived detritus in Hawaiian tidal zones. We hypothesize that in addition to altering detrital inputs, introduced mangroves facilitate the persistence of introduced species in the Hawaiian coastal zone by providing novel habitat for juvenile megafauna. To determine whether mangrove-dominated tidal zones harbor megafaunal assemblages distinct from open sandflats, we sampled in two mangrove (M1 and M2) and two adjacent sandflat (S1 and S2) sites along the southern coast of Moloka'i, where the most mature mangrove forests occur in Hawai'i. There were no statistical differences in total abundances between M1 and M2 or S1 and S2; therefore, results from individual deployments were pooled across the sites in order to conduct between-habitat (mangrove vs. sandflat) comparisons. Our mangrove study site had significantly higher abundances of megafauna, including several shrimp and crab species, compared to the sandflat site. The community composition within the mangrove site differed from the sandflat site, including higher abundances of non-native mangrove crabs (Scylla serrata), as well as native fish Bathygobius cocosensis and crustaceans (Thalamita crenata, Palaemon pacificus, P debilis) than in the sandflat site, indicating that the mangrove site may provide niches for both invasive and native species. In addition, mean body length for several similar species was smaller in the mangrove site than in the sandflat site, suggesting that these mangroves may be providing a habitat for juvenile species. While our study was spatially limited to two mangrove and two adjacent sandflat sites, our results suggest that introduced mangroves in Moloka'i may support small-bodied, native, and nonnative megafauna, influencing coastal Hawaiian trophic dynamics. Our case study provides a baseline for megafaunal fish and invertebrate communities present prior to non-native mangrove removal as well as for monitoring potential community changes following expansion of mangrove habitats due to climate change.

AB  - Mediterranean temporary ponds (MTPs) are seasonal wetland habitats usually flooded during the rainy season but drying out during the warmer months. Due to their biodiversity, uniqueness, and numerous threats, they are listed as a priority for conservation under the Habitats Directive. Despite all the efforts made so far, they are still in poor conservation status in the Mediterranean biogeographic region, making it urgent to define efficient conservation and restoration actions. In this work, we used two case studies to evaluate the conservation status improvement of MTPs located on the southwest coast of Portugal, following the implementation of different management techniques. Sampling was based on floristic surveys to assess plant richness and species frequency, namely of characteristic MTPs species. In the first case, we tested three management techniques (direct grazing, vegetation cutting, and biomass cut/removal, followed by topsoil plowing-simulating wild boar trampling and wallowing) in plots installed in three MTPs between 2017 and 2018. Plots subject to wild boar simulation disturbance showed higher species richness, higher frequency of characteristic species, and lower dominance of Agrostis stolonifera. In the second case, we upscaled this technique as an ecological restoration action by using it in 10 MTPs between 2018 and 2021. We observed a positive effect on the habitat's structure and conservation status, although the possible influence of recurrent drought periods in the last decade is discussed. This study provides insights into a rare wetland habitat based on lessons learned from hands-on conservation actions, while also identifying new challenges and knowledge gaps.

AB  - Context. Helicopter-based shooting has been widely used to harvest deer or control overabundant populations in Australasia, but the effectiveness and cost of this method as a deer control tool has seldom been evaluated. Aims. We evaluated the effectiveness and costs of helicopter-based shooting of fallow deer (Dama dama) and chital deer (Axis axis) in eastern Australia by quantifying (1) reductions in density, (2) the relationship between numbers killed per hour and deer density (i.e. the functional response), (3) the costs of control and (4) the effort-outcome and cost-outcome relationships. Methods. We evaluated the costs and effectiveness of 12 aerial shooting operations aiming to reduce fallow deer (n = 8) or chital deer (n = 4) population densities at nine sites in eastern Australia. Sites were characterised by fragmented woodland, and all but one operation aimed to reduce grazing competition with livestock. We used precontrol population density estimates and operational monitoring data to estimate the costs and outcomes of each operation. We combined data from all operations to estimate the relationship between shooting effort and population reduction, as well as costs associated with different levels of effort. Key results. Population reductions for operations ranged from 5% to 75% for fallow deer, and from 48% to 88% for chital deer. The greatest population reductions occurred when effort per unit area was greatest, and the largest reductions in deer density occurred when shooting was conducted in consecutive years. The functional response of hourly kills to deer density was best described by a modified Ivlev model, with the asymptotic kill rate estimated to be 50 deer per hour. There was no support for the existence of a prey refuge, that is, a threshold population density below which no deer could be shot. Helicopter charter was the primary cost of helicopter-based shooting programs, followed by labour; firearm and ammunition costs were relatively minor. Conclusions. Helicopter-based shooting can rapidly reduce deer populations over large geographic areas, but the magnitude of the reduction depends on the effort (hours of shooting) per deer per km(2). Implications. Aerial shooting operations should include a pre-control population survey so that (1) measurable objectives can be established, (2) the likely level of effort and cost required for objectives to be met can be estimated and planned for, and (3) the realised population reduction can be estimated.

AB  - Red and roe deer are the most numerous cervids in Europe, and they occur in sympatry in most regions. Roe deer were considered to be an inferior competitor in studies in which they co-occurred with fallow deer or muntjac. Despite the remarkable overlap of their ranges, there are few studies on the competition between the red and roe deer. Since interspecific interactions among ungulates are often related to their mutual densities, the current study focused on the effects of high red deer density on the roe deer numbers and spatial distribution in the unhunted Slowinski National Park (SNP) in northern Poland and forest districts open to hunting bordering the park. Using fecal pellet group counts, it was found that in the forest districts (where red deer densities were 2-3 times lower than in the SNP), roe deer densities were significantly higher than in the park. The red-to-roe deer density ratio was 10.8 and 2.7, in the SNP and the surrounding forest districts, respectively. Moreover, in the SNP, the roe deer distribution was negatively affected by the red deer habitat use, while in the hunting areas, such an effect was not recorded. The negative influence of the red deer on the roe deer population in the park was most probably due to the red deer impact on food availability. The biomass of the plant groups forming the staple food of the roe deer (Rubus spp., forbs, dwarf shrubs) was significantly higher in the fenced plots than in the unfenced ones. Lack of hunting in the protected areas may benefit only some species in ungulate assemblages which, in turn, may contradict one of their objectives-to maintain viable and ecologically functional populations.

AB  - Spatial and temporal patterns of benthic community structure play a crucial role in shaping reef habitats and have a direct impact on fish foraging dynamics, alongside density-dependent effects on the whole community. At isolated oceanic islands, the relatively low fish species richness often leads to the hyperdominance of a few species and a general reduced trophic redundancy. However, the influence of benthic habitat features and hyperdominant species on foraging selection at oceanic islands has been largely overlooked. We used remote underwater videos (RUVs) to investigate whether reef fishes consistently forage on specific habitats across 5 different oceanic islands in the Atlantic Ocean, especially focusing on the importance of the role of hyperdominant species. We analysed 295 RUVs, within 2 m2 areas (3-15 m deep), totalling 49 h of video. Photoquadrats were utilised to gauge benthic group coverage in the same habitats. Our results revealed 5 prevalent habitats and 6 fish trophic groups interacting with reef benthos. The intensity of feeding pressure varied across islands, depending on the diversity of habitats. Herbivores and omnivores exhibited the highest feeding pressure, with omnivores foraging on crustose coralline algae and macroalgae habitats, while herbivores primarily fed on habitats dominated by the epilithic algal matrix. Hyperdominant species forage in multiple habitats, indicating a comparatively high degree of dietary plasticity. Our findings also demonstrated that fish feeding pressure is influenced by both habitat features and fish biomass. Therefore, our study can provide valuable insights for prioritising the management of key species in isolated oceanic reefs.

AB  - While the coral reefs in the Persian Gulf have adapted to withstand some of the most challenging environmental conditions, overfishing and eutrophication can disrupt the structure of their associated biofouling assemblages. In the present study, the effects of reduced grazing pressure and eutrophication on the assemblage structure of biofouling functional groups in the coral reefs of Hengam Island (Persian Gulf) was investigated using a 21-month manipulative experiment utilizing settlement tiles. A total of 40 biofouling taxa were identified, none of which belonged to reef-building corals or the key facilitators of coral settlement. The effect of grazers on cover percentage was overshadowed by nutrient enrichment; suggesting a bottom-up control mechanism rather than top-down regulation in the coral ecosystem of the island. Our results suggest that grazers can reduce the coral-competing functional groups only in the absence of other confounding factors such as nutrient pollution

AB  - The Antarctic Peninsula is one of the most rapidly warming regions on earth, and it is likely that the abundance and distribution of marine predators will change as a result. Procellariiform seabirds are highly mobile predators, which target specific habitat characteristics associated with underlying distributions of prey and areas of increased prey availability. We use ship surveys and hurdle models, to estimate the summer distribution and relative density of 11 seabird species within the northern Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem. Models differed among species; however, sea surface temperature and depth were frequently associated with seabird occurrence and had the greatest explanatory power across many species. Null models based on observation data were better at predicting seabird density than models that included environmental covariates. This suggests that the main driver of distribution patterns is the broad-scale habitat features, and fine-scale aggregations within these ranges are harder to predict. Our seabird distribution models reflect known habitat associations, species hotspots, and community organization relative to oceanic and coastal marine processes. Application of species distribution models will benefit the assessments of critical habitat and potential responses to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance, which will provide insight into how species may change in polar ecosystems.

AB  - Formally protected areas are an important component of wildlife conservation, but face limitations in their effectiveness for migratory species. Improved stewardship of working lands around protected areas is one so-lution for conservation planning, but private working lands are vulnerable to development. In the Greater Yel-lowstone Ecosystem (GYE), ungulates such as elk (Cervus canadensis) use both protected areas and private lands throughout their annual migrations. We studied patterns of landownership, protection, and conservation chal-lenges within the ranges of migratory elk in the GYE. We used GPS data from 1088 elk in 26 herds to define herd -level seasonal ranges, and extracted covariates related to landownership and protection, land use, and human infrastructure and development. All elk herds used land encompassing >1 ownership type. Most elk herds (92.3 % of herds, n = 24) used the highest proportion of private land in the winter (mean = 36.2 % private land). Most elk herds' winter ranges contained the highest building densities (mean = 1.24 buildings/km2), fence densities (mean = 1.02 km fence/km2), and cattle grazing (mean = 1.9 cows/km2), compared to migratory and summer ranges. Out of all ranges, 36.5 % of ranges did not have any zoning regulations, indicating the potential for future development. Our results show that elk in the GYE rely on habitat outside of protected areas, and face landscape -scale conservation challenges such as habitat fragmentation from human development, particularly in winter ranges. Future conservation strategies for wildlife in this system need to encompass coordination across both public and private land to ensure migratory connectivity.

AB  - Palaeoecological and archaeological reconstructions using stable isotopes rely on understanding isotopic processes in modern ecosystems. This study examines how sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon isotope values (S34S, S15N, and S13C) of modern plains and wood bison (Bison bison bison and Bison bison athabascae) hair records foraging selectivity and size-related metabolic differences in a C3-dominated mixed woodland environment: Elk Island National Park (EINP), Alberta, Canada. Terrestrial grasses on the margins of wetlands in EINP had substantially lower S34S and higher S15N than grasses in dry environments, signalling the potential for modern and ancient herbivore tissue S34S and S15N values to record wetland versus dryland foraging. Bison hair S34S and S15N differed between wood and plains bison subspecies, with lower S34S and higher S15N values in wood bison hair suggesting they consumed more plants growing in wetland habitats. Adult females and juveniles consumed a greater proportion of wetland plants than adult males, reflecting differential group dynamics and foraging decisions. Bison body size was positively (linearly) correlated with hair S13C and negatively (non-linearly) correlated with hair S15N, but uncorrelated with hair S34S. We hypothesize that increased body size requires greater reliance on gut microbial proteins to build body tissues (increasing hair S13C), and that larger-bodied individuals have greater nitrogen use efficiency and lower-quality diets (decreasing hair S15N). Our results suggest that (palaeo)ecological and archaeological researchers should consider the extent to which habitat selectivity and metabolic effects related to sex, age and body size can influence herbivore tissue isotopic compositions.

AB  - The widespread introduction of non-native fishes has contributed to freshwater ecosystems being considered among the most altered ecosystems globally. Of particular concern are invasive planktivorous fishes (e.g., silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and bighead carp H. nobilis, collectively known as bigheaded carps) that have the potential to modify basal food web structure and compete for planktonic resources with native planktivores and young-of-year fishes. Bigheaded carps have proliferated throughout the Mississippi River basin, creating an outsized potential for resource competition with native fishes. Studies have showed niche overlap between bigheaded carps and native planktivores is generally high but that overlap varies among rivers. Importantly, niche overlap has not been assessed for density extremes of bigheaded carps within a river to determine whether trophic niches changed as a result of the invasion. The objectives of this study were to determine whether (1) silver and/or bighead carps share a similar isotopic niche with four native planktivores, and (2) that association varies ecologically (i.e., low- and high-densities of bigheaded carps) and spatially (i.e., between rivers). Our results generally show high trophic overlap among species, suggesting potential direct resource competition. Niche overlap was higher in study reaches with low densities of bigheaded carps compared to reaches with high densities, presumably due to intense resource competition and limiting of resources under high densities of bigheaded carps. Across density extremes, trophic reorganization by bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus) was divergent from other native planktivores. Species-specific responses may be due to subtle differences in feeding strategies, degree of planktivory, food selectivity, and correlated food size distributions.

AB  - Grasslands are among the most utilised habitat types for livestock production and the least protected ecosystems globally. Livestock grazing alters the abiotic and biotic features of a landscape and influences vegetation structure. In turn, these vegetation structural changes can adversely impact native animals that use these habitats, including reptiles. The endangered pygmy bluetongue lizard (Tiliqua adelaidensis) exclusively inhabits livestock-grazed grasslands in South Australia. Using a before/after, control/impact design, we investigated the effects of short-term grazing exclusion on vegetation structure and lizard abundance across two sites with natural vegetation and climate variation. We found vegetation structure differed between the two sites in "before" and "after" data but did not detect any effect of grazing treatment. We detected a negative association of lizard abundance with tussock cover in "before" data and a negative association with bare ground in the "after" data at the more arid site (Peterborough), although there was no significant overall grazing exclusion effect on lizard abundance at either site. Our survey techniques at a site scale may not have captured microhabitat-scale changes that could have influenced pygmy bluetongue responses. This study indicates short-term and small spatial scale grazing exclusion will have non-significant effects on pygmy bluetongues. Sheep grazing management is an important component of pygmy bluetongue conservation, and we recommend further research to incorporate multiple spatial scales over a longer time prior to applying landscape management actions.

AB  - Introduction: Seasonally dry tropical forests are subject to chronic degradation processes, which has reduced the populations of some important animal dispersers. Intensive livestock farming within the forest remnants is considered one of the main causes of these degradation processes. However, domestic ungulates could also be fulfilling the role of seed dispersal for some wild species. Objective: To evaluate the role of goats as seed dispersers of woody species and the possible consequences of their feeding behavior on the vegetation structure. Methods: Between December 2016 and June 2017, we collected goat feces from pens (N = 38) and vegetation plots (N = 42) from three locations of dry forest in the Southwestern Ecuador. All the seeds found in the feces (N = 13 326) were recorded and taxonomically identified. To evaluate the effect of gut passage on seed germination, we sowed the seeds found in the goat feces from the pens and seeds collected directly from parent plants. Results: Goats dispersed seeds from ten species, of which at least 50 % are legumes. Acacia macracantha seeds represented ca. 70 % of seeds present in goat feces. The passage of seeds through the digestive tract of goats significantly improved the percentage and speed of germination in Albizia multiflora, Piscidia carthagenensis and Ziziphus thyrsiflora, while in Choroleucon mangense and Prosopis juliflora no germination was registered. We did not find a correlation between the richness of established trees and the number of species found in the goat feces (chi(2) = -0.23, P = 0.53). The composition of dispersed seed species in the feces did not show a dependency on the locality, although the composition of the established vegetation changes between localities. The frequency of seeds in the feces did not show a relationship with the tree abundance in the established vegetation. Conclusions: Goats can play, at least partially, the role of locally extinct wild ungulates, improving the germination of legume species with hard coat. However, this positive effect can be blurred by their feeding behavior and high preference for particular species, which can modify the dominance of some species, and result in changes in the composition and structure of the vegetation.

The level of protection is key factor influencing the marine biodiversity, where a more enforced protection is expected to drive positive outcomes. In 2008, a large MPAs network (-11,380 km(2)) was established in one of off the most populated and industrialized areas in the world (i.e., Sao Paulo State coast, southeast Brazil). Given many goods and services provided by marine ecosystems, this MPA network represents the most challenging marine conservation initiative in Brazil. Harboring areas with different socio-ecological contexts and management regimes, this MPA network provides a unique opportunity to investigate the effects of cumulative impacts. We contrasted the biomass and size structure of reef fish in three subtropical islands under different levels of enforcement. We analyzed the influence of variables as island size, benthic cover, depth, topographic complexity, wave exposure, and protection level on the biomass of reef fish assemblages. Protection level was the main attribute responsible to explain the high biomass of fish target species and small territorial herbivores. In sites sheltered from the waves, the biomass of groupers was -1600% higher within enforced area than that from open-access area. Beyond the idea of positive effects of enforcement on reef fish biomass and size, we add evidences that even under multiple stressors, the area-based management is still a strong tool to marine conservation.

AB  - The introduction of artificial nighttime lighting due to human settlements and transport networks is increasingly altering the timing, intensity, and spectra of natural light regimes worldwide. Much of the research on the impacts of nighttime light pollution on organisms has focused on animal species. Little is known about the impacts of daylength extension due to outdoor lighting technologies on wild plant communities, despite the fact that plant growth and development are under photoperiodic control. In a five-year field experiment, artificial ecosystems ("mesocosms") of grassland communities both alone or in combination with invertebrate herbivores and predators were exposed to light treatments that simulated street lighting technologies (low-pressure sodium, and light-emitting diode [LED]-based white lighting), at ground-level illuminance. Most of the plant species in the mesocosms did not exhibit changes in biomass accumulation after 5 years of exposure to the light treatments. However, the white LED treatment had a significant negative effect on biomass production in the herbaceous species Lotus pedunculatus. Likewise, the interaction between the white LED treatment and the presence of herbivores significantly reduced the mean shoot/root ratio of the grass species Holcus lanatus. Artificial nighttime lighting had no effect on the foliar carbon or nitrogen in most of the grassland species. Nevertheless, the white LED treatment significantly increased the leaf nitrogen content in Lotus corniculatus in the presence of herbivores. Long-term exposure to artificial light at night had no general effects on plant biomass responses in experimental grassland communities. However, species-specific and negative effects of cool white LED lighting at ground-level illuminance on biomass production and allocation in mixed plant communities are suggested by our findings. Further studies on the impacts of light pollution on biomass accumulation in plant communities are required as these effects could be mediated by different factors, including herbivory, competition, and soil nutrient availability.

AB  - Reindeer, called caribou in North America, has a circumpolar distribution and all extant populations belong to the same species (Rangifer tarandus). It has survived the Holocene thanks to its immense adaptability and successful coexistence with humans in different forms of hunting and herding cultures. Here, we examine the paternal and maternal history of Rangifer based on robust Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) trees representing Eurasian tundra reindeer, Finnish forest reindeer, Svalbard reindeer, Alaska tundra caribou, and woodland caribou. We first assembled Y-chromosomal contigs, representing 1.3 Mb of single-copy Y regions. Based on 545 Y-chromosomal and 458 mtDNA SNPs defined in 55 males, maximum parsimony trees were created. We observed two well separated clades in both phylogenies: the "EuroBeringian clade" formed by animals from Arctic Islands, Eurasia, and a few from North America and the "North American clade" formed only by caribou from North America. The time calibrated Y tree revealed an expansion and dispersal of lineages across continents after the Last Glacial Maximum. We show for the first time unique paternal lineages in Svalbard reindeer and Finnish forest reindeer and reveal a circumscribed Y haplogroup in Fennoscandian tundra reindeer. The Y chromosome in domesticated reindeer is markedly diverse indicating that several male lineages have undergone domestication and less intensive selection on males. This study places R. tarandus onto the list of species with resolved Y and mtDNA phylogenies and builds the basis for studies of the distribution and origin of paternal and maternal lineages in the future.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Salvia pratensis L. (Meadow Clary) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Salvia pratensis is an erect, rosette-forming, perennial herb with a broad native distribution covering much of Europe-from the British Isles, Spain and Morocco in the west, across Europe into Asia, as far east as the Urals. In the British Isles, the species is nationally scarce, confined to a few south- to west-facing sites with calcareous soils in Southern England and one site in Wales. It is predominately found in unimproved pasture, hay meadows and grassy verges, but can occur on the fringes of scrub or woodland. Although the species is abundant in central Europe, changes to land management since the mid-20th century have resulted in fragmented and threatened populations in several European countries. It is cultivated as an ornamental, as is S. x sylvestris, the hybrid with S. nemorosa. Populations are typically gynodioecious, having both female (male-sterile) and hermaphrodite individuals at variable proportions. The species has a mixed mating system and is self-compatible via insect pollination, but predominantly outcrosses. Honeybees and bumblebees are abundant pollinators, but a diverse range of bee species and other insect species visit S. pratensis flowers. Inbreeding depression has been documented, presenting a conservation concern for small, fragmented populations. The species is the focus of conservation efforts and has been reintroduced to sites where it had become locally extinct in Britain. To sustain favourable habitat, site management should maintain low soil nutrient levels, and prevent scrub encroachment and the dominance of coarse grasses. The removal of sward by hay cutting or grazing after plants have flowered and set seed is advised, in addition to maintaining a degree of disturbance to provide bare patches of soil for seedling recruitment.

AB  - To test the effect of reindeer husbandry on soil carbon storage of seasonally frozen ground, we analysed soil and vegetation properties in peatlands and mixed pine and mountain birch forests. We analysed sites with no grazing and contrasting intensities of grazing, and associated trampling, in Northern Finland. With a pilot study approach, we optimised the study design to include several grazing class sites including grazing seasonality but omitting sample replication at one site. Soils were analysed for water content, bulk density, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen, stable carbon isotopes and radiocarbon ages. We found that there was no significant difference between grazing intensities in terms of TOC, but that TOC mainly depended on the soils' TOC content present prior to intensive herbivory introduction. In contrast, understory vegetation was visibly transformed from dwarf shrub to graminoid-dominated vegetation with increasing grazing and trampling intensity. Also, we found a decrease in bulk density with increasing animal activity on soil sites, which most likely results from named vegetation changes and therefore different peat structures.

AB  - Ecological carrying capacity (ECC), as an efficient approach in sustainable management, also was used to indicate ecosystem stability in vulnerable ecoregions. In this study, we proposed a new framework of ECC quantification focusing on vulnerable ecoregions and analyzed ECC on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) based on the ecogeographical regionalization. Some indicators were introduced in ECC assessing, such as effective vegetation cover required to make soil water erosion lower than the threshold of soil loss (EVCwater), effective vegetation cover required to make soil wind erosion lower than the threshold of soil loss (EVCwind), and aboveground net primary production that can be used for human activities (UANPP). The results showed that: (1) EVCwater increased from northwest to southeast on the QTP, and exceeded 70% in the southeastern QTP; (2) EVCwind for the entire Qinghai-Tibet Plateau increased from southeast to northwest, and was < 30% in most areas of the eastern QTP; (3) the UANPP in most study areas ranged from 0 to 408.69 g m- 2 yr-1, with a regional average of 95.06 g m- 2 yr-1, and areas with a UANPP < 0 g m- 2 yr-1 were mainly distributed in the HID1 ecoregion; and (4) the average ECC for alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is 1.47 sheep unit hm-2, although values increased gradually from northwest to southeast.

AB  - Context. Coastal beach environments provide habitats for marine megafauna, including turtles, rays, marine mammals and sharks. However, accessing these variable energy zones has been difficult for researchers by using traditional methods. Aims. This study used drone-based aerial surveys to assess spatio-temporal variation of marine megafauna across south-eastern Queensland, Australia. Methods. Drones were operated at five south-eastern Queensland beaches. Megafauna sightings and key variables including location, month and turbidity were analysed to assess variation across locations. Key results Overall, 3815 individual megafauna were detected from 3273 flights. There were significant differences in the composition of megafauna assemblages throughout the year and among beaches, with megafaunal sightings in >80% of flights conducted off North Stradbroke Island. Conclusions. Strong temporal presence was found that is congruent with other studies examining seasonality. This supports the use of drones to provide ecological data for many hard-to-study megafauna species and help inform long-term sustainable management of coastal ecosystems. Implications Results indicated that environmental conditions can influence the probability of sighting marine megafauna during aerial surveys.

AB  - Extensive livestock production and urbanization entail modifications of natural landscapes, including installation of fences, development of agriculture, urbanization of natural areas, and construction of roads and infrastructure that, together, impact native fauna. Here, we evaluate the diversity and genetic structure of endemic guanacos (Lama guanicoe) of the Monte and Patagonian Steppe of central Argentina, which have been reduced and displaced by sheep ranching and other impacts of human activities. Analyses of genetic variation of microsatellite loci and d-loop revealed high levels of genetic variation and latitudinal segregation of mitochondrial haplotypes. There were indications of at least two historical populations in the Monte and the Patagonian Steppe based on shared haplotypes and shared demographic history among localities. Currently, guanacos are structured into three groups that were probably reconnected relatively recently, possibly facilitated by a reduction of sheep and livestock in recent decades and a recovery of the guanaco populations. These results provide evidence of the genetic effects of livestock activity and urbanization on wild herbivore populations, which were possibly exacerbated by an arid environment with limited productive areas. The results highlight the importance of enacting conservation management plans to ensure the persistence of ancestral and ecologically functional populations of guanacos.

AB  - Savannahs are often branded by livestock grazing with resulting land degradation. Holistic management of livestock was proposed to contribute to biodiversity conservation by simulating native wildlife grazing behaviour. This study attempts the comparison of the impact of a holistic management regime to a wildlife grazing management regime on grass and ground-dwelling beetle species diversity on neighboring farms in Namibian rangeland. Results show that the response of biodiversity in species richness and composition to holistic management of livestock differs substantially from wildlife grazing with a positive impact. From a total of 39 identified species of ground-dwelling beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae, Carabidae) from 29 genera, eight species were found to be indicators for holistic management of livestock and three were found to be indicators for wildlife grazed rangeland. Observations suggest that holistic management of livestock may contribute to biodiversity conservation, but the differential effect of grazing management on species assemblages suggests that livestock grazing cannot replace native wildlife herbivory. Implications for insect conservation An adaptive management strategy such as holistic management used in this study shows the potential to support high beetle biodiversity. Holistic management of livestock thus aspects in favour for a sustainable form of grazing management for insect conservation even though it does not functionally replace grazing by native wildlife.

AB  - Knowledge of the diet ecology of apex predators in insular island ecosystems has direct applications to the conservation of endemic species at risk of extinction. We used stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to infer resource-use strategies of an indigenous predator, the Pacific marten (Marks caurina (Merriam, 1890)), in a highly modified ecosystem on Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, Canada. We used Bayesian isotopic mixing models to estimate the relative contributions of different food sources to marten diet across seasons and during overall lifetime, and to determine how diet varied with different levels of access to marine resources. Isotopes of carbon and nitrogen measured in hair and muscle tissue suggested that marten consumed salmon (3%-17%) and berries (25%-37%) seasonally; these diet groups were relatively minor components of the lifetime diet. Analysis of bone collagen suggested that terrestrial fauna - including birds, deer, small mammals, and invertebrates - contributed the most to diet (41%-55%), and marine invertebrates (38%-48%), not salmon (0%-3%), were the main allochthonous marine nutrient subsidy to lifetime diet. Plasticity in foraging ecology, combined with a broad dietary niche, introduced prey, notably the invasive Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis Merriam, 1898), as well as abundant marine resources, may allow marten to outcompete other indigenous and endemic carnivores on Haida Gwaii.

AB  - Invertebrate-derived DNA (iDNA) has been successfully utilized for surveying mammalian biodiversity in several ecosystems. Yet, as with all sampling methods, this approach suffers from potential biases, including those introduced by the choice of invertebrate sampler, as well as the stochasticity of DNA amplification during PCR. Occupancy modeling is a statistical framework that can help account for imperfect detections in sampling and can be used to improve iDNA surveys. Using a case study based on the DNA screened from the blood meals of leeches, we demonstrate how multiscale occupancy models can be applied to the molecular detection of vertebrates to reveal the nuances in iDNA detections. Leeches were collected across a habitat degradation gradient in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, in 2015 and 2016. We estimated three probabilities describing the occupancy, availability, and detection of three abundant mammals (bearded pig, muntjac and sambar deer) and compared how these values were impacted by environmental and technical covariates. For 2015, we found that null models without covariates revealed no clear differences in each of the three probabilities across taxa. However, in 2016, although the taxa have comparable occupancy, deviations occurred in the other two probabilities, with the sambar deer showing the lowest availability and muntjac with the lowest detection probability. Univariate models constructed for each taxon and year revealed differential impacts of the covariates; for example, a strong positive effect of DNA concentration on the detection of sambar deer and bearded pig was seen in 2016 only. Finally, our estimation of the minimum numbers of biological and technical replicates highlights the important trade-off between achieving high probabilities of availability and detection and realistic amounts of sampling. Our results showcase the use of occupancy models for leech-iDNA biodiversity surveys but highlight the potential effects of sample type, methodological design, and sample size.

AB  - Tree cavities are an essential resource for cavity-dwelling mammals, birds, invertebrates and fungi, and so are important for maintaining forest biodiversity. In North American forests, woodpeckers (Picidae) play a keystone role in cavity creation by excavating holes. However, in European forests many hole-nesting songbirds rely on non-excavated cavities that are formed by fungal decay and compartmentalization after tree damage. Several factors are recognised in initiating non-excavated cavities that are used by hole-nesting birds, including loss of a tree branch or stem breakage, but this topic is poorly studied. Here, we propose that bark stripping by large herbivores (e.g. Red Deer Cervus elaphus and European Bison Bison bonasus) could be another important, and previously overlooked, mechanism for initiating tree cavities that are used by hole-nesting birds. We suggest that, after the initial damage from herbivore bark-stripping, fungal decay can create specific elongated, slit-like cavities, which are particularly important as nest sites for some common forest songbirds. We outline this idea using original observations and evidence from the literature, primarily from the primeval forest in Poland's Bialowieza National Park. We also use studies from elsewhere in Europe to show a generally low usage of slit cavities by birds where large herbivores are scarce or absent. We suggest that restoring such animals in European forests could help to restore the abundance and diversity of the tree cavity resource for hole-dwelling species. We encourage future research to investigate this proposal of large herbivores being important agents of tree cavity formation that could enhance biodiversity.

AB  - In dry climates, livestock farming contributes to waterhole creation and maintenance, thereby contributing to biodiversity conservation. However, these lentic water bodies also represent a critical environmental connection between microorganisms and their vertebrate hosts since the water can facilitate pathogen persistence and transmission. Therefore, interventions for tuberculosis (TB) risk mitigation at the wildlife-livestock interface often focus on segregating host species at water points. We hypothesized that waterhole characteristics modulate their use by vertebrates and subsequent pathogen exposure risk. We visited 298 waterholes on 80 TB-positive and 40 TB-negative cattle farms in Spain to assess differences in waterhole characteristics and identify possible management implications. There was an average of 2.7 waterholes per farm. This represents 0.02 waterholes per km(2) of farmland and 3.5 m(2) of lentic waterbodies per km(2) of farmland. Among the studied waterholes, 95% were man-made. Waterholes on TB-positive farms were 42% closer to covering vegetation than waterholes located on TB-negative ones. Farms with man-made waterholes showed a higher risk of TB than those with natural ones. The density of waterholes per surface unit was negatively associated with the farm TB risk. Waterholes placed on TB-positive farms were more intensively trampled by livestock. The best model explained farm positivity to TB as a function of the distance from the waterholes to the nearest cover vegetation, the aquatic vegetation richness found in the waterhole, the intensity of livestock use (trampling), the surrounding waterhole density, and the interaction between waterhole perimeter and the total number of signs of potential wildlife TB hosts per waterhole. Identifying the key waterhole features related to infection risk might allow designing One Health-inspired biosecurity measures such as increasing the number of waterholes, placing new waterholes farther away from cover, or fencing-out cattle from wildlife-rich waterholes to balance biodiversity conservation and animal health needs in extensive grazing systems.

AB  - Forest tree diversity helps shape the assembly of herbivorous insect communities in forests worldwide, and Island biogeography theory explains the role of tree range area as a driver of variation in native insect richness per tree species. However, it is unclear if these biogeographical principles apply to non-native insect herbivores. We created an extensive list of tree-insect associations for tree species native to Palearctic Europe bioregion, and investigated how both native and non-native insect herbivore species richness per tree may be influenced by various factors including the range area of the tree and the tree type (conifer or angiosperm). Models were further subsetted to compare drivers for the richness of different feeding guilds (folivores, sap feeders or wood borers) and host breadth (specialist or generalist). Tree range area had a positive effect on native, but not non-native, insect species richness per tree, while non-native richness was affected by host type and had a positive correlation with native herbivore richness on the same tree species. Host breadth grouping did not influence the difference in the effect of tree range on native versus non-native insect richness, but native folivores had a stronger relationship with range distribution area compared to the other groups. We conclude that the assembly of non-native herbivorous insect species on trees occurs through fundamentally different mechanisms than the co-evolutionary processes proposed by the framework of Island biogeography theory.

AB  - Island populations of small land vertebrates frequently exhibit insular gigantism, presenting with larger body sizes in comparison to mainland counterparts. While insular gigantism has been observed globally, the effects of biogeographic and ecological factors on body size in island systems are not well understood. Here, we examine the biogeographic and ecological associations of insular gigantism. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) were live trapped and body mass measured on six of the Gulf Islands and the nearby mainland of British Columbia, Canada. Biogeographic measures of land area and island distance from the mainland and the ecological measure of predator species richness were used in piecewise structural equation modelling to identify associations with insular gigantism. We found evidence of insular gigantism in the Gulf Islands system, with island mice having a larger mean body mass than mainland populations. Land area was positively associated with predator species richness, and predator species richness had a strong negative effect on deer mouse body mass, resulting in the observed pattern of insular gigantism. The concurrent analysis of biogeographic and ecological factors contributes to a better understanding of the evolution of insular gigantism in small vertebrates and its juxtaposition to the phenomenon of insular dwarfism of large vertebrates.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the main drivers of biotic homogenization in bird communities worldwide. Yet, only a few studies have addressed its functional consequences on the top-down control birds exert on insect herbivores. We hypothesized that their inconsistent results reflect the overlooked heterogeneity of the urban habitat for birds, and in particular the distribution and diversity of urban trees. We monitored tree diversity, bird diversity, avian predation attempts on artificial prey, and the effect of bird exclusion on insect herbivory in 97 trees distributed among 24 urban experimental plots in the city of Montreal, Canada. We characterized urbanization levels through a combination of variables related to tree density, impervious surfaces, anthropic noise, and human population density. Bird diversity decreased with increasing urbanization, whereas the frequency of generalist synurbic species increased. We found no significant relationship between predation and urbanization or between predation and bird diversity. However, tree diversity was positively correlated with predation attempts on artificial prey, irrespective of bird diversity. We revealed a mismatch between the effects of urbanization on bird diversity and on the regulation service and unraveled the functional importance of tree diversity in shaping the avian predation function in urban ecosystems. Our study advocates for the consideration of intra-urban heterogeneity in the investigation of trophic cascades within cities.

AB  - Context. A wild population of non-native hog deer has established in the Gippsland region of Victoria, Australia, and there is particular concern about its impact on native vegetation in Wilsons Promontory National Park (WPNP). Since 2015, there has been annual culling of hog deer at WPNP to reduce deer abundances and impacts. Aims. The aims of this study were to use a kinship approach based on genotyping to assess contemporary dispersal of hog deer across WPNP, by identifying close kin, to determine whether dispersal of deer into culled sites from unculled sites may affect the long-term success of management there. Differences in the dispersal of male and female hog deer were also investigated. Methods. In total, 91 hog deer tissue samples were collected across WPNP and surrounding sites. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were sequenced, and a final dataset comprising 8275 SNPs was used for analysis. First-order, second-order, and intermediate relative pairs were identified, and the geographic distance between these pairs was assessed to determine inter-pair distances to infer dispersal. Spatial autocorrelation between male and female samples was evaluated to measure the effects of sex-biased dispersal. Key results. Only seven second-order relative pairs were found across different sites, with a 30 km distance between the furthest pair observed. However, most inter-pair distances across sites were similar to 5-10 km. Analyses of sex-biased dispersal showed that movement by deer was not strongly influenced by one sex. Conclusions. Although hog deer in WPNP are genetically similar, most relatives that were sampled were not widely dispersed. This suggests that there is limited dispersal of hog deer across this park. Implications. Recolonisation of hog deer at culled sites via dispersal is likely to be infrequent in WPNP. Kinship analysis provides an effective method of assessing contemporary dispersal and could be applied to other species to assess fine-scale movement across landscapes.

AB  - Land-use change poses a significant threat to biodiversity, particularly in insular ecosystems where species exhibit higher levels of specialisation. Despite the importance of tropical islands for biodiversity conservation, the impacts of land-use change on the diel activity of insular species remain poorly understood. We addressed this gap by investigating the diel activity patterns of insectivorous bats in response to land-use change in S & atilde;o Tom & eacute; Island, Central West Africa. Using passive acoustic detectors, we surveyed insectivorous bats across forests, shaded plantations, oil palm plantations, agricultural and urban areas. We examined (1) how intraspecific diel activity varies between forest and human-altered land-use types, and (2) how interspecific diel activity varies within the same land-use type, by quantifying overlap coefficients in species activity. Based on 19,383 bat passes from four species, we found that the degree of overlap in species-specific activity between forests and human-altered land-use types varied between species, with the least overlap being observed between forests and urban areas for Miniopterus newtoni, and between forests and oil palm plantations for Chaerephon spp. Overlap in the activity of different species was lower within less or not disturbed land-use types (forests and shaded plantations), where more species were present. Overall, diel activity of insectivorous bats altered according to the magnitude of structural land-use change. Such bat responses might be eventually due to the different temporal prey availability and interspecific competition in the altered land-use types. These findings comprise baseline knowledge informing evidence-based management actions across tropical island systems.

AB  - Introduced ecosystem engineers are expected to have extensive ecological impacts on a broad range of resident biota by altering the physical-chemical structure of ecosystems. Livestock that are potentially important introduced ecosystem engineers in grassland systems could create and/or modify habitats for native plant-dwelling insects. Yet, there is little knowledge of how insects respond to engineering effects of introduced livestock. To bridge this gap, we tested how domestic sheep affects the behavior and abundance of a native grasshopper Euchorthippus unicolor at both low (11.8 +/- 0.4 plant species per plot) and high (19.8 +/- 0.5 plant species per plot) diversity sites. Results found grasshoppers shifted their resting and feeding locations from the upper to the intermediate or low layers of vegetation, and fed on more plants species following livestock engineering effects. In the low plant diversity habitats, grazing caused grasshoppers to increase switching frequency, spend more time searching for host plants, and reduce time spent feeding, but had opposite effects on all the three behaviors in the high-diversity habitats. Moreover, grazing engineering effects on behavioral changes of grasshoppers were potentially related to their abundance. Overall, this study highlights native insect species' behavior and abundance in responses to introduced ecological engineers, and suggests that ecosystem engineers of non-native species have strong and important impacts extending beyond their often most obvious and frequently documented direct ecological effects.

AB  - Seabirds are among the most threatened birds globally, with the loss or deterioration of coastal breeding habitats posing a severe threat. Natural and anthropogenic disturbances substantially influence coastal ecosystems through erosion and vegetation loss, altering habitat for the wildlife species that depend on them. In addition to these disturbances, oceanographic processes may play an important role in shaping the vegetation at breeding habitats; however, there is limited information on how vegetative conditions for burrow nesting seabirds have changed over time, and whether these changes are related to specific oceanographic or climatic factors. The Oregon Coast National Wildlife Refuge Complex, USA (NWRC) is home to a diverse suite of 1.3 million nesting seabirds from 14 species, which provide valuable ecological, economic, and cultural services, including nutrient transfer to terrestrial habitats and ecotourism for local communities. Over the last 30 years, populations of several burrow nesting seabird species including tufted puffin (Fratercula cirrhata) and rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata), which breed on offshore islands, have sharply declined along the Oregon Coast. To better understand the potential factors driving these declines, we conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of an aspect of burrow nesting seabird habitat, vegetation cover, within the Oregon Coast NWRC. Specifically, we quantified vegetative cover on 16 islands from 1992 to 2022 using a combination of empirical data, historical aerial photography (1992-2005), and aerial photography from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (2005-2022). Results showed cyclical fluctuations in vegetation cover coast-wide, which were closely related to large scale oceanographic oscillations. Specifically, vegetation cover was negatively correlated with the winter Pacific Decadal Oscillation and positively correlated with the spring El Nino Southern Oscillation. We did not directly compare seabird population trends to vegetation trends; however, quantifying these long-term changes in vegetation at breeding habitats can contribute to our comprehensive understanding of the myriad factors influencing seabird population dynamics and conservation.

AB  - Eradication of herbivores, due to human disturbances, produces a demographic outburst of highly competitive prey species, which in turn reduces plant species diversity. This happens at Los Tuxtlas tropical rainforest, Mexico, where a population outburst of the understory palm Astrocaryum mexicanum is ostensibly excluding tree species, but how this is occurring is still unknown. We used a neighborhood approach to explore the effects of palm shading and palm crowding on the survival and growth (RGR) of saplings of six common tree species. Sixteen to 32 saplings (1.5-2.5 m height) per species were used as focal individuals of circular neighborhoods (4 m radius), which included palms >= 1cm stem length potentially competing for light or soil resources. Shading was estimated using hemispherical photographs. Overall, survivorship was high combining all species (93.8%/yr). In most species, shading produced a displacement of the crown, which increased with specific leaf area of species. In three species, shading had a negative effect on RGR without any effect of crowding, the contrary occurred in two species, and in one species no effects were found. No effects due to trees (DBH >= 1cm) crowding were detected. The shading effect increased with species leaf dry matter content (LDMC), while the effect of crowding declined with LDMC and increased with sapling total leaf area. We argue that the species-dependent palm shading/crowding effects were related to the shade tolerance of sapling species. In the long-term, such species-specific responses could have consequences for forest structure and composition, as saplings develop to mature stages. Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB  - Predator-prey dynamics are a fundamental part of ecology, but directly studying interactions has proven difficult. The proliferation of camera trapping has enabled the collection of large datasets on wildlife, but researchers face hurdles inferring interactions from observational data. Recent advances in hierarchical co-abundance models infer species interactions while accounting for two species' detection probabilities, shared responses to environmental covariates, and propagate uncertainty throughout the entire modeling process. However, current approaches remain unsuitable for interacting species whose natural densities differ by an order of magnitude and have contrasting detection probabilities, such as predator-prey interactions, which introduce zero inflation and overdispersion in count histories. Here, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical N-mixture co-abundance model that is suitable for inferring predator-prey interactions. We accounted for excessive zeros in count histories using an informed zero-inflated Poisson distribution in the abundance formula and accounted for overdispersion in count histories by including a random effect per sampling unit and sampling occasion in the detection probability formula. We demonstrate that models with these modifications outperform alternative approaches, improve model goodness-of-fit, and overcome parameter convergence failures. We highlight its utility using 20 camera trapping datasets from 10 tropical forest landscapes in Southeast Asia and estimate four predator-prey relationships between tigers, clouded leopards, and muntjac and sambar deer. Tigers had a negative effect on muntjac abundance, providing support for top-down regulation, while clouded leopards had a positive effect on muntjac and sambar deer, likely driven by shared responses to unmodelled covariates like hunting. This Bayesian co-abundance modeling approach to quantify predator-prey relationships is widely applicable across species, ecosystems, and sampling approaches and may be useful in forecasting cascading impacts following widespread predator declines. Taken together, this approach facilitates a nuanced and mechanistic understanding of food-web ecology.

AB  - The relative roles of plants competing for resources versus top-down control of vegetation by herbivores, in turn impacted by predators, during early stages of tropical forest succession remain poorly understood. Here we examine the impact of insectivorous birds, bats, and ants exclusion on arthropods communities on replicated 5 x 5 m of pioneering early successional vegetation plots in lowland tropical forest gaps in Papua New Guinea. In plots from which focal taxa of predators were excluded we observed increased biomass of herbivorous and predatory arthropods, and increased density, and decreased diversity of herbivorous insects. However, changes in the biomass of plants, herbivores, and arthropod predators were positively correlated or uncorrelated between these three trophic levels and also between individual arthropod orders. Arthropod abundance and biomass correlated strongly with the plant biomass irrespective of the arthropods' trophic position, a signal of bottom-up control. Patterns in herbivore specialization confirm lack of a strong top-down control and were largely unaffected by the exclusion of insectivorous birds, bats, and ants. No changes of plant-herbivore interaction networks were detected except for decrease in modularity of the exclosure plots. Our results suggest weak top-down control of herbivores, limited compensation between arthropod and vertebrate predators, and limited intra-guild predation by birds, bats, and ants. Possible explanations are strong bottom-up control, a low activity of the higher order predators, especially birds, possibly also bats, in gaps, and continuous influx of herbivores from surrounding mature forest matrix.

AB  - Mediterranean environments are characterized by strong intra- and inter-annual fluctuations in plant primary production, which are likely to regulate the carrying capacity and density-dependent responses of ungulate populations. These effects may, however, vary across spatial and temporal scales. Habitat heterogeneity, particularly when associated to differentiated phenological responses, may allow wild ungulates to mitigate temporal fluctuations in plant production by using different resources along the year. In this work, we use a 15-years dataset (including remote-sensing data on vegetation distribution, phenology and production, as well as ungulate population counts) to assess how temporal variability in plant primary production and livestock abundance influence the population dynamics of two wild ungulates: native red deer, Cervus elaphus, and introduced fallow deer, Dama dama. Results show that temporal alternation in the phenological cycles of the four different vegetation types increased plant production, thus food availability for ungulates, within each year. Furthermore, complementarity in the responses of different vegetation types to variations in the amount and timing of rainfall increased the predictability of food availability across different years. This complementarity effect was further increased by the contrasting responses of ungulate populations to variation in the production of different vegetation types. Furthermore, domestic ungulates had positive effects on wild ungulate density at low to intermediate abundances, but high livestock densities decreased ungulate density and constrained the stability of the plant-ungulate system in response to the impact of climatic variation, particularly under climate change. Our findings deepen the knowledge on vegetation-ungulate interactions in Mediterranean areas, potentially contributing to develop better management strategies of ungulate populations and adapt them to ongoing climate change.

AB  - Tree regeneration (TR) in canopy gaps is a key process to understand how forest ecosystems might adapt to future environmental changes. Since successful TR is the result of a complex interplay of several stochastic events such as gap formation, seed production, ungulate pressure and diseases, some of the processes have been neglected or strongly reduced for model applications. Most empirical data on TR originate from (national) forest inventories based on statistically optimized designs for timber resource estimations and use geographically fixed permanent plots. Consequently, these representative samples record TR both in gaps as well as under closed canopy conditions. In this study, we compared TR in 63 representative plots of the Swiss National Forest Inventory (?NFI sampling?), located in beech and silver fir-beech forests along an elevation gradient in the Jura Mts., with an opportunistic ?gap sampling? strategy targeting TR-clusters. We analyzed quantitative (e.g., number of individuals) and qualitative (e.g., species diversity, similarity to surrounding canopy) differences between the ?NFI sampling? and ?gap sampling,? as well as the environmental factors (e.g., gap size, cluster age, elevation) influencing the composition of TR in small canopy gaps. The ?gap sampling? recorded higher median TR densities (+62%, stems ha- 1) and species richness (4.0 ? 2.1, mean ? sd) than the ?NFI sampling?. More importantly, the ?gap sampling? provided much more consistent results among sites (i.e., 4x lower variance). Consequently, the ?gap sampling? revealed not only general but also species-specific patterns across TR size classes and along elevational gradients in contrast to the lack of patterns in the ?NFI sampling?. Species richness decreased as TR grew taller, and the tallest TR size class (>130 cm) was almost solely comprised of the dominant species in the surrounding canopy (direct ingrowth). The high amount of direct ingrowth in TR indicates that small canopy gaps might offer only limited management potential to alter forests and that extensive disturbances or management at early TR stages (sapling) would be necessary to promote species better suited to the expected future site conditions. We raise the question of whether a forest monitoring that is statistically optimized for timber resource estimation is best suited to detect adaptation effects to quickly changing environments best visible at the regeneration stage, or whether forest inventory tools should be extended by methods that focus on disturbed parts of forests where changes and adaptations take place. We propose the implementation of an opportunistic gap-based monitoring of TR that essentially serves to identify the best forest management strategies (e.g. gap size, intervention intervals) in forests adapting to environmental change.

AB  - ContextWild ungulates and livestock modify a large range of vegetation patterns and processes at the landscape scale. However, we still lack studies that address how changes in herbivores' type and management can determine small-scale ecosystem functioning.ObjectivesWe compared landscape vegetation processes within a traditional livestock grazing (transhumant) and a system consisting exclusively of wild ungulates. We also investigated methodological approaches to map very fine spatial-scale changes in vegetation structure and functioning over time in a mountainous Mediterranean system (Iberian Peninsula).MethodsWe performed different UAV flights per season over exclusion fences, within these two long-term grazing contexts. Later, we processed images to obtain spatially explicit data on vegetation structure (vegetation cover and mean vegetation patch area) and vegetation greenness (NDVI).ResultsVery high spatial-resolution images provided key information on the spatial distribution and seasonal oscillation of small vegetation patches. Mean annual NDVI showed similar values in both grazing contexts albeit seasonal and annual differences in NDVI between grazed and ungrazed areas. Vegetation cover remained rather constant across seasons but differed between grazing contexts and fencing. The mean vegetation patch area changed seasonally according to the grazing context, without significant differences in mean annual values in fenced and non-fenced areas.ConclusionsAccurate image classification helped to uncover differences in vegetation functioning in presence of wild ungulates and livestock. Multi-temporal studies at this fine-scale level improve the detection of ephemeral vegetation patches and increase the comprehension of cascade processes mediated by both ungulate groups, such as vegetation response to climate. The temporal and spatial vegetation patterns should be considered before the implementation of management measures, especially in landscapes within potential rewilding processes.

AB  - Northwest North America has unique high elevation Picea-Abies forests and parkland classified in British Columbia as the Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine-fir (ESSF) Biogeoclimatic zone. These ecosystems occur on a topographically and climatically complex landscape, juxtaposed with diverse vegetation types including alpine tundra, inland rain forest, dry conifer forest, and grasslands. Spatio-temporal ecosystem disturbance is varied, driven by factors such as climate variation, wildfire, volcanic eruptions, and insect herbivory. A pollen and charcoal record derived from a lake sediment core from the ESSF reveals a unique late-glacial to modern vegetation history progressing from alpine steppe through dry open conifer forest to moist spruce-fir ecosystems, the latter arising only 4600 years ago, late by comparison to other ESSF sites in the region. Repeated disturbance in the mid Holocene by wildfire coupled with volcanic ash deposition and increased climatic variation resulted in recurring Pinus contorta-dominated seral forest stands before cooling and moistening in the late Holocene led to stable Picea-Abies forest. With rapid climate change, changing disturbance regimes, and timber harvest, the management of dry ESSF forests needs to consider that this forest-type could transform into parkland or open seral pine stands, with a high frequency disturbance regime.

AB  - The Asian water buffalo was introduced in Brazil in in the late nineteenth century. Today the country harbours one of the largest populations in the world, most of it in the Amazon basin. The majority of populations are domesticated, but feral populations have established in several protected areas. One of the largest, comprising both feral and free-living domestic individuals, is in Lago Piratuba Biological Reserve (LPBR) and Maraca-Jipioca Ecological Station (MJES) in Amapa state. Water buffalo cause serious damage to floodplains in both areas and their population control has been recommended. In 2017, we conducted aerial surveys using the double-count technique to estimate the size and distribution of the water buffalo population at LPBR and MJES. To assess population trends, we compared our results with two previous population estimates (2007 and 2013) for the same areas as well as with data from the Brazilian agricultural census (2007 to 2017) for the region. We estimated a population of 17,782 and 686 buffalo at LPBR and MJES, respectively. Compared to previous surveys, the population at MJES has remained stable, but the LPBR population declined by more than 40% compared to the last survey. The decline was virtually limited to one survey sector at LPBR. The decline is mirrored by the agricultural census data, but its reasons are unclear. We recommend continued monitoring, as the population can quickly rebound to previous numbers if left unchecked.

AB  - Rabbits have travelled with humans to the most remote archipelagos, having been introduced on at least 800 islands worldwide. This herbivore has caused a devastating effect on endemic insular plants, causing changes in species composition, cascading extinctions and disruption of native seed dispersal systems worldwide. However, its ecological impacts as disrupting native seed dispersal systems have not been studied from a holistic perspective in any of the archipelagos where rabbits were introduced. Here, we assess the role of rabbits as frugivores and seed-dispersers on the most extensive and diverse island of the Canary Archipelago, Tenerife, across its five main vegetation zones represented in an altitudinal gradient 0-3715 m a.s.l. To this end, 120 transects per vegetation zone were conducted (August 2020-November 2021) to collect fresh faecal samples from a total of 244 latrines. They consisted of 29,538 droppings in which we found seeds from 73 plant species, 29 of which were identified to species level (13 endemic, eight natives and eight introduced by humans). About 70% of the seeds were identified as fleshy-fruited plant species while the remaining nine were dry fruits. Of the former, only nine showed a percentage of intact seeds greater than 75%, another nine species between 50 and 75%, and three lower than 50%. The digestive effect of rabbits on seedling emergence was generally low, compared to that produced by native seed dispersers. Since fleshy-fruited plants and rabbits have not been linked in their evolutionary history in the Canaries, the former seems to have their own legitimate seed dispersers.

AB  - The current study assessed the negative influence of grazing on the diversity and community structure of the local flora along environmental gradients in the Prince Saud Al-Faisal Center for Wildlife Research (PSCWR), Taif, Saudi Arabia. Seventy-five stands (20 x 20 m) were used to examine these vegetative characteristics and palatability for excluded and grazed sites. The study identified 80 species of local flora belonging to 27 families with an increased prevalence of Poaceae, Monoregionals, and therophytes. The un-grazing sites included the highest number of species (60 species), while the grazing enclosures had the lowest (15 species). About 75% of the total species were grazing, and 55% were medicinal. Eight vegetation groups (VGs) were produced through two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), with Argemone ochroleuca -Vachellia flava community dominating the un-grazing area was the most diverse. The PCA diagram showed that soil NO3-, SO42-, Na+, Mg2+, and Cl- significantly affected the dominant plant communities. The findings imply that implementing livestock exclusion could be a helpful, long-term management strategy for the degraded rangelands of the study area. According to the hypothesis of the study, grazing activity and environmental factors are the most effective for differentiating plant communities and the variability in plant diversity.

AB  - Previous research conducted in central-east region of Argentina recorded potential orthohantavirus host rodents in diverse environments, but no research has focused particularly on islands, the environments that present the greatest risk to humans. For this reason, the aims of this research were to determine the orthohantavirus host in the rodent community focused on islands of Parana River Delta, central-east region of Argentina, to identify temporal and spatial factors associated with orthohantavirus prevalence variations, to compare the functional traits of seropositive and seronegative rodents, and to explore the association between orthohantavirus prevalence and rodent community characteristics between August 2014 and May 2018. With a trapping effort of 14,600 trap-nights, a total of 348 sigmodontine rodent specimens belonging to seven species were captured 361 times. The overall antibody prevalence was 4.9%. Particularly, 14.9% of Oligoryzomys flavescens and 1.5% of Oxymycterus rufus, mainly reproductively active adult males, had antibodies against orthohantavirus. Even though O. flavescens inhabit all islands, our results suggest spatial heterogeneity in the viral distribution, with two months after periods of low temperature presenting increases in seroprevalence. This could be a response to the increased proportion of adults present in the rodent population. In addition, an association was found between the high seroprevalence and the diversity of the rodent assemblage. We also found 1.5% of O. rufus exposed to orthohantavirus, which shows us that further investigation of the ecology of the virus is needed to answer whether this species act as a spillover or a new competent host.

AB  - Fences have recently been recognized as one of the most prominent linear infrastructures on earth. As animals traverse fenced landscapes, they adjust movement behaviours to optimize resource access while minimizing energetic costs of coping with fences. Examining individual responses is key for connecting localized fence effects with population dynamics.We investigated the multi-scale effects of fencing on animal movements, space use and survival of 61 pronghorn and 96 mule deer on a gradient of fence density in Wyoming, USA.Taking advantage of the recently developed Barrier Behaviour Analysis, we classified individual movement responses upon encountering fences (i.e. barrier behaviours). We adopted the reaction norm framework to jointly quantify individual plasticity and behavioural types of barrier behaviours, as well as behaviour syndromes between barrier behaviours and animal space use. We also assessed whether barrier behaviours affect individual survival.Our results highlighted a high-level individual plasticity encompassing differences in the degree and direction of barrier behaviours for both pronghorn and mule deer. Additionally, these individual differences were greater at higher fence densities. For mule deer, fence density determined the correlation between barrier behaviours and space use and was negatively associated with individual survival. However, these relationships were not statistically significant for pronghorn.By integrating approaches from movement ecology and behavioural ecology with the emerging field of fence ecology, this study provides new evidence that an extraordinarily widespread linear infrastructure uniquely impacts animals at the individual level. Managing landscape for lower fence densities may help prevent irreversible behavioural shifts for wide-ranging animals in fenced landscapes.

AB  - Accelerated warming of the Arctic has reduced sea ice and has increased the occurrence of winter extreme events like rain-on-snow and storms that impact sonal movements and grazing conditions. We used caribou movements between Banks, Melville and Victoria islands and mainland Canada, documented from Indigenous Knowledge, to assess whether spatiotemporal trends in sea-ice anomalies (1983-2019) can be used as an indicator of caribou movement. We used the SNOWPACK model to evaluate how foraging conditions (as indexed by simulated snow properties) contribute to the prediction of caribou presence. Our results suggest that changes in sea-ice anomalies over time have impacted caribou crossings between islands: caribou no longer use areas with less sea ice whilst they continue to use areas with more sea ice. Our model evaluation shows that, when the simulated snow conditions are paired with other environmental variables, the ability of models to predict Peary caribou occurrence on land was enhanced across Banks and Melville islands. Overall, the land models suggest that caribou are more likely to occupy areas with lower density of snow accumulation and a majority of forb tundra with dwarf shrubs for Banks Island and cryptogam tundra, rush and grass for the Melville Island Complex. Our results suggest that future work monitoring changes in sea-ice and snow conditions will be important for understanding the impact of climate change on the distribution of Peary caribou in the western Arctic.

AB  - I report the first documented observation of chafing behavior by a silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis) on an oceanic manta ray (Mobula birostris) in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. The interaction occurred at Malpelo Island, Colombia, a remote marine protected area and biodiversity hotspot. An adult silky shark was observed rubbing its flanks against the ventral surface of a large manta ray on four separate occasions within a 15-s interval. While the manta ray displayed avoidance behaviors, the shark persistently engaged in the interaction. Chafing in sharks has been previously interpreted as a potential mechanism for ectoparasite removal, representing a rarely observed but ecologically relevant interspecific interaction among pelagic megafauna. This observation contributes to our understanding of behavioral ecology in open-ocean ecosystems.

AB  - Australia has lost a substantial proportion of its small to medium-sized mammals since European colonisation. Given the passage of time since local extinctions - decades to more than a century for much of the continent - the consequences of these changes for vegetation are poorly known. In this study, we take advantage of two well-established mammal reintroduction projects in southern inland Australia to examine the ecological consequences for vegetation of re-established mammal populations. The study is based on replicated surveys inside and outside fenced reintroduction sites, with treatments characterised by varying presence, absence and composition of reintroduced mammals, feral predators and feral herbivores. We found a suite of differences in vegetation between reintroduction sites and matched controls, with generally lower richness inside reintroduction sites (with one exception). Other compositional differences varied by location, with some functional groups - herbaceous chenopods, shrubby chenopods, introduced geophytes and low shrubs - and a few individual chenopod species - being less frequent inside the reintroduction site at one location. At the same site, mistletoes and orchids were less abundant inside than outside the reintroduction site. Structural differences included a higher percentage of bare ground inside, and a higher ground layer for one inside treatment versus outside. Although the absence of baseline data and replicated temporal data limits inference as to causal factors, many of the results are consistent with data from other reintroduction sites. Some results, especially those for geophytes, mistletoes and some chenopods, may indicate long-term consequences for those taxa. Whilst predator-fencing substantially contributes to prevention of extinction of highly threatened mammals, some environmental trade-offs are inevitable. Nonetheless, given the aims of reintroductions include re-constructing natural ecosystem processes, the resulting changes to vegetation require ongoing investigation and further monitoring.

AB  - Land managers spend substantial resources managing invasive species to mitigate their negative ecological and economic impacts. However, invasive species management is seldom coupled with empirical assessments of management outcomes or the ecological impacts of the target species. Additionally, the study of invasive species has, until recently, neglected to acknowledge co-stressors on native communities, which often are the drivers of ecological degradation. We assessed the effects of the invasive plant Vincetoxicum rossicum and its removal on understory plant communities, as well as whether these effects were mediated by deer and invasive earthworms. We used paired fenced and open plots with V. rossicum and an open plot without V. rossicum at each of the three forested sites in New York State Parks from 2017 to 2020. Following a nested design, we located paired sets of open and fenced plots in areas where V. rossicum was experimentally removed and in areas where it was unmanaged. After three years of V. rossicum removal, V. rossicum significantly declined. However, the ultimate goal of management was native plant recovery. Contrary to this aim, native plant diversity and cover increased if V. rossicum was left unmanaged but did not change with V. rossicum removal. Thus, we provide strong evidence that reducing target species abundance does not always translate into native plant recovery. This disparity may be because deer and invasive earthworms are stronger drivers of understory plant communities than V. rossicum, as native plant cover and diversity were lower the more earthworms were in a plot and invasive plant species declined after fencing to exclude deer. Management that prioritizes reducing deer and earthworm impacts over invasive plant removal is therefore worth exploring, especially when coupled with continued monitoring to assess if these actions result in the desired management outcomes. Overall, our findings underscore the need to collect data to test management assumptions: reducing the abundance of an invader may not always result in native plant recovery, especially if other stressors are the ultimate drivers of change in invaded communities.

AB  - Interactions between species within an ecosystem (e.g. predation and herbivory) play a vital role in sustaining the ecosystem functionality, which includes aspects like pest control and nutrient cycling. Unfortunately, human activities are progressively disrupting these trophic relationships, thereby contributing to the ongoing biodiversity decline. Additionally, certain human activities like urbanization may further impact the intensity of these trophic interactions, which are already known to be influenced by latitudinal gradients. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis of whether the impact of human population, used as a proxy for human pressure, differs between latitudes. To test it, we selected 18 study sites at two latitudes (i.e. similar to 53 degrees N and similar to 50 degrees N) with varying human population density (HPD). We used artificial caterpillars placed on European beech branches to assess bird predation and took standardized pictures of the leaves to estimate insect herbivory. Remote sensing techniques were used to estimate human pressure. We found that the intensity of bird predation varied in response to HPD, with opposite trends observed depending on the latitude. At our upper latitude, bird predation increased with HPD, while the opposite was observed at the lower latitude. Herbivory was not affected by urbanization and we found higher levels of herbivory in the lower compared to the higher latitude. At the lower latitude, certain species may experience a disadvantage attributed to the urban heat island effect due to their sensitivity to temperature fluctuations. Conversely, at the higher latitude, where minimum temperatures can be a limitation, certain species may benefit from milder winters. Overall, this study highlights the complex and dynamic nature of trophic relationships in the face of human-driven changes to ecosystems. It also emphasizes the importance of considering both human pressure and latitudinal gradients when assessing the ecological consequences of future climate change scenarios, especially in urban environments.

AB  - Interspecific interactions play a central role in structuring animal communities and food webs. In particular, carnivores are important topdown regulators in ecological communities and the loss of carnivore species can have devastating ecosystem effects. Similarly, carnivore reintroductions are successful if the prey base is sufficient to support population growth, making the case for the importance of bottom-up regulation processes. As such, rewilding efforts targeted at restoring food webs and natural community regulation processes (trophic rewilding) have become increasingly popular. However, investigations of regulation processes in terrestrial vertebrate communities often take place in heavily altered systems, potentially biasing inference on the presence or importance of top-down versus bottom-up regulation processes. Here, we use a stable mammalian assemblage in the Romanian Carpathians to evaluate the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up processes and provide a benchmark for understanding the effects and the success of rewilding initiatives. To do so, we used camera trap data from two consecutive years in the Southern Romanian Carpathians and developed hypothesisbased interaction pathways for top-down and bottom-up regulation in a piecewise structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. Results from SEMs indicate that while both top-down (wolf and Eurasian lynx-driven) and bottom-up processes (driven by roe deer, red deer, wild boar and hare abundance) play important roles in shaping community structure, landscape characteristics (i.e., terrain ruggedness, road density, elevation, and forest cover) have a greater effect on both predators and prey. The results of this research have implications for rewilding efforts in Europe and globally. This study highlights the importance of preserving natural habitats, underscoring that effective species conservation and coexistence must go hand in hand with conserving natural spaces.

AB  - Conflicts derived from the proactive management of ecosystems and wildlife populations abound in national parks, which can prevent the control of some animal populations, consequently causing negative effects to the ecological values and creating health risks for the ecosystems. This work quantifies a conflict related to population control of the Iberian ibex in the Sierra de Guadarrama National Park in Spain where ecological values and health risks are at stake. A discrete choice experiment was conducted of three population samples: 430 on-site visitors, 210 off-site visitors and 210 non-visitors, and two levels of status quo information were considered. The results show that not conducting any ibex management program in the park causes a loss of social wellbeing and that the design of the management program is shown to be relevant for obtaining greater or lesser acceptance by the surveyed population. In general, better ecological and health levels, as well as avoiding having to kill animals in the park, increase a program's acceptance. Management measures are also shown to take on greater importance to the extent that the results in the health and ecological indicators are worse. Finally, in aggregate terms, additional information about the status quo did not generate major differences in the estimates of a change of well-being.

AB  - In the lower Florida Keys, the endangered Florida Key deer and numerous other wildlife species inhabit a vulnerable island environment susceptible to storm surges and rising seawater due to low elevation and flat terrain. Timely and reliable assessment of vegetation damage from natural disasters, such as Hurricane Irma, is crucial for effective habitat management. The study ' s overall objective is to examine Hurricane Irma ' s impact on vegetation on No Name Key, Florida, using remote sensing. The study relates the area change in vegetation obtained from remote sensing analysis to Florida Key deer population changes following the storm. The methodology involved performing a thematic change detection analysis using the following data sources: (1) aerial multispectral images (for pre- and post -Hurricane), (2) airborne lidar data (for pre- and postHurricane), (3) an existing vegetation map, and (4) soil data. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) image classification algorithm was applied to pre- and post -storm input image stacks to create pre- and post -Hurricane Irma vegetation maps. We were then able to obtain the area change information (for various vegetation categories) by performing the change detection analysis of the 2 SVM-classified images. The differences in areas following the storm were calculated for 7 affected vegetation types. Using the area change information following Hurricane Irma, we estimated the number of deer supported by the storm -affected vegetation. These estimated deer numbers, based on the area differences in post -Hurricane Irma vegetation types, were compared to observed deer numbers collected during the post -Hurricane Irma Texas A &M Natural Resources Institute (NRI) deer field survey. The results showed the following: mangroves had the largest negative area changes (area loss), followed by pinelands, hardwoods/hammocks, developed areas, and buttonwoods. Freshwater marshes had the largest positive area changes (area gain). The deer ' s preferred vegetation areas had decreased post -Hurricane Irma, resulting in a reduced deer population compared to pre -storm numbers. The predicted number of the Key deer post -Hurricane Irma fell within a 95% confidence interval of the observed deer population from the post -storm field survey. The study findings and techniques could be applied to study climate change impact, especially sea level rise. This methodology can be valuable in assessing the impact of storms on other wildlife species in similar environments. The applications and methodology are especially relevant considering the increasing frequency and intensity of storm surges and the accelerating rate of sea level rise.

AB  - In dryland ecosystems, grazing and increasing aridity (aridification) are major drivers of biotic community modification. Although some studies have indicated that the effects of grazing on plant communities change with aridity, the effects on ground-dwelling arthropod communities remain unclear. This study examined (1) ariditydependent grazing effects on plant communities (plant species richness and community-weighted mean [CWM] of plant height) and ground-dwelling arthropod communities (abundances of herbivores, detritivores, and omnivores) and (2) the variation in interlinkages among grazing, plant communities, and ground-dwelling arthropod communities for steppe and desert steppe in a wide aridity range of Mongolian grasslands. The abundance of herbivores was enhanced by grazing, regardless of aridity. In contrast, with increasing aridity, the negative effects of grazing on the abundance of detritivores weakened, and the abundance of omnivores, mostly that of ants, shifted from positive to negative. A grazing-induced decrease in the CWM of plant height exhibited positive effects on the abundance of omnivores and negative effects on that of detritivores in the steppe; however, these effects were not observed in the desert steppe. Conclusively, this study highlights how aridity mediates the effects of grazing on plant and arthropod communities, providing insights into the changing dynamics of dryland ecosystems.

AB  - 1. Fire-herbivory feedbacks strongly influence the formation of grazing lawns in savanna ecosystems. Preliminary findings suggest that small-scale (<25 ha) fires can engineer grazing lawns by concentrating herbivores on the post-burn green flush; however, the persistence of such grazing lawns over the longer term and without repeated fire is unknown. 2. We used high-resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to investigate the long-term effects of fire manipulation on short grass structure (height, cover, volume and spatial continuity) and grazing lawn establishment in Kruger National Park, South Africa. We analysed the effects of fire exclusion and experimental burns applied over a 7-year period (2013-2019) followed by a 1-year cessation of burning at varying spatial scales during the early and late dry seasons. 3. Fires contributed a fourfold increase in short grass cover, regardless of fire season or size. The distribution of grass height differed significantly between fire-induced grazing lawns and recently unburnt parts of the landscape where controlled fires were excluded over the experimental period. The volume (corresponding to bulk density) of short grass on the landscape responded strongly to fires, with grass volume <20 cm in height increasing with both early and late dry season fires. 4. Early dry season fires caused larger and more homogeneous short grass patches. Furthermore, early dry season fires were more influential in increasing the cover of the shortest grass height class (1-5 cm). 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that fire-induced grazing lawns can persist over the longer term, even when fires are no longer applied, leading to the creation of vertical and horizontal heterogeneity in the grass layer. Small-scale fires, therefore, represent a feasible management approach to expanding grazing lawn extent, potentially benefiting grazer coexistence and diversity.

AB  - Macropods exhibit selective herbivory on plant traits within and between species and hence can alter plant trait variation. In this study, we asked what are the effects of macropod herbivory on intraspecific variation in plant traits of forest understory species? We tested the effects of herbivory by macropods on eight plant traits, in nine understory species using a herbivore exclusion experiment. Generalized linear mixed models were used to test for differences between herbivory treatments in trait means as well as variation within species and at the community level. Macropod herbivory resulted in differences in either the mean trait value or trait variance within a species for seven of the eight tested plant traits. Macropod exclusion resulted in larger dimensions of size for most species, as well as changes in specific leaf area, moisture content, and carbon content of leaves. Further, community-weighted means of specific leaf area, moisture content, and leaf nitrogen were lower in the presence of macropods. Plant trait variance was altered for three of the seven community-weighted traits. This study demonstrates a mechanism through which macropods can drive changes in the traits of understory plant species. Plant traits have been linked to various larger scale ecological processes including ecosystem flammability, nutrient cycling, response to global change, and habitat suitability for other organisms. Therefore, herbivore-induced changes in plant trait variation and community composition could have important flow-on effects for other environmental processes and hence should be considered in management decisions regarding fire-prone ecosystems.

AB  - Managing feral water buffalo in the Northern Territory is a formidable challenge. As an introduced species, buffalo are associated with a myriad of biosecurity, economic, cultural and environmental issues ranging from overgrazing, decreased water quality, disease vectors to the destruction of cultural assets. Nevertheless, the buffalo are also a harvestable resource that can support economic development of the region. To mitigate some of the biosecurity, economic, cultural and environmental risks they pose and manage buffalo effectively, we need a detailed understanding of their spatial and behavioural ecology. However, several factors make understanding how best to manage the dense populations of wild individuals challenging as buffalo inhabit remote areas with limited infrastructure and accessibility and their large size and often aggressive nature can make them difficult to observe in otherwise inaccessible areas. GPS tracking allows for high-frequency data collection and surveillance of individual buffalo. Here, we investigated how the different seasonal periods of a Northern Territory floodplain area shaped patterns of habitat use for 17 buffalo tracked over 16 months. We found in the dry season, buffalo space use is restricted, and the size of home ranges are significantly smaller than in the wet season. During the wet season, buffalo expand their home range area as well as their social encounter area with other buffalo. These differences in their space use and social patterns suggest that increased disease surveillance may be needed for the wet season when buffalo are more likely to share space and interact. During the dry season, however, buffalo movement is more predictable and restricted, suggesting greater optimisation opportunities for buffalo management. Results from these models can be used by land holders, Traditional Owners and wildlife managers to make evidence-based decisions to improve buffalo management with respect to disease risk, sustainable harvest and damage to environmental and cultural assets.

AB  - Unprecedented anthropogenic changes to biodiversity and biogeography demand a greater understanding of the consequences of altered faunal composition for ecosystem functioning. Selective predation has important, yet poorly understood effects on ecosystem stability, and can be strongly influenced by the relative frequencies of different prey types in the environment. Yet, how predators adjust their selection for prey according to their environmental frequency is often overlooked. Here, we assessed frequency dependent selection of prey by dingoes and foxes in the Australian desert, biannually, across a nine-year period (2007-2016). Both predators exhibited potentially destabilizing, negative frequency dependent selection for prey. Foxes persisted to preferentially consume a threatened, native rodent (Notomys fuscus) when it was environmentally scarce. Bolstered by the observation that N.fuscus occurs at low densities in areas where foxes are common, our results suggest that N.fuscus is particularly vulnerable to predation by this predator; possibly because it is naive and/or lacks adaptations to avoid or escape predation by the relatively recently introduced fox. Dingoes tended to consume reptiles when they were scarce; potentially constituting a conservation concern if selected reptilian taxa are threatened. Foxes avoided, thus were unlikely to control populations of overabundant kangaroos, while both foxes and dingoes showed a preference for, and may therefore control populations of invasive rabbits. The integration of our results into the relative suites of (de)stabilizing influences exerted by dingoes and foxes is important to provide a more dynamic insight into how each predator impacts their naturally fluctuating ecosystems.

AB  - The factors that drive fish communities on coral reefs are varied, complex, and often location specific. In the northern United States Virgin Islands, the large areas of mesophotic coral ecosystems across an insular shelf provide a multitude of gradients along which fish communities form. Using a stratified -random visual fish census, we collected comprehensive data on fish communities across a seascape scale. Fish density and diversity showed responses to depth and hard relief, with these factors occasionally interacting in ways that are species specific. Analysis of trophic groups showed that densities of all groups were positively associated with relief, but while herbivores and invertivores decreased with depth, planktivores and piscivores increased, and piscivores additionally showed an interaction. Some commercially important species occurred more frequently and in larger sizes on deeper reefs, suggesting that mesophotic reefs shelter more fisheries resources, although they are less commonly sampled in visual census programs. Understanding how fish communities change across the seascape informs patterns of ecosystem function, such as identifying areas of resilience and vulnerability. This dataset is a valuable contribution to more completely understanding the ecology and conservation of fishes in the western Atlantic.

AB  - Threatened species are frequently patchily distributed across small wild populations, ex situ populations managed with varying levels of intensity and reintroduced populations. Best practice advocates for integrated management across in situ and ex situ populations. Wild addax (Addax nasomaculatus) now number fewer than 100 individuals, yet 1000 of addax remain in ex situ populations, which can provide addax for reintroductions, as has been the case in Tunisia since the mid-1980s. However, integrated management requires genetic data to ascertain the relationships between wild and ex situ populations that have incomplete knowledge of founder origins, management histories, and pedigrees. We undertook a global assessment of genetic diversity across wild, ex situ and reintroduced populations in Tunisia to assist conservation planning for this Critically Endangered species. We show that the remnant wild populations retain more mitochondrial haplotypes that are more diverse than the entirety of the ex situ populations across Europe, North America and the United Arab Emirates, and the reintroduced Tunisian population. Additionally, 1704 SNPs revealed that whilst population structure within the ex situ population is minimal, each population carries unique diversity. Finally, we show that careful selection of founders and subsequent genetic management is vital to ensure genetic diversity is provided to, and minimize drift and inbreeding within reintroductions. Our results highlight a vital need to conserve the last remaining wild addax population, and we provide a genetic foundation for determining integrated conservation strategies to prevent extinction and optimize future reintroductions.

AB  - Protected areas form the backbone of global conservation efforts. Vegetation is the primary foundation for achieving conservation goals, and soil seed banks is a cryptic biodiversity reservoir for recruiting species that may not be represented in above-ground vegetation. Unfortunately, unmanaged grazing by wild herbivores has led to vegetation degradation in semi-arid to arid regions. However, experimental evidence on the long-term impacts of wild herbivores on soil seed banks is largely lacking. Here, with the aim of examining how wild herbivores impact soil seed banks, we investigated the composition of the germinable seed banks in three protected areas (Yathong, Mungo and Boolcoomatta) along a semi-arid to arid precipitation gradient in south-eastern Australia. The density and species richness of the soil seed banks increased with increasing aridity, which indicated that the soil seed banks in arid regions is an important biodiversity reservoir. The effects of wild herbivores on soil seed density were strongly dependent on precipitation. Wild herbivores disrupted the soil seed banks at the most arid site but promoted the accumulation of seeds in the soil at the least arid site. Grazing was linked to an increase in the frequency of the seeds of introduced species and decrease in the frequency of the seeds of perennials. Synthesis and applications: Disruption of the soil seed banks by the grazing of wild herbivores could lead to the failure of post-rain pulses of vegetation growth and hamper efforts to restore vegetation in protected areas. Therefore, suppressing wild herbivore numbers is a strategy that could enhance soil seed bank reserves and revegetation efforts in arid protected areas.

AB  - The seedling stage is a critical point in the life history of plants. The survival and growth of tree seedlings can be affected by both the abiotic and biotic environment. Seedlings of both tropical and temperate forests have been shown to experience conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and positive density dependence (facilitation). American chestnut was once a common species throughout eastern North America that was decimated by an introduced pathogen in the early 1900 s. Here we present an analysis of chestnut seedling ecology in a unique, sexually reproducing population of American chestnut in central Maine, USA, to understand how both conspecific and heterospecific canopy trees along with size and age influence the survival and growth of understory chestnut trees. Using both a cohort analysis and a static life table approach, we found that seedling survival was lower in the first year of life, and those trees that survive their first and second years had consistently high survival. Our data did not support facilitation as none of the neighborhood indices were positive. We found evidence for CNDD for American chestnuts in the first year of life, but we found no evidence for continued effects beyond the first year. Heterospecifics decreased growth and survival of understory chestnuts beyond the first year of life. Enhanced understanding of American chestnut ecology, particularly at the critical seedling stage, can guide management strategies that support reintroduction efforts.

AB  - Predators can generate physiological and behavioural responses in prey individuals. Thus, carnivore reintroductions might cause profound changes in communities and ecosystems by modifying anti-predator responses. Combining observational and experimental approaches, we compared the short-and long-term antipredator responses of capybaras, Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, between a landscape with a high density of predators (Pantanal, Brazil) and a landscape where predators became extinct in the mid-20th century but where a jaguar reintroduction project was in progress (Ibera & DBLBOND;, Argentina). Generalized linear models were used to test whether the presence of natural predators affects capybara behavioural budgets, gregarious behaviour and the associated physiological stress responses and to test whether, in the short term, capybaras increase their vigilance levels after detecting the proximity of a simulated predator (a playback of jaguar, Panthera onca, calls). Capybaras in the Pantanal did not show higher levels of vigilance but they spent a greater proportion of time foraging than did capybaras in Ibera & DBLBOND;. Pantanal groups were smaller and foraged closer to water. The baseline levels of stress hormones tended to be higher in Ibera & DBLBOND;. In response to simulated stimuli, both populations responded to predator sound cues by increasing vigilance, but Ibera & DBLBOND; groups also increased vigilance in response to a control sound, suggesting that they did not recognize the predator stimulus as a greater risk than another stimulus. In areas with predators, capybaras may reduce predation risk by choosing safer areas, where they can spend more time foraging when predators are not nearby. Vigilance may be only a reactive response to cues of the predator's proximity. Understanding the capybara's antipredator responses may help predict the po-tential effects and the success of jaguar reintroduction in a region where the jaguar has been absent for over 80 years.

AB  - The Asian tapir Tapirus indicus is the only tapir species in Southeast Asia. It is declining across its range and is categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The forests of Sumatra are critical to Asian tapir conservation as they contain some of the last remaining populations of the species, yet conservation efforts are hindered by a lack of information on habitat suitability. We collated camera-trap data from nine landscapes across 69,500 km(2) of Sumatran rainforest to help predict suitable habitat for Asian tapirs on the island. Predictions from Bayesian occupancy models demonstrated that tapir occupancy was greatest in forests below 600 m elevation and exclusively in forests with high aboveground biomass. Forests around the Barisan Mountains on the west of Sumatra provide the most suitable habitat for the species. Only 36% of the most critical habitat (i.e. 80th percentile of predicted occupancy values, or above) for tapirs is formally protected for conservation, with much of the remainder found in forests allocated to watershed protection (35%) or logging (23%). We highlight several key areas in Sumatra where tapir conservation could be bolstered, such as by leveraging existing conservation efforts for other charismatic flagships species on the island.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) are one of the most serious threats to global biodiversity and one of the leading causes of federal protection required for native species under the United States Endangered Species Act (ESA). Our goal was to document how IAS impact threatened and endangered species (T&ES) under the ESA to improve recovery efforts. We reviewed Federal Register listing decisions for 1,545 T&ES listed under the ESA and found that 58% were impacted by IAS. Pacific Island T&ES (97%) face greater threats from IAS compared to Mainland (38%) and Atlantic Island T&ES (22%), but the number of IAS impacting T&ES has increased over time in all 3 geographic areas, except for animals on Atlantic Islands. On Pacific Islands, we found that IAS impacted T&ES most through adverse habitat modification and competition, mainly through invasive plants. Negative interactions caused by IAS on the Mainland were mainly from invasive fish and plants, while on the Atlantic Islands they were caused by invasive mammals and plants. The IAS causing the greatest number of negative interactions included rats (Rattus), wild pigs (Sus), goats (Capra), fish (e.g., Lepomis and Micropterus), and various genera of plants (e.g., Schinus, Rubus, and Psidium). Based on our findings, immediate actions are needed to protect native biodiversity in the U.S. from IAS, especially on Pacific Islands. Such management actions include eradication of IAS, restoration of native habitat, development of robust policies that aim to prevent the further spread and establishment of IAS, and effective decision support tools. These actions will require coordinated leadership to improve recovery of T&ES, especially given the synergistic impacts of international trade and climate change.

AB  - Salt marsh productivity has historically been viewed as being driven primarily by bottom-up processes, but recent studies in North America, Europe, Asia and South America have shown that top-down forces by grazers also structure marsh vegetation. This generality of grazing pressure has not been tested to date in African salt marshes. Here, we investigated whether dominant crabs in South Africa's estuarine marshes consume live plants and whether that interaction has direct effects on the foundational species Spartina maritima. We employed natural surveys, lab feeding trials, diet analysis and field experiments. Although we found no significant relationships between crabs and marsh plant structure in surveys, gut contents and stable isotope analysis showed that S. maritima is present but not prominent in their diet. All S. maritima components were consumed. Manipulation of crab density and size structure in the field (crabs >5 mm excluded) revealed small effects on S. maritima stem density and aboveground biomass compared to controls. Combined, this research demonstrates that crabs in these South African marshes do indeed eat live cordgrass, and their effects appear to be density dependent. Top-down impacts on marsh plants were not detected by natural density correlations, probably due to the different scales at which data were collected compared to field experiments. These results establish that grazing of live foundational marsh plants is globally common. Future studies in these systems should manipulate crab density through addition experiments or predator exclusions to understand the impact of crabs at high densities and what forces regulate their populations.

AB  - Plant community productivity generally increases with biodiversity, but the strength of this relationship exhibits strong empirical variation. In meta-food-web simulations, we addressed if the spatial overlap in plants' resource access and animal space-use can explain such variability. We found that spatial overlap of plant resource access is a prerequisite for positive diversity-productivity relationships, but causes exploitative competition that can lead to competitive exclusion. Space-use of herbivores causes apparent competition among plants, resulting in negative relationships. However, space-use of larger top predators integrates sub-food webs composed of smaller species, offsetting the negative effects of exploitative and apparent competition and leading to strongly positive diversity-productivity relationships. Overall, our results show that spatial overlap of plants' resource access and animal space-use can greatly alter the strength and sign of such relationships. In particular, the scaling of animal space-use effects opens new perspectives for linking landscape processes without effects on biodiversity to productivity patterns.

AB  - Climate-induced mass bleaching events are one of the greatest threats to coral reefs, causing widespread loss of coral cover. Drivers of recovery and adaptation for coral reefs in the face of repeated large-scale disturbances are unclear, with marked differences across geographies. Using a monitoring dataset lasting from 2005 to 2018, we documented the response of coral reefs of northwest Mahe in the granitic Seychelles islands following the 1998 and 2016 mass bleaching events. We analysed trends in coral cover, coral community composition and key fish trophic group densities for 24 sites. Coral cover increased almost fourfold from 2005 to 2015 with 42.1% mean coral cover in 2015, highlighting a recovery from the 1998 bleaching event dominated by Acropora growth forms. Impacts of the 2016 bleaching event were less acute than the 1998 one. However, following the 2016 bleaching event, coral cover significantly decreased to 16.1% mean cover in 2017, marked by a sharp decrease of Acropora corals and branching growth forms. Corallivorous, herbivorous and piscivorous fish densities were positively correlated with coral cover from 2005 to 2016. These findings highlight the dominant role of Acropora in recovery from mass coral bleaching events. It also shows the importance of time-series datasets in understanding coral recovery dynamics and their use in an integrated management approach to building reef resilience.

AB  - Coral reefs are structurally complex habitats that provide diverse shelter for motile benthic invertebrates (MBI), including those with cryptic and nocturnal behaviors. In this study, diel changes in MBI structure (species composition, density, and biomass) and functions (trophic groups and isotopic diversity indices) were examined on coral reefs at Rapa Nui (27 degrees S, 109 degrees W). Diurnal and nocturnal surveys (March 2016) revealed that echinoderms were the dominant invertebrates throughout the diel cycle in terms of density, biomass, and their trophic role. The density and biomass of MBI were higher at night than during the day. Significant diel changes were detected in the structure of MBI and trophic groups, where the diurnal assemblages were mostly herbivores and the nocturnal assemblages were mostly detritivores. Moreover, the isotopic uniqueness index indicated that nocturnal MBI were trophically more redundant than their diurnal counterparts; consequently, the high nocturnal biodiversity did not necessarily increase trophic diversity. This time and trophic partitioning of MBI could have important consequences for energy transfer on the reefs and must be considered in future monitoring programs. Endemic taxa represented approximately a quarter of the species (26%), but had low density and biomass during both time periods, suggesting a modest influence on energy transfers on these coral reefs. However, their restricted geographic distribution and current low abundances could make these species vulnerable to extinction; therefore, management and conservation actions in the new multiple-use marine protected area of Rapa Nui should include these species.

AB  - The list of invasive mammals in the central part of the North Caucasus (Stavropol krai, Kabardino-Balkarian Republic, North Ossetia-Alania), including 18 taxa belonging to four orders (Chiroptera, Carnivora, Rodentia, Artiodactyla), is presented. The largest group according to the vectors of invasion into the fauna of the region is formed by intentionally introduced taxa: Sciurus vulgaris, Capreolus pygargus, Cervus nippon, Cervus elaphus, Dama dama, Bos grunneins, Bison bonasus bonasus, Procyon lotor, Nyctereutes procyonoides, Mustela vison, Ondatra zibethicus. The group of self-settling species includes five: Canis aureus, Pipipipstrellus kuhlii, Capreolus capreolus, Canis familiaris, and Rattus norvegicus. According to the degree of impact on the regional ecosystems, the most dangerous species among invasive mammals of the region are sika deer, nonnative subspecies of red deer, domestic yak, jackal, American mink, raccoon dog, and common raccoon. This occurs owing to their number and impact on native fauna, flora, and soil cover.

AB  - Camellia longzhouensis (Theaceae) is an endemic evergreen shrub or small tree with a distribution restricted to South China. It is listed as Grade-II in the National Key Protected Wild Plants List. In this study, we surveyed its distribution, examined its population structure, identified factors affecting its survival, and reassessed its extinction risk. We found that C. longzhouensis was only distributed in the Nonggang National Nature Reserve and the surrounding area. Its individuals only grew under the secondary forest canopy in the karst mountain. A total of 58 individuals of C. longzhouensis in three sub-populations were found. Soil fertility and understory light availability were the main habitat factors influencing the survival of C. longzhouensis. Anthropogenic disturbances and reproductive obstacles have caused a low seed-setting rate, poor seedling survival, and a lack of adult plants of C. longzhouensis in the natural habitat. The population structure of C. longzhouensis is spindle shaped, indicating poor natural regeneration and inhibited seedling recruitment. Cleistanthus petelotii had a significant positive interspecific interaction with C. longzhouensis in the community. Based on the information obtained here and IUCN criterion C2ai, we recommend that C. longzhouensis be categorized in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List as Critically Endangered. We also developed a comprehensive protection strategy, consisting of in situ conservation, ex situ conservation, reintroduction, and commercial utilization. This strategy can be readily applied to protect other endangered plants with economic value in karst poor regions.

AB  - The argan woodlands of South Morocco represent an open-canopy dryland forest with traditional silvopastoral usage that includes browsing by goats, sheep and camels, oil production as well as agricultural use. In the past, these forests have undergone extensive clearing, but are now protected by the state. However, the remaining argan woodlands are still under pressure from intensive grazing and illegal firewood collection. Although the argan-forest area seems to be overall decreasing due to large forest clearings for intensive agriculture, little quantitative data is available on the dynamics and overall state of the remaining argan forest. To determine how the argan woodlands in the High Atlas and the Anti-Atlas had changed in tree-crown cover from 1972 to 2018 we used historical black and white HEXAGON satellite images as well as recent WorldView satellite images (see Part A of our study). Because tree shadows can oftentimes not be separated from the tree crown on panchromatic satellite images, individual trees were mapped in three size categories to determine if trees were unchanged, had decreased/increased in crown size or had disappeared or newly grown. The current state of the argan trees was evaluated by mapping tree architectures in the field. Tree-cover changes varied highly between the test sites. Trees that remained unchanged between 1972 and 2018 were in the majority, while tree mortality and tree establishment were nearly even. Small unchanged trees made up 48.4% of all remaining trees, of these 51% showed degraded tree architectures. 40% of small (re-) grown trees were so overbrowsed that they only appeared as bushes, while medium (3-7 m crown diameter) and large trees (> 7 m) showed less degraded trees regardless if they had changed or not. Approaches like grazing exclusion or cereal cultivation lead to a positive influence on tree architecture and less tree-cover decrease. Although the woodland was found to be mostly unchanged 1972-2018, the analysis of tree architecture reveals that a lot of (mostly small) trees remained stable but in a degraded state. This stability might be the result of the small trees' high degradation status and shows the heavy pressure on the argan forest.

AB  - Premise Biodiversity is often only measured with species richness; however, this metric ignores evolutionary history and is not sufficient for making conservation decisions. Here, we characterize multiple facets and drivers of biodiversity to understand how these relate to bioregions and conservation status in the ferns of Japan. Methods We compiled a community data set of 1239 grid cells (20 x 20 km each) including 672 taxa based on >300,000 specimen records. We combined the community data with a phylogeny and functional traits to analyze taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity and modeled biodiversity metrics in response to environmental factors and reproductive mode. Hierarchical clustering was used to delimit bioregions. Conservation status and threats were assessed by comparing the overlap of significantly diverse grid cells with conservation zones and range maps of native Japanese deer. Results Taxonomic richness was highest at mid-latitudes. Phylogenetic and functional diversity and phylogenetic endemism were highest in small southern islands. Relative phylogenetic and functional diversity were high at high and low latitudes, and low at mid-latitudes. Grid cells were grouped into three (phylogenetic) or four (taxonomic) major bioregions. Temperature and apomixis were identified as drivers of biodiversity patterns. Conservation status was generally high for grid cells with significantly high biodiversity, but the threat due to herbivory by deer was greater for taxonomic richness than other metrics. Conclusions Our integrative approach reveals previously undetected patterns and drivers of biodiversity in the ferns of Japan. Future conservation efforts should recognize that threats can vary by biodiversity metric and consider multiple metrics when establishing conservation priorities.

AB  - Large mammalian herbivores (LMH) are important functional components and drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in grasslands. Yet their role in regulating food-web dynamics and trophic cascades remains poorly understood. In the temperate grasslands of northern China, we explored whether and how grazing domestic cattle (Bos taurus) alter the predator-prey interactions between a dominant grasshopper (Euchorthippus unicolor) and its avian predator the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica). Using two large manipulative field experiments, we found that in the presence of cattle, grasshoppers increased their jumping frequency threefold, swallows increased foraging visits to these fields sixfold, and grasshopper density was reduced by about 50%. By manipulatively controlling the grasshoppers' ability to jump, we showed that jumping enables grasshoppers to avoid being incidentally consumed or trampled by cattle. However, jumping behaviour increased their consumption rates by swallows 37-fold compared with grasshoppers that were unable to jump. Our findings illustrate how LMH can indirectly alter predator-prey interactions by affecting behaviour of avian predators and herbivorous insects. These non-plant-mediated effects of LMH may influence trophic interactions in other grazing ecosystems and shape community structure and dynamics. We highlight that convoluted multispecies interactions may better explain how LMH control food-web dynamics in grasslands.

AB  - Background: The aim of the present study was to measure the effect of forest islands and landscape features on wild boar distribution. To this end, a number of features were identified in both, the interior and the surrounding area of forest islands and wild boars use of agricultural space was measured using the pellet group method, in which wild boar feces were counted along 60 km of transects. Results: The use of agricultural areas by wild boars close to forest islands was influenced by the characteristics of the forest island interiors, including their length, the cover conditions, and the main tree species, which were pine, spruce, and alder. The use of agricultural areas far from the forest islands was influenced by stand age (negatively) and forest island width (positively). The intensity of agricultural area use was also influenced by the characteristics of the forest island surroundings, including the type of agricultural crop (rapeseed and cereals), the presence of other forest islands, and the presence of large forest patches, all of which were important factors. Conclusion: Knowledge of the characteristics of the interior of the forest islands as well as their surroundings that determine the use of the agricultural areas by wild boars can be utilized to select sites for intensifying hunting pressure or taking other actions to prevent damages to crops. This can lead to an increase in the effectiveness of wild boar population control and to a reduction in conflict between this species and humans.

AB  - The rangelands of Crete island (Greece) are typical Mediterranean habitats under high risk of degradation due to long-term grazing and harsh climatic conditions. We explored the effect of abiotic (climatic conditions, altitude) and biotic factors (long-term grazing by small ruminants) on the floristic composition and diversity of selected lowland (Pyrathi, Faistos) and highland (Vroulidia, Nida) rangelands. In each rangeland, the ground cover was measured, and the floristic composition was calculated in terms of five functional groups: grasses, legumes, forbs, phrygana, and shrubs. The aridity index, species turnover, species richness, Shannon entropy, and Gini-Simpson index (with the latter two converted to the effective number of species) were calculated. Our results reveal that highlands are characterized by the highest aridity index (wetter conditions). Lowland rangelands, compared to highland, exhibited a higher percentage contribution of grasses, legumes, and forbs, while species turnover decreased along the altitudinal gradient. The Shannon entropy index was correlated (a) positively with Gini-Simpson and mean annual temperature and (b) negatively with mean annual precipitation, aridity index, and altitude. Moreover, the Gini-Simpson index correlated positively with mean annual temperature and negatively with altitude. Our results could help to understand the effects of grazing on rangeland dynamics and sustainability in semi-arid regions in the context of climatic change.

AB  - Simple Summary: The Helan Mountains, located at the interface between China's arid and semi-arid zones, form a natural dividing line in the heart of the desert. Often described as a "desert oasis", this region functions as an ecological island with a uniquely distinctive geographical setting, making it a focal point for contemporary ecological research. The Alashan wapiti (Cervus canadensis alashanicus), an isolated population in this area, has become a key conservation concern for the Chinese government. Our multi-scale habitat assessments identified bare land as the principal limiting factor for the availability of suitable habitats for the species. Consequently, the protection and restoration of Alashan wapiti habitats are of critical importance, particularly in enhancing the quality of existing habitats. Our findings provide valuable scientific insights to support future conservation and management efforts in the Helan Mountains. The Helan Mountains, situated in the heart of the desert, act as a dividing line between China's arid and semi-arid zones. Often referred to as a "desert oasis", they create an ecological island with a uniquely distinctive geographical location, making this area a focal point of contemporary research. Ungulates play a critical role in this ecosystem. The Alashan wapiti (Cervus canadensis alashanicus), an isolated population of China's smallest wapiti (Cervus canadensis) subspecies, is found exclusively within the Helan Mountains Nature Reserve. The conservation of this isolated population is fraught with challenges, particularly during winter, the harshest season for northern ungulates. Winter habitats are crucial for ensuring population stability. Therefore, we used certain methods, such as factor screening and model parameter optimization to assess habitat suitability using multi-scale species distribution models. The optimized results show that suitable habitats overlap with areas of high vegetation coverage in the Helan Mountains, covering just 588.32 km(2), which is less than a quarter of the reserve's total area. The bare land area and winter NDVI are the two primary factors influencing habitat suitability, with other factors having minimal impact, underscoring the critical importance of food resources for the Alashan wapiti. The limited availability of these resources poses significant conservation challenges. Our findings provide a more precise foundation for targeted habitat protection and restoration efforts. We recommend enhancing the protection and restoration of food resources, effectively conserving vegetated areas, and preventing desertification.

AB  - In 2015-2019, basic ecological parameters were assessed in the roe deer C. capreolus population in the Zielonka Forest near Poznau (western Poland). The aim of the study was to determine the causes of the declining density of this species. The assessment of abundance with help by drivers moving in a line formation (direct counting in control plots) showed an average of 3.4 individuals per km 2 of the forest, and the dominance of females over males - an average of 2.6 S? Per 1 d . The population was characterized by typical fertility - 1.8 corpus luteum per ovulating female, but very low productivity - 0.3 fawns per female in the autumn population. The determined average age in the adult females population was typical for this species - 4.0 years. The average eviscerated body mass was: males 15.6 kg, females 14.2 kg, and fawns 9.3 kg. Despite the lower density of roe deer in the Zielonka Forest than in the 1970s, their body mass not only did not increase but was about 10% smaller. It was found that the main reason for the low density of roe deer was the extremely low production in a population characterized by low body weight. Deterioration of food resources was identified as the reason for the decrease in body mass. Most likely, this happened as a result of the reduced presence of herbaceous vegetation (including under the canopy of deciduous trees or the invasive American bird cherry P. serotina ) and the fact that most forest plantations were fenced with nets (often the only sunny areas in this forest). This has reduced the availability of food niches where roe deer - a species that feeds selectively - could find food rich in nutrients. The increase in the number of fallow deer D. dama in Zielonka Forest also had a negative impact, as they are competitors on the roe deer population.

AB  - Interspecific competition from introduced and naturally colonizing species has potential to affect resident populations, but demographic consequences for vertebrates have rarely been tested. We tested hypotheses of interspecific and intraspecific competition for density, body mass, and fertility of adult female Roe Deer (Capreolus capreolus) across a heterogeneous forest landscape occupied by two introduced deer species: Mediterranean Fallow Deer (Dama dama); and subtropical Reeve's Muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi). Species-specific deer densities in buffers around culling locations of 492 adult female Roe Deer, sampled over seven years, were extracted from spatially explicit models calibrated through annual nocturnal distance sampling. Roe Deer fertility and body mass were related to species-specific deer densities and extent of arable lands using piecewise structural equation models. Reeve's Muntjac density was lower at higher Fallow Deer densities, suggesting interspecific avoidance via interference competition, but greater when buffers included more arable land. Roe Deer body mass was marginally greater when buffers included more arable land and was independent of deer densities. However, Roe Deer fertility was unrelated to female body mass, suggesting that fertility benefits exceeded an asymptotic threshold of body condition in this low-density population. However, Roe Deer fertility was slightly greater rather than reduced in areas with greater local Roe Deer density, suggesting negligible intraspecific competition. In contrast, Roe Deer was less fertile in areas with greater Reeve's Muntjac densities; thus, interspecific exceeded intraspecific competition in this assemblage. In contrast, we found no support for any effects of Fallow Deer density on Roe Deer density, body mass, or fertility. Complex networks of interspecific competition operating in this deer assemblage include: interspecific interference from Fallow Deer exceeded habitat effects for Reeve's Muntjac; and interspecific competition from introduced, smaller sedentary Reeve's Muntjac reduced fertility, unlike intraspecific, or potential competition with larger, more mobile, Fallow Deer for native Roe Deer. Mechanisms driving Roe Deer fertility may include interspecific behavioral interference or stress-resource depletion is considered less likely because Roe Deer fertility was independent of body mass. Findings emphasize the importance of ensuring appropriate management strategies for controlling invasive species.

AB  - Aim: Rapid loss in global insect diversity has generated substantial public worry due to their critical ecological roles. However, there is controversy about the effectiveness of the global-scale hotspots in guiding the conservation of diversity at the regional scale. Even worse, little is known about the knowledge of insect distributional dynamics in many understudied regions, such as East and Southeast Asia. Here, to guide for setting regional-scale conservation priorities for insect diversity, we explore hawkmoths (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) for their distributional dynamics and identify regional hotspots requiring protection.
   Location: South China (including Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Hong Kong and Macau) and northern Vietnam (17 degrees similar to 26.5 degrees N, 102 degrees similar to 117.5 degrees E).
   Methods: Species distribution models were generated for 194 hawkmoth species based on 3597 occurrence records to predict their distributions. We calculated the spatial patterns of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity and identified regional hotspots. Furthermore, the potential assembly mechanisms underlying insect diversity were explored by analysing the rates of speciation, extinction and dispersal between phyloregions.
   Results: (a) The coastal regions of South China and northern Vietnam represent a regional hotspot of hawkmoths in East and Southeast Asia, with significantly higher alpha-diversity than that in inland regions. (b) Dispersal played a more important role than local speciation and extinction in the formation of regional hawkmoth hotspots.
   Main Conclusions: In this study, the 'Out-of-the-tropics model' can explain the formation of the hawkmoth regional hotspots and the enhanced version of the 'Pure dispersal model' can explain the formation of the hotspots in Hainan Island. Compared with the local speciation and extinction, dispersal is the main driving factor that promoted the formation of the regional biodiversity hotspot of hawkmoths in South China. The case of Hainan Island suggests that protection within hotspots needs to account for specific regional macro-evolutionary dynamics rather than indiscriminate coverage of identified hotspots.

AB  - Fire-killed serotinous trees are often dominant species in fire-prone regions with contrasting wet and dry seasons. We studied a serotinous fire-killed conifer (Callitris preissii, Cupressaceae) to identify the influence of fire regime and climate on geographic variation in level of serotiny, recruitment and population structure. We measured population size distributions, seedling recruitment and level of serotiny for sample stands across a climatic gradient from mesic coastal (including two islands) to semi-arid inland sites in SW Australia. Trees on islands were mostly non-serotinous and were only weakly serotinous on the adjacent mainland in the higher rainfall West coast region. In the semi-arid Goldfields and South inland, and the higher rainfall South coast region, trees were more strongly serotinous with up to six cohorts of closed cones retained on trees. Level of serotiny was stronger at the drier end of the climatic gradient where severe to extreme fire danger weather occurs most frequently, and where vegetation type (e.g., shrublands) supports frequent crown-type, stand-replacing fires. Recruitment was most abundant post-fire in all regions, but seedlings also established inter-fire where there was regular seed fall due to low level of serotiny or spontaneous release of seeds from old cones on trees with a high cone load. Population structures for mainland stands shifted from approximately reverse-J (indicating continuous recruitment) in mesic regions to mainly unimodal (establishment mostly after fire) in drier, inland regions, although some long-unburned inland stands showed occasional inter-fire recruitment, likely linked to high rainfall years. Unimodal population structures characterized islands, where previous studies have identified herbivory on seedlings by refugial populations of native macropods as a limiting factor on inter-fire establishment. Understanding landscape context, response to disturbance, biotic interactions and reproductive traits of dominant species is essential in conservation planning in a rapidly changing global environment.

AB  - Herbivory influences plant evolution, the assembly of plant communities, and patterns of biological invasions. This study examined rodent herbivory patterns on the survival of native and non-native plant seedlings following fires in the Mojave Desert. We also assessed the extent of these effects on seedlings that use different life history strategies: grasses, forbs, and shrubs. Using a full-factorial design, we tested the individual and interactive effects of past fires and rodent exclusion on seedling survival. Five native and four non-native invasive plant species common in the Mojave Desert were grown to the seedling stage and placed in randomized order in the experimental plots. We assessed seedling survival after seven days. Survival was nearly two-fold greater for non-native seedlings (85%) than native seedlings (47%, p = 0.002). Rodents decreased native seedling survival from 59 to 36% (p = 0.002) but did not affect non-native seedling survival. Rodents decreased shrub (58-31%, p = 0.006) and forb seedling survival (76-57%, p = 0.04) but did not affect grass seedling survival. Rodents showed the greatest preference for Larrea tridentata (creosote), Sphaeralcea ambigua (desert globemallow), and Erodium circutarium (red stem stork's bill). Post-fire conditions significantly decreased the seedling survival of native shrub, Yucca brevifolia (Joshua tree), with 47% survival in unburned plots but no survival in burned plots (p = 0.003). Fire history did not significantly impact other species or influence patterns of rodent herbivory. These results suggest that low rodent preference for grass seedlings may partially contribute to the success of non-native grass invasions in the Mojave Desert.

AB  - The fringing reefs in Opunohu Bay and Cook's Bay in Moorea, French Polynesia are an important component of Moorea's fringing reef system, as they comprise approximately 20% of the island's perimeter. The two bays are assumed to have differing benthic communities due to differences in onshore land development and freshwater input, but observational studies of their benthic communities are rarely published. To address this information gap, we conducted a quadrat-based benthic survey to determine important drivers of coral spatial variation throughout the bays. Interestingly, we found that coral taxonomic richness and cover did not significantly vary between bays, and corals only declined at the sites nearest freshwater input. Instead, coral richness was significantly greater when the territorial herbivorous damselfish Stegastes nigricans was present. The majority of the corals we documented were relatively small (88% < 10 cm diameter), thus our results support a positive effect of S. nigricans on young coral diversity. Stegastes nigricans could potentially be creating a refuge inside their territories from scraper herbivores for many non-dominant corals, although other potential mechanisms and the context of these benefits warrant further investigation. We conclude that, on the fringing reefs of Moorea's two major bays, spatial variation in coral richness is more strongly associated with patches of S. nigricans territories than larger-scale differences in onshore land development and distance from freshwater input.

AB  - Species abundance, diversity and community assemblage structure are determined by multiple physical, habitat and management drivers that operate across multiple spatial scales. Here we used a multi -scale coral reef monitoring dataset to examine regional and local differences in the abundance, species richness and composition of fish assemblages in no -take marine reserve (NTMR) and fished zones at four island groups in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia. We applied boosted regression trees to quantify the influence of 20 potential drivers on the coral reef fish assemblages. Reefs in two locations, Magnetic Island and the Keppel Islands, had distinctive fish assemblages and low species richness, while the Palm and Whitsunday Islands had similar species composition and higher species richness. Overall, our analyses identified several important physical (temperature, wave exposure) and biological (coral, turf, macroalgal and unconsolidated substratum cover) drivers of inshore reef fish communities, some of which are being altered by human activities. Of these, sea surface temperature (SST) was more influential at large scales, while wave exposure was important both within and between island groups. Species richness declined with increasing macroalgal cover and exposure to cyclones, and increased with SST. Species composition was most strongly influenced by mean SST and percent cover of macroalgae. There was substantial regional variation in the local drivers of spatial patterns. Although NTMR zoning influenced total fish density in some regions, it had negligible effects on fish species richness, composition and trophic structure because of the relatively small number of species targeted by the fishery. These findings show that inshore reef fishes are directly influenced by disturbances typical of the nearshore Great Barrier Reef, highlighting the need to complement global action on climate change with more targeted localised efforts to maintain or improve the condition of coral reef habitats.

AB  - The Alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster), an endangered species with fewer than 200 individuals in fragmented habitats of the Helan mountains, faces pronounced seasonal resource fluctuations. This study investigates seasonal shifts in diet composition, nutrient intake, and tolerance to secondary plant metabolites via fecal microhistological and feed proximate analyses conducted from 2014 to 2016. In summer, the diet included 31 plant species, dominated by mosses (18.15 %), Prunus sibirica (11.32 %), and Salix spp. (10.94 %), whereas winter diets of 30 species shifted toward woody and herbaceous plants such as Lonicera edulis (13.68 %) and Astragalus chingianus (11.33 %), with complete exclusion of mosses. Significant seasonal variations were observed in the Water (W) and Crude ash (CA) content, with higher levels recorded in summer. The relative density of food intake was significantly positively correlated with CA in summer and with Ether extract (EE) in winter. Response surface models revealed specific seasonal foraging patterns: in winter, musk deer prefer high-energy and high-protein foods, with tolerance to higher tannin level, while in summer, they favor low-protein and high-tannin foods, irrespective of energy content. These findings highlight the adaptive capacity of Alpine musk deer to cope with seasonal resource fluctuations in Helan mountains, contributing to their survival and reproductive success, and thus inform conservation strategies that emphasize habitat connectivity and protection of critical foraging areas to ensure long-term viability.

AB  - Predators regulate communities through top-down control in many ecosystems. Because most studies of top-down control last less than a year and focus on only a subset of the community, they may miss predator effects that manifest at longer timescales or across whole food webs. In southeastern US salt marshes, short-term and small-scale experiments indicate that nektonic predators (e.g., blue crab, fish, terrapins) facilitate the foundational grass, Spartina alterniflora, by consuming herbivorous snails and crabs. To test both how nekton affect marsh processes when the entire animal community is present, and how prior results scale over time, we conducted a 3-year nekton exclusion experiment in a Georgia salt marsh using replicated 19.6 m2 plots. Our nekton exclusions increased densities of plant-grazing snails and juvenile deposit-feeding fiddler crab and, in Year 2, reduced predation on tethered juvenile snails, indicating that nektonic predators control these key macroinvertebrates. However, in Year 3, densities of mesopredatory benthic mud crabs increased threefold in nekton exclusions, erasing the tethered snails' predation refuge. Nekton exclusion had no effect on Spartina biomass, likely because the observed mesopredator release suppressed grazing snail densities and elevated densities of fiddler crabs, whose burrowing alleviates soil stresses. Structural equation modeling supported the hypotheses that nektonic predators and mesopredators control invertebrate communities, with nektonic predators having stronger total effects on Spartina than mud crabs by controlling densities of species that both suppress (grazers) and facilitate (fiddler crabs) plant growth. These findings highlight that salt marshes can be resilient to multiyear reductions in nektonic predators if mesopredators are present and that multiple pathways of trophic control manifest in different ways over time to mediate community dynamics. These results highlight that larger scale and longer-term experiments can illuminate community dynamics not previously understood, even in well-studied ecosystems such as salt marshes.

AB  - Aim We analyse the oldest available data on the high-elevation vegetation on Tenerife's Mt. Teide, namely the species shown in A. von Humboldt's (1817) Tableau Physique des Iles Canaries (TPIC), which is based on his own 1799 visit and an 1815 visit by L. von Buch and C. Smith. The analysis is of interest in the context of climate change and biotic changes, such as the eradication of non-native goats from the Teide National Park. Between 1944 and 2010, the summit region of Mt. Teide has warmed at a rate of 0.14 degrees C/decade. Location Mt. Teide on Tenerife, Canary Islands. Taxon Vascular plants. Methods We updated the taxonomy of the 197 species shown in the TPIC, data-mined publications and letters, searched relevant herbaria for surviving collections, and compared historic and modern species presence, absence and elevational ranges. Results Both Humboldt and Buch had to use formulas to convert barometer readings into elevations above sea level, and none of Humboldt's collections and few of Buch's are linked to precise elevations. The upper range limits of all 23 species for which we found data have shifted upward, with the average shift being 36.4 m per decade (1799/1815-2021). Four species that today are abundant were not recorded in 1815, suggesting population expansion, probably due to goat eradication. Main conclusions While our data cannot disentangle the effects of climate change and changing herbivory, they provide the earliest available record on the vegetation on Mt. Teide and illustrate the magnitude of change.

AB  - Long-term livestock grazing has shaped landscapes, biodiversity, societies, cultures, and economies in the North Atlantic over time. However, overgrazing has become a major environmental sustainability challenge for this region, covering the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, and Scotland. The objective of this study was to elicit narratives and spatial patterns of local people's management preferences for sheep grazing in the Faroe Islands through a socio-cultural lens. We collected data via a Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) survey with an open question about hopes and concerns for sheep management in the Faroe Islands and a mapping exercise for expressing spatial preferences for sheep management. Four distinct narratives emerged from a qualitative analysis of responses to the open question (n = 184): (1) Sustainable sheep management, (2) Nature without sheep, (3) Sheep as part of Faroese culture, and (4) Sheep as nuisance. Visual inspection of narrative-specific maps with locations where either no or fewer sheep were preferred indicated that sheep management is not simply a 'sheep vs. no sheep' issue but embedded in a more nuanced consideration of the place of sheep in the landscape and society. For example, for some residents sheep-farming is not a commercial enterprise but a social activity and local source of food. Our combined methodological approach using qualitative and spatial data can help researchers in other fields identify the interplay between place-specific areas of grazing management concern and socio-cultural values, enabling more targeted land-use management policies or plans.

AB  - Coastal land reclamation dramatically alters ecosystem structure and trajectories of ecological succession, yet knowledge about soil faunal colonization and community assembly in reclaimed coastal land is scarce. In this study, we investigated taxonomic and functional shifts in soil nematode communities following reclamation in sites at Hengsha Island, China. Six reclamation stages were identified based on reclamation age and vegetation type, including tidal flat, 1-year bare field, 3-year halotolerant pioneer community, 5-year grassland, 10-year, and 50-year secondary forests. We collected data on the morphological and life history traits of soil nematodes, including body size, cephalic setae, amphids, tail shape, life history strategy, and feeding habit, to assess the functional responses of nematodes to different reclamation stages. We found a significant decrease in both taxonomic and functional diversity as tidal flats were converted to dry land, followed by a gradual recovery that progressed with increasing reclamation age. Significant shifts in the taxonomic and functional composition of soil nematode communities were also observed. Tidal flat reclamation decreased the relative abundance of marine nematodes with cephalic setae, large amphids and clavate/conicocylindrical tails. With increasing reclamation age, bacterivores and r-strategists with conical and long tails were displaced by fungivores, herbivores, and K-strategists with rounded tails. These shifts were driven by changes in soil water content, organic matter, plant communities, and stress factors, such as pH and salinity. Our findings highlight the critical role of morphological and life history traits in understanding how soil nematode communities adapt to human-induced environmental changes, providing valuable insight into the long-term ecological impacts of coastal reclamation on soil biodiversity.

AB  - The Dolphin and Union (DU) caribou herd (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus x pearyi), locally referred to as Island caribou, is a unique and at-risk ecotype of caribou that ranges on Victoria Island and the adjacent mainland in the central Canadian Arctic. To facilitate the incorporation of traditional knowledge (TK) and better inform the required species recovery plan, we analyzed an archived set of TK interviews done in Ekaluktutiak and Kugluktuk, Nunavut, in 2003. The overarching theme throughout the interviews was that the DU caribou were dynamic, constantly adapting to the changing environment around them. Accounts provided previously unexplored connections between temporal and spatial trends in DU caribou distribution, population, ecology, and disease syndromes. Findings of fewer animals, range shift, and increased observations of disease in the late 1990s and early 2000s suggest that early signs of the declines that have resulted in the herd being reassessed as endangered today were already apparent to Kugluktukmiut in 2003. In contrast, Ekaluktutiakmiut were seeing a stable population. Shifts in caribou range and consequently harvesting ranges were described by both communities, but more evident in Kugluktuk. When combined, the differing accounts of the two communities provided a deeper understanding of caribou ecology and trends across seasons, years, and a broad spatial range. Community differences demonstrate the cruciality of considering unique place-based perspectives and the importance of mobilizing TK from communities and knowledge keepers throughout the caribou range for a herd-level understanding. This study highlights the importance of timely analyses and reporting on TK studies to ensure a nimble conservation response in a rapidly changing environment.

AB  - Regional patterns of fish diversity, abundance, distribution, and assemblage composition are driven by a combination of biotic and abiotic conditions in the marine environment, but these conditions can be altered through anthropogenic activities, such as those associated with oil and gas extraction. The present study utilises data on fish relative abundance and diversity obtained from 1546 baited remote underwater video deployments conducted between 2004 - 2019 in depths of 9 - 170 m across 2000 km of coastline in north-west Australia on natural habitats and subsea pipelines to understand the influence of oil and gas infrastructure on fish assemblages. A total of 450 fish taxa from 56 families was observed, with populations dominated by generalist and invertebrate carnivore taxa. At the regional scale, subsea pipelines had lower diversity (lower taxonomic richness) than natural environments, but possessed a higher abundance of piscivorous and herbivorous fish taxa. Clear patterns in fish assemblage composition were observed in multivariate analyses, reflecting the proximity of oceanic shoals and banks, depth, and to a lesser extent, oil and gas infrastructure. Shallow-water and close to shoals assemblages were characterised by a diversity of site-attached (e.g., wrasses, tuskfish), reef-associated taxa (e.g., emperors). Mesophotic fish assemblages were characterised by commercially important (e.g., goldband snapper), wide-ranging (e.g., sharks) and sand-affiliated (e.g., toadfish, threadfin bream) taxa. Proximity to pipelines and platforms ranked low as predictors in the multivariate analyses suggesting a negligible regional influence of these structures on fish communities in comparison to depth and shoal habitats. Local-scale influences of subsea infrastructure, however, may be important for some fish species (infrastructure vs. immediate surrounds). Our study highlights the influence of abiotic factors on regional-scale patterns in fish assemblage structure across north-west Australia.

AB  - Deer affect their habitats in various ways. Many previous studies on the ecological functions of deer have investigated the impact of herbivory on vegetation but have rarely focused on other functions. In this study, we evaluated the seed dispersal function of the sika deer (Cervus nippon yesoensis) in Hokkaido Island, examining the process from foraging to germination. We (1) surveyed the composition of seeds dispersed by wild deer, (2) measured seed recovery rate and gut passage time by feeding trials using three fleshy-fruited trees (Vitis coignetiae, Actinidia arguta, and Rosa rugosa), (3) conducted germination tests using defecated intact seeds, and (4) estimated seed dispersal distance and its seasonal changes using GPS movement data. In total, 73 seedlings of at least 10 species emerged from 181 fecal samples, each weighing similar to 1 g. The proportion of intact seeds after gut passage varied greatly with plant species and among trials (0.0%-55.0%). The germination rate of intact defecated seeds was similar to (R. rugosa and V. coignetiae) or higher (A. arguta) than that of manually washed seeds. The average seed dispersal distances during the resident period were 594 m for V. coignetiae and 610 m for A. arguta. The average seed dispersal distances during the migration period increased to 3140 m for V. coignetiae and 3617 m for A. arguta, and sometimes exceeded 18,000 m. These findings highlight that sika deer can disperse seeds over long distances, thus contributing to gene flow between distant populations and range expansion to suitable habitats.

AB  - Population expansion of deer and the damage to planted trees caused by them is becoming a serious conflict between deer and humans. Although there are many methods for tree protection, their effectiveness varies from case to case, and the determinant of effectiveness has rarely been clarified. We investigated the following three specific questions: 1) What factors influence forest managers' choice of protection methods? 2) What factors were important in reducing tree damage by each protection method? 3) Which of the repellents and fences was more effective in reducing tree damage? In 2018, we obtained data of plantation tree damages caused by sika deer (Cervus nippon) and tree protection methods from 1424 plantations in Japan. No protection was chosen at low deer densities, and repellents and fences were chosen at middle and high densities by forest managers. In the case of repellents, the damage rank increased with increasing deer density, tree age, and maximum snow depth, but was not affected by planted tree species (Cryptomeria japonica and Chamaecyparis obtusa). In the case of fences, the damage rank increased with increasing deer density, tree age, maximum snow depth, slope, and decreasing net height. The damage rank also increased with the usage of separable digging prevention net and the net without stainless wire. When the age of planted trees is seven, repellents can suppress the tree damage under 50% only when the deer density is below 10 deer/km2 (no snow) or 6 deer/km2 (snow depth is 16 cm). Fences can suppress tree damage below 50% when deer density was below 38 deer/km2 (snow depth: 0, slope: 35 degrees) or 25 deer/km2 (snow depth: 16, slope: 35 degrees). Deer protection methods should be selected according to environmental conditions such as deer density, snow depth, and slope degree in the case of our treated tree species.

AB  - Understanding ecological niche is critical to the management and conservation of any species or population. For herbivores, dietary niche is critical for understanding habitat suitability, carrying capacity, and population and community viability. In closely related species with similar morphologies, dietary niches can diverge depending on environmental and seasonal factors. Elk Island National Park in Alberta, Canada, contains populations of both American bison (Bison bison) subspecies-plains bison (B. b. bison) and wood bison (B. b. athabascae)-in similar but separate habitats located at the historical confluence of the subspecies' distributions. Using generalized additive models and nutritional geometry, we compared the subspecies' dietary niches in terms of content and quality continuously for one year (Dec 2020 - Nov 2021). Both subspecies consumed primarily graminoids during winter, spring, and fall and incorporated a variety of forbs and woody plants during summer. Plains bison diets contained more upland grasses and digestible organic matter in their diet and less wetland graminoids (e.g., sedges) throughout the year. We also found differing dietary niches between the subspecies during the spring and summer months. Our unique, continuous analysis of annual diet content and quality can deliver insight into the similarities and differences between subspecies' dietary niches that should help improve management decisions, such as better matching between source populations and release areas for future translocations.

AB  - Wild pigs, including wild boar (Sus scrofa) , feral domestic pig (Sus scrofa domestica), are associated with negative impacts in their native and introduced ranges. We compiled wild pig occurrence reports and utilized Maximum Entropy modelling to predict their potential distribution in ecoregions overlaying Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay. An analysis of their observed and potential distributions was carried out in relation to four biodiversity hotspots and 3766 protected areas to estimate the number of units and percent area currently and potentially invaded. Among biodiversity hotspots, Atlantic Forest, Cerrado , Chilean Winter Rainfall-Valdivian Forests included 44.7% of wild pig records. The proportion of suitable area was 85% in Atlantic Forest, 61.3% in Cerrado, 37.5% in Chilean Winter Rainfall-Valdivian Forests, and 5.6% in Tropical Andes. The number of protected areas with known wild pig presence was led by Uruguay (100%), followed by Chile (20.3%), Argentina (15.8%), Paraguay (9.5%), Bolivia (6.5%), and Brazil (4.7%). The proportion of protected areas with predicted wild pig presence was highest in Uruguay (100%), followed by Paraguay (72.6%), Brazil (58.0%), Argentina (57.4%), Chile (42.2%), and Bolivia (35.9%). Our work represents the first assessment of wild pig potential distribution in South America and highlights the potentially devastating impacts of wild pigs on the regional biodiversity and national conservation targets, especially at mega-diverse areas. We present a dynamic web application that can be readily consulted by scientists, managers , decision makers to improve wild pig control and risk mitigation actions in the study region.

AB  - Waterlogged alpine peatlands harbour substantial reserves of recalcitrant soil organic carbon (SOC) that is mainly decomposed by soil fungi. Even a slight fluctuation in peatland SOC can considerably alter C emissions, thereby impacting the future trajectory of climate change. These peatlands are often subject to yak grazing, which can affect ecosystem functions. However, how grazing regulates microbially mediated temporal variations in SOC in alpine peatlands remains largely unclear. Therefore, we conducted a field experiment on the Zoige Plateau to explore the effects of grazing on peatland soil C content and its association with soil fungal communities during different seasons (spring, summer, and autumn). Grazing significantly increased SOC in spring but not in the subsequent seasons. Furthermore, grazing significantly increased soil water contents in summer, dissolved organic carbon contents in autumn, and N-acetyl-(3-D-glucosaminidase and leucine aminopeptidase activities in spring and autumn, but decreased phenol oxidase activity in spring and summer. Grazing significantly reduced fungal diversity at alpha and (3 scales. The coefficient of variation of SOC was significantly reduced by grazing, whereas similar trends were not observed for dissolved organic carbon or for dissolved organic and inorganic nitrogen. In the fenced area, the coefficient of variation of fungal species richness was the most important factor for predicting that of SOC. In the grazed area, coefficient of variation of soil NH4+-N contributed the most to that of SOC. These findings underscore the pivotal role of fungal community in affecting SOC dynamics in alpine peatlands, which is crucial for understanding the ecological processes that maintain soil C cycling in alpine ecosystems.

AB  - Island ecosystems provide natural laboratories to assess the impacts of isolation on population persistence. However, most studies of persistence have focused on a single species, without comparisons to other organisms they interact with in the ecosystem. The case study of moose and gray wolves on Isle Royale allows for a direct contrast of genetic variation in isolated populations that have experienced dramatically differing population trajectories over the past decade. Whereas the Isle Royale wolf population recently declined nearly to extinction due to severe inbreeding depression, the moose population has thrived and continues to persist, despite having low genetic diversity and being isolated for similar to 120 years. Here, we examine the patterns of genomic variation underlying the continued persistence of the Isle Royale moose population. We document high levels of inbreeding in the population, roughly as high as the wolf population at the time of its decline. However, inbreeding in the moose population manifests in the form of intermediate-length runs of homozygosity suggestive of historical inbreeding and purging, contrasting with the long runs of homozygosity observed in the smaller wolf population. Using simulations, we confirm that substantial purging has likely occurred in the moose population. However, we also document notable increases in genetic load, which could eventually threaten population viability over the long term. Overall, our results demonstrate a complex relationship between inbreeding, genetic diversity, and population viability that highlights the use of genomic datasets and computational simulation tools for understanding the factors enabling persistence in isolated populations.

AB  - In subarctic mountain birch forests, reindeer grazing and moth outbreaks act as important biotic drivers of ecosystem functioning. We investigated how a long-term contrast in reindeer grazing regimes and short-term ungulate exclusion affected soil fungal and bacterial communities in mountain birch forests recovering from a recent moth outbreak. We separately described the impacts on microbial communities for organic and mineral soil layers. Differences in fungal communities were mainly explained by variations between grazing regimes, whereas the four-year exclusion of ungulates had little effect. Soil microbial communities showed a high level of specificity between organic and mineral layers. Our results suggest that long-term grazing may have cascading impacts, especially on ectomycorrhizal fungal communities. In contrast, ericoid mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungal communities and soil bacterial communities were less affected by grazing and appeared to be more resilient to aboveground herbivory in mountain birch forests recovering from a moth outbreak.

AB  - The decomposition of herbivore dung and plant litter are two crucial ecological processes that maintain the biogeochemical cycles and functions of grazing grassland ecosystems. Herbivore dung deposition causes heterogeneous microenvironmental conditions (e.g., temperature, moisture, nutrients, and microbial activities), yet its influence on litter decomposition and the involved biotic and abiotic processes remains underexplored. This study conducted a three-year dung-litter decomposition experiment in a yak-grazed alpine pasture on the Tibetan Plateau to examine how dung deposition influences soil microclimate, litter chemical quality, extracellular enzyme activities, and microbial communities, and how these factors collectively regulate the decomposition of Elymus nutans litter, a dominant plant species in the region. Results showed that dung deposition accelerated litter mass loss by 22 %, primarily by enhancing the degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose. Dung deposition raised soil temperature by 1.5 degrees C and increased moisture content by 19 % on average, and enriched litter chemical quality by reducing the carbon to nitrogen (C: N) ratio and increasing N, dissolved organic C, and dissolved organic N content. It also boosted the activities of lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, including (3-1,4glucosidase (BG), (3-1,4-xylosidase (BX), (3-D-cellobiosidase (CBH), xylanase (XYL), peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase. Changes in microbial communities were distinct: bacterial communities responded strongly in the first two years, driven by improved litter chemistry and the introduction of dung-derived bacteria, while fungal community shifts occurred mainly in years 2-3, influenced by C and N dynamics (e.g., C: N ratio). Dung deposition increased the abundances of bacterial phyla such as Bacteroidota and Proteobacteria, which correlated positively with cellulase activity (BG, BX, CBH, and XYL) and the degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose in litter. Structural equation modeling revealed that the acceleration of litter decomposition by dung deposition was predominantly mediated by bacterial communities and their associated enzymatic activities. Overall, this study underscores the pivotal role of herbivore dung deposition in accelerating litter decomposition via regulating bacterial-driven processes. The findings offer valuable insights for grassland management and enhance predictions of herbivore dung deposition impacts on ecosystem functions under global herbivore expansion.

AB  - Questions Can multi-decadal vegetation changes in a decommissioned brown coal mine be attributed to global-change forcing? Given novel drivers of community assembly and ongoing global change, what are sensible restoration goals and strategies for large post-industrial areas? Location A decommissioned brown coal mine near Soby, central Denmark (56 degrees 01 ' 45 '' N, 9 degrees 04 ' 4 '' E). Methods We resurveyed the plant communities of the mine 31 years after an initial survey. Changes in the prevalence of exotic species and species indicator values for environmental conditions were used to link the observed vegetation changes to global change factors. Results The plant communities, including their unmined reference sites, changed over the 31-year period toward plant communities with higher proportions of exotics, nitrophilous, warmth- and moisture-indicating species, and species of low foraging quality for deer. The changes are consistent with the novel drivers of community assembly at the site, such as the introduction of exotic species, increased nitrogen deposition, elevated temperatures, steadily increasing groundwater level post mining, and the massive comeback of red deer. Conclusions The global-change forcing of novel plant communities suggests that it is becoming increasingly difficult to restore historical references. It may thus be more sensible to acknowledge novelty and adopt an open-ended approach for the restoration of this and similar post-industrial areas, e.g. using rewilding principles to promote biodiverse self-sustaining ecosystems.

AB  - Forests in northeastern North America have undergone dramatic transformations due to losses and gains of species, changes in land use and pollution. Historic stressors combined with new threats of white-tailed deer and non-native earthworms are threatening native plant diversity. We developed a transplant approach to gauge the importance of deer and earthworms in allowing understorey species recovery. This approach, instead of censusing existing individuals, avoids problems imposed by past land use, dispersal limitation or climate change. We selected 20 native species in different taxonomic and functional groups, with different palatability to herbivores, different life-history strategies and a range of plant traits (%N, specific leaf area [SLA]) and our selection included species indicative of primary or secondary forests. Using a 2 x 2 full factorial design, we planted species into fenced and unfenced plots with and without existing earthworm invasions in five secondary hardwood forests. We measured survival, plant growth and reproduction over 4-6 years. Earthworm biomass was associated with increased survival of 13 and decreased survival of five species. Surviving transplants grew taller (eight of 12 species measured) and wider (seven of nine species measured) in earthworm plots but were more likely to be attacked by insects. Excluding deer benefitted most species' survival and growth. Taxonomic class, SLA or foliar N did not affect species sensitivity to deer or earthworms. Synthesis. Secondary forests in our region continue to provide suitable habitat for native species. Earthworms and deer are major structuring forces affecting survival and growth of our transplant species, but their impacts are species-specific and change over time. We observed poorly recognized indirect negative impacts of deer on many unpalatable species. Taxonomic class and differences in plant traits offered no important insights regarding vulnerability to deer or earthworms. Transplanting native species into secondary forests can succeed in restoring understorey communities, but will require fencing or substantial deer population reductions to be successful long term.

AB  - Eradicating feral pigs from island ecosystems can assist in restoring damaged biodiversity values and protect commercial industries such as agriculture. Although many feral pig eradications have been attempted, management decisions are often led by practitioner experience rather than empirical evidence. Few interventions have been guided by population models to identify harvest intensity necessary to achieve eradication within a specified time frame, nor have they applied data on control effort and costs to evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of proposed control strategies. We used effort and cost data from a feral pig-control program on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, over 17 months to derive functional-response relationships between control effort (in hours per pig) and pig abundance for four control methods: (1) ground-based shooting, (2) trapping with remote triggers, (3) poison baiting, and (4) thermal-assisted aerial culling. We developed a stochastic Leslie matrix with compensatory density feedback on survival to project population trajectories from an initial population (N-0) of 250 female pigs with an estimated island-wide carrying capacity (K) of 2500 over 3 and 10 years for populations subjected to an annual harvest of 35%-95%. We built functional-response models to calculate annual effort and cost for six cull scenarios across all harvest rates. We derived total cost and effort over 3- and 10-year projections from the sum of annual cost and effort within the projection intervals. Pig populations were reduced to <10% N(0 )based on harvest rates >80% and 60% for culls of 3- and 10-year durations, respectively. In all scenarios above, the minimum required harvest rate and the total cost to reduce population to <= 10% of N-0 decreased with increasing harvest proportion, with lower total costs incurred over 3 years compared to 10 years. The simulations suggest that the most cost-effective approach for most scenarios is to maximize annual harvest and complete eradication effort over the shortest periods.

AB  - IntroductionDiet selection of grazing livestock is one of the critical factors affecting the diversity and composition of plant communities in grasslands, with consequent impacts for ecosystem functioning. Co-grazing of multiple livestock species could create additive or complementary effects on plant communities due to diet overlap or differentiation among livestock species. However, there is only limited knowledge about diet overlap and differentiation of co-occurring livestock species and whether or how these diet characteristics change with grassland degradation.Materials and MethodsWe experimentally test the diets of two commonly co-occurring livestock species (cattle and sheep) and the dietary niche partitioning/overlap between them in non-degraded, moderately and severely degraded grasslands.ResultsCattle exhibited broader diet than sheep, and diet overlap between species was lower in non-degraded grasslands. As grassland degradation increased the availability of annual plants, interspecific niche overlap between cattle and sheep gradually increased, and cattle suffered a resulting dietary niche compression. Sheep maintained a relatively narrow and constant dietary breadth.ConclusionThe increasing dietary niche overlap between livestock species with increasing extent of grassland degradation indicated increased additive effects of cattle and sheep co-grazing on plant community, and thus stronger effects on plant community composition and diversity.
   Livestock grazing is one of the most intensive land-use activities in grasslands. Revealing how livestock diets and interspecific niche partitioning/overlap change in response to grassland degradation are of high interest for conservation and management of grasslands. image

AB  - Sargassum horneri, a brown macroalga, recently invaded the California coast, including into critical foundational communities such as kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) forests. Despite its rapid spread, empirical tests that evaluate mechanisms underlying S. horneri's invasion success are lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted three field experiments on temperate rocky reefs in southern California using growth as a proxy for invasion success. We first tested whether S. horneri success differed with herbivory strength and native diversity by conducting a 2factor experiment varying site (with different baseline levels of urchin densities and native algal diversity) and urchin access. We found S. horneri growth only differed among urchin treatments and not sites. We then evaluated whether S. horneri could successfully invade established algal canopies as a driver or whether it required open space as a passenger via a 2-factor experiment varying S. horneri size (small, medium, large) and canopy type (S. horneri, kelp, -canopy). We found that all S. horneri sizes grew fastest when canopy was lacking and light was high and slower in both canopy habitats with lower light; overall, small S. horneri grew slowest. Finally, we evaluated whether herbivore consumption for native species could facilitate S. horneri's invasion by conducting a 2-factor experiment varying species (M. pyrifera, S. horneri) and herbivore access. We found uncaged algae were consumed and caged algae grew, but there was no difference between species. Taken together, our results suggest that S. horneri is a "passenger" invader that will take advantage of points in time and space where light is plentiful, such as when M. pyrifera is removed via disturbance. Further, our results suggest that herbivory and native algal diversity are likely not key determining factors of the invasion success of S. horneri.

AB  - Converting coniferous plantations to mixed plantations influences the microbial community composition and potential functions during litter decomposition. However, it is unclear how litter decomposition and associated microbial communities are interactively affected by litter mixing and environmental factors. Here, an in situ litter decomposition experiment was conducted to investigate the dynamics of microbial diversity in mixed litter (at a mass ratio of 1:1) from coniferous (Pinus massoniana) and broadleaf tree, including Bretschneidera sinensis, Manglietia chingii, Cercidiphyllum japonicum, Michelia maudiae, and Camellia oleifera. We found that the mass loss from mixed litter was higher than that of monospecific litter. The chemical characteristics of the broadleaf tree species included in the mixed litter significantly affected the microbial community composition and diversity, and those effects increased over time. Compared to the monospecific litter, the mixed litter had a higher relative abundance of saprotrophs and microbial functional groups related to carbon and nitrogen cycling. Moreover, litter chemistry (i.e., pH, lignin and cellulose content) and environmental factors (i.e., air temperature and soil moisture content) were the most crucial factors affecting the microbial decomposer community. Our results suggest that introducing broadleaf tree species with high litter quality to coniferous plantations changes the composition and function of microbial communities related to litter decomposition, which is conducive to accelerating litter decomposition in subtropical plantations.

AB  - Introduction: Understanding human-wildlife interactions is critical to overcoming the socio-environmental crises we face worldwide. Among these interactions, poaching and hunting, human-wildlife conflict, and transmission of zoonotic diseases are major causes of biodiversity loss and detrimental to human well-being. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze wildlife poaching, feral pig hunting, human-wildlife conflict, and health issues in a region of the Brazilian Cerrado, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. The study also focused on the lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), a poached species listed as vulnerable to extinction.Methods: From October 2016 to September 2017, we conducted face-to-face semi-structured interviews with 51 local people from nine stakeholder groups. Interview answers and additional information compiled during the study were evaluated using coding, narrative, and co-occurrence analyses.Results and discussion: We found that the main human-wildlife conflict in the region involves feral pigs, and hunting is practiced as a population control strategy. The lowland tapir is not considered a conflictual species, as it is beloved by most people. However, tapirs are still poached, although less so than in the past, mainly for cultural reasons. Culture was the main motivation behind wildlife poaching in general. We identified 28 species and five taxa currently poached in this Cerrado region, of which 11 are used for medical and aphrodisiac purposes. Historically, wildlife poaching was linked to poor livelihood conditions and lack of support from governmental institutions during the Agrarian Reform process, becoming a cultural habit over the years. Nevertheless, wildlife poaching is less frequent than in the past, and its main barriers are surveillance, poaching prohibition by landowners, and social norm. Therefore, promoting a change in the way people relate to nature, meeting socioeconomic needs, and increasing surveillance appear to be important conservation strategies. Although feral pig hunting may replace wildlife poaching, some hunters still poach wild species, especially peccaries. Hence, it is necessary to keep hunters under surveillance, raise awareness among them, and make them allies in conservation strategies. We found a worryingly low level of awareness about disease transmission risk through bushmeat manipulation and consumption, highlighting the importance of One Health approaches.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Whereas vertebrate scavengers have a higher diversity reported at randomly placed carcasses, the drivers of insect diversity on carrion, such as the exposure type (fixed versus random) or the carrion species, are still incompletely understood. We analyzed beetle diversity at differently exposed carcasses in the low-range mountain forest of the Bavarian Forest National Park in Germany. We tested if scavenging beetles, similarly to vertebrate scavengers, show a higher diversity at randomly placed carcasses compared to easily manageable fixed places. Ninety-two beetle species at 29 exposed wildlife carcasses (roe, red deer, and red foxes) were detected. Beetle diversity was higher at fixed locations possessing extended highly nutrient-rich cadaver decomposition islands as important refuges for threatened red-listed species, such as Necrobia violacea (Coleoptera: Cleridae). Particularly noticeable in our insect traps were the following two rare species, the "primitive" carrion beetle Necrophilus subterraneus (Coleoptera: Agyrtidae) and the false clown beetle Sphaerites glabratus (Coleoptera: Sphaeritidae). In Europe, only the species S. glabratus out of the genus Sphaerites is present. This emphasizes the importance of carrion for biodiversity conservation. We clearly show the relevance of leaving and additional providing wildlife carcasses in a dedicated place in protected forests for preserving very rare and threatened beetle species as essential members of the decomposing community.
   In contrast to other necromass, such as leaves, deadwood, or dung, the drivers of insect biodiversity on carcasses are still incompletely understood. For vertebrate scavengers, a richer community was shown for randomly placed carcasses, due to lower competition. Here we tested if scavenging beetles similarly show a higher diversity at randomly placed carcasses compared to easily manageable fixed places. We sampled 12,879 individuals and 92 species of scavenging beetles attracted to 17 randomly and 12 at fixed places exposed and decomposing carcasses of red deer, roe deer, and red foxes compared to control sites in a low range mountain forest. We used rarefaction-extrapolation curves along the Hill-series to weight diversity from rare to dominant species and indicator species analysis to identify differences between placement types, the decay stage, and carrion species. Beetle diversity decreased from fixed to random locations, becoming increasingly pronounced with weighting of dominant species. In addition, we found only two indicator species for exposure location type, both representative of fixed placement locations and both red listed species, namely Omosita depressa and Necrobia violacea. Furthermore, we identified three indicator species of Staphylinidae (Philonthus marginatus and Oxytelus laqueatus) and Scarabaeidae (Melinopterus prodromus) for larger carrion and one geotrupid species Anoplotrupes stercorosus for advanced decomposition stages. Our study shows that necrophilous insect diversity patterns on carcasses over decomposition follow different mechanisms than those of vertebrate scavengers with permanently established carrion islands as important habitats for a diverse and threatened insect fauna.

AB  - Desert grasslands are essential components of dryland ecosystems, providing critical ecosystem services and supporting livestock production. However, they are highly susceptible to degradation due to climatic and human influences. While current research has examined grazing impacts, the nonlinear effects of grazing intensity on soil- vegetation interactions remain poorly understood. This study addresses this gap by indentifying ecological thresholds beyond which desert grassland ecosystems undergo abrupt deterioration. We investigated the desert grasslands of Urad Middle Banner, Bayannur, Inner Mongolia, China, using vegetation and soil sampling along with a questionnaire survey, to assess grazing intensity effect. Our analysis, incorporating correlation analysis and a threshold regression model, revealed that grazing intensity has nonlinear effects on both vegetation and soil. When the grazing intensity exceeds 270 sheep units per kilometre, abrupt decreases in aboveground biomass, total potassium, and alkalihydrolysed nitrogen occur. Similarly, at a threshold of 68 sheep units per kilometre, sudden increases in soil organic carbon and sudden decreases in the root-to-shoot biomass ratio are observed. These thresholds mark critical transition points, beyond which ecosystems feedback mechanisms accelerate irreversible degradation. Our findings offer a novel perspective on early diagnostic indicators of desert grassland degradation and provide a scientific basis for sustainable grazing management. By identifying grazing limits that maintain ecosystem stability, this study informs ecological restoration efforts and policy frameworks aimed at mitigating desertification risks in drylands.

AB  - Context. Aerial shooting from a helicopter targeting introduced sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) is a key activity being undertaken on public land in the North East and East Gippsland regions of Victoria. However, there is currently little published information on the efficacy of aerial shooting for reducing sambar deer populations in Australia. Aims. The aims of this study were to analyse the operational data collected during an aerial shooting program in eastern Victoria, to assess the efficacy of aerial shooting at reducing sambar deer density and to inform management decisions on the required intensity of aerial shooting to achieve target densities. Methods. Operational data (locations of all shot animals as well as aerial search effort) were analysed from 10 sites using a Bayesian generalised catch-effort model, which allowed for population changes between five periods of intensive control. The model allowed estimates of initial and residual abundance for each site to be made from the catch-effort data, which were used to estimate the efficacy of aerial shooting. Estimates of the detection rate of deer, which were allowed to vary with removal occasion and site, were then used to estimate the amount of aerial search effort required to reduce population densities by various proportional amounts. Key results. Aerial shooting resulted in population reductions of 50-70% of sambar deer at four sites where aerial search intensities per unit area were highest. However, results at the remaining sites suggest that sambar deer densities have either remained static or increased over the five periods of aerial control. Recruitment of sambar deer between control periods, which was strongly influenced by study site elevation and season, was largely responsible for eroding reductions achieved by aerial shooting. Conclusions. Catch-effort models applied to operational data collected during aerial shooting programs can be used to estimate control efficacy without the need for additional monitoring. Our analysis suggests that sufficiently high search intensities, around 1.4 km of search effort per km(2) of habitat in each of five removal occasions, would need to be applied to achieve at least a 50% reduction in sambar deer densities.

AB  - Degradation from overgrazing of global arid rangelands is of significant concern for this widespread terrestrial ecosystem, and the people who rely on its sustainable use. Addressing this degradation requires a better understanding of how livestock removal and conservation management actions affect the rehabilitation of land condition. However, the dominant effect of climate and meteorological variability on arid vegetation makes isolating management-induced change a difficult task. We present an analytically simple method for measuring relative land condition by assessing differences in remote-sensing-derived persistent fractional vegetation between adjacent stocked and destocked regions over time. The 22-year observation period focusses on vegetation recovery at a long-established sheep station after the removal of livestock and the introduction of conservation-focussed management. The study region, in the southern Australian arid rangelands, comprises sparsely vegetated chenopod shrublands and acacia woodlands across low-lying plains. Comparison is made to immediately surrounding stocked properties in a spatial design where climate and biogeographic variables remain consistent across the study area. We found an unequivocal relative increase in vegetation cover, and reduction of bare ground cover at the destocked property that became evident approximately 8 years after a reduction in grazing pressure. Distinctly higher persistent vegetation cover was maintained, even during periods of drought. Non-photosynthetic vegetation cover was most indicative of long-term change and increased by 1.1% relative to surrounding areas. Photosynthetic vegetation cover increased by 0.5%, while bare ground cover decreased by 2.1%. These cover changes, particularly in the non-photosynthetic vegetation and bare ground components spatially coincide with the fenced boundary of the destocked property. Synthesis and applications: The ability to quantify management-related impacts in land condition using freely available remote sensing data could support improved management by all stakeholders in these regions. The method leverages readily available satellite remote sensing data in a study design that is not dependent on large geospatial and climatic datasets that are not necessarily available in remote regions.

AB  - In forest ecosystems, the browsing activity of large wild herbivores (LWH) often leads to reduced tree and plant diversity, diminished biomass production, and challenges in achieving forest management objectives. Our case study focuses on assessing the impact of LWH browsing during the initial stages of forest growth by comparing fenced plots (F plots) with excluded LWH and control plots (C plots) with the presence of LWH. The experiment took place at the Hukavsk & yacute; Gr & uacute;& ncaron; research site in the Po & lcaron;ana Mts., characterized by a high red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) population. Fifteen F plots and fifteen C plots, all situated within mixed maternal forests, were established in the 2023 growing season. Thus, circular plots with a radius of 2.5 m were utilized, and comprehensive data were collected on young trees (excluding those under 10 cm in height), covering tree species, positions, heights, and stem diameters. Species-specific allometric relations were employed to calculate the aboveground biomass of each tree, contributing to the overall biomass stock on a plot basis. A comparison between F and C plots revealed a prevalence of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) in F plots, while European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) dominated C plots. F plots exhibited higher tree species diversity (4.5 species), contrasting with the lower diversity (2.0 species) and absence of silver fir in C plots. The F plots also demonstrated greater tree density and sizes, resulting in substantial differences in aboveground biomass stocks. Browsing in C plots predominantly affected tree height rather than stem diameter, leading to a bigger height-to-diameter ratio in F plots compared to C plots. We suggest that fencing as a method to exclude LWH might be economically expensive and provide a temporary solution limited by the functionality of the fence. Therefore, the primary strategy for safeguarding the future of silver fir may lie in regulating LWH populations to a reasonable threshold.

AB  - A previous study on the encroachment of North American northern red oak Quercus rubra L. into the mesic Scots pine forest (in central Poland) revealed high abundances of seedlings and saplings under shrubs, with lower abundances in open areas or clumps of bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus L. It was unclear whether the regeneration success of Q. rubra is enhanced by the presence of shrubs due to their "nurse effect", and how burying acorns of different sizes in soil or moss affects the survival of oak seeds and seedlings (a "burial effect"). Results of a previous observational study were verified in an experimental study: a pool of 900 large-, medium-, and small-sized acorns was sown under moss cover in open areas and within bilberry clumps and in soil under shrubs in 2018 and monitored for 3 years in natural conditions. The majority of sown acorns were lost, mainly due to acorn pilferage, lack of germination and the death of sprouting acorns. However, acorn and seedling survival depended significantly on acorn size and differed among the microsites studied. Viable seedlings were twice as likely to develop from large- and medium-sized as from small-sized acorns, and they grew mainly from acorns sown under moss cover, confirming a positive "burial effect." Seedling survival was three times higher in bilberry and open areas, than under shrubs; however, seedlings "nursed" by shrubs were less threatened by large ungulates. Only a small part of the pool of sown acorns contributes to the reproductive success of Q. rubra in the mesic Scots pine forest. Microsites characteristic to this type of forest are suitable for northern red oak regeneration; however, bilberry favors acorn survival and germination and early seedling growth, moss cover favors acorn survival and germination, while shrubs protect surviving seedlings from herbivory.

AB  - The potential for megafauna restoration is unevenly distributed across the world, along with the socio-political capacity of countries to support these restoration initiatives. We show that choosing a recent baseline to identify species' indigenous range puts a higher burden for megafauna restoration on countries in the Global South, which also have less capacity to support these restoration initiatives. We introduce the Megafauna Index, which considers large mammal's potential species richness and range area at the country level, to explore how the responsibility for megafauna restoration is distributed across the world according to four scenarios using various temporal benchmarks to define species' indigenous range - current, historical (1500 AD), mid-Holocene and Pleistocene. We test how the distribution of restoration burden across the world correlates with indicators of conservation funding, human development and governance. Using a recent or historical baseline as a benchmark for restoration puts a higher pressure on African and south-east Asian countries while lifting the responsibility from the Global North, where extinctions happened a long time ago. When using a mid-Holocene or Pleistocene baseline, new opportunities arise for megafauna restoration in Europe and North America, respectively, where countries have a higher financial and societal capacity to support megafauna restoration. These results contribute to the debate around benchmarks in rewilding initiatives and the ethical implications of using recent baselines to guide restoration efforts. We suggest that countries from the Global North should reflect on their responsibility in supporting global restoration efforts, by both increasing their support for capacity building in the Global South and taking responsibility for restoring lost megafauna at home.

AB  - A unique shift in benthic community composition, where scleractinian corals are replaced by coralline algae, has been observed on coral reefs in Guam in the western Pacific. Guam's reefs have been subjected to intense fishing pressure and impaired water quality for decades. Since 2013, heat stress has emerged as an additional major threat to the island's coral reefs. After a severe coral bleaching and mortality event in 2017, branching coralline algae of the genus Lithophyllum rapidly overgrew dead coral skeletons of the ecosystem engineer Acropora abrotanoides and have since become major components of forereef communities over a broad depth range. By now, the persistence of increased Lithophyllum cover meets the temporal criterium of phase shifts, but accurate estimates on the degree of dominance over appropriate spatial scales are lacking due to the absence of reliable baseline data. The ecological impacts of coral reef transitions towards increased coralline cover are unclear. Whereas carbonate budgets and reef growth could remain positive in the long term, the downstream effect of changes in structural complexity, (micro)habitat diversity, and benthic community composition on ecological processes and reef-associated faunal assemblages is unknown.

TI  - Long-term persistence of desert rodent species in a Great Basin sagebrush community: potential effects of fire, invasive annuals, and warming temperatures
T2  - WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST

KW  - SMALL MAMMALS
KW  - GRASSES
AB  - To test long-term stability of a desert rodent community and potential impacts of wildfire on the community's stability, we live-trapped desert rodents from 2019 to 2021 at a site in western Nevada where we had previously trapped from 1989 to 1993. Trapping occurred in unburned sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) and in adjacent burned habitat where sagebrush cover was removed by a fire in 1985. We also used online data to test for trends in estimated cover of annual and perennial vegetation and in ambient temperatures and precipitation over the > 30-year period spanned by the trapping data. White-tailed antelope squirrels (Ammospermophilus leucurus) were captured significantly more frequently in unburned habitat than in burned habitat, and though they were previously captured (infrequently) in the burned habitat, they were not captured there in new trapping efforts. Among heteromyid rodent species, 2 kangaroo rats (Merriam's kangaroo rat [Dipodomys merriami] and Panamint kangaroo rat [D. panamintinus]) were also kangaroo rats switched over time, as they were previously captured more often in burned habitat but were much more common in the unburned habitat in new trapping sessions. Ord's kangaroo rat (D. ordii) was the only species captured significantly more often in the burned habitat, where their capture frequencies have also increased in comparison with old data. Three heteromyid species that were previously captured (infrequently) were not trapped in new trapping sessions. These apparent changes in rodent numbers over time were accompanied by increased ambient temperatures and, in the burned habitat, by an increase in annual plant cover (mainly introduced cheatgrass [Bromus tectorum]) and a decrease in herbaceous perennials (mainly Indian ricegrass [Achnatherum hymenoides]). Changes in the rodent community probably resulted from these vegetation changes, which in turn may at least partly result from the warming trend.

AB  - The 2018 arrival of African swine fever (ASF) in China was followed by reports of wild pig deaths across most countries in Southeast Asia. However, the magnitude and duration of population-level impacts of ASF on wild pig species remain unclear. To elucidate the spatiotemporal spread of ASF in the region for native pig species, we gathered qualitative information on wild pig population dynamics in Southeast Asia between 2018 and 2024 from 88 expert elicitation questionnaires representing sites in 11 countries. Peak reported population declines occurred in 2021 and 2022, with more than half of respondents reporting declining wild pig populations, far higher than in earlier years. The reported declines waned to 44.23% in 2024, whereas simultaneously, the number of populations reported to be "increasing" increased from 11.3%-13.2% in 2019-2022 to 28.9% in 2024. These reports suggest that the ASF outbreak may have peaked for wild boars and bearded pigs in mainland Southeast Asia, Borneo, and Sumatra, with some subsequent recovery. However, the disease is still expanding into the ranges of island endemic species, such as new reports for the Sulawesi warty pig (Sus celebensis) in September of 2024. Island endemics remain particularly vulnerable to extinction from ASF and require urgent monitoring and conservation action.

AB  - Biological invasions produce negative impacts worldwide, causing massive economic costs and ecological im-pacts. Knowing the relationship between invasive species abundance and the magnitude of their impacts (abundance-impact curves) is critical to designing prevention and management strategies that effectively tackle these impacts. However, different measures of abundance may produce different abundance-impact curves. Woody plants are among the most transformative invaders, especially in grassland ecosystems because of the introduction of hitherto absent life forms. In this study, our first goal was to assess the impact of a woody invader, Pinus contorta (hereafter pine), on native grassland productivity and livestock grazing in Patagonia (Argentina), building abundance-impact curves. Our second goal, was to compare different measure of pine abundance (density, basal area and canopy cover) as predictors of pine's impact on grassland productivity. Our third goal, was to compare abundance-impact curves among the mentioned measures of pine abundance and among different measures of impact: total grassland productivity, palatable productivity and sheep stocking rate (the number of sheep that the grassland can sustainably support). Pine canopy cover, closely followed by basal area, was the measure of abundance that best explained the impact on grassland productivity, but the shape of abundance impact curves differed between measures of abundance. While increases in pine density and basal area always reduced grassland productivity, pine canopy cover below 30% slightly increased grassland pro-ductivity and higher values caused an exponential decline. This increase in grassland productivity with low levels of pine canopy cover could be explained by the amelioration of stressful abiotic conditions for grassland species. Different measures of impact, namely total productivity, palatable productivity and sheep stocking rate, drew very similar results. Our abundance-impact curves are key to guide the management of invasive pines because a proper assessment of how many invasive individuals (per surface unit) are unacceptable, according to envi-ronmental or economic impact thresholds, is fundamental to define when to start management actions.

AB  - Mountain forest dynamics and ecosystems services are critically influenced by disturbances, in particular storm events. After extensive disturbance, the large amount of deadwood lying on ground and the necessity for restoring the forest cover with natural regeneration are two critical issues to be dealt with. Salvage logging is the most common post-disturbance management strategy, but it does not consider the strategic role of coarse woody debris (CWD) in favoring regeneration establishment and survival. The aim of this study is to analyze how CWD contributes to creating favorable microsites for regeneration, increasing seedling establishment probability, after a large windthrow in the eastern Italian Alps. We focused on two different facilitative mechanisms provided by CWD, microsite amelioration and seedling protection, by planting a set of seedlings in the surroundings of deadwood elements. The former mechanism was analyzed by measuring temperature and SWC (Soil Water Content) locally, while for the latter we recorded evidence of browsing at the end of the season. For each trial, we established control sites in empty areas nearby with no CWD presence in order to infer its contribution. The results show that north-facing microsites on south-exposed slopes offer significantly lower temperature and fewer water stress for saplings, in comparison to south-facing microsites. More in general, saplings on deadwood-mitigated microsites are less exposed to desiccation, which mitigates the transplanting shock and facilitates the establishment. Moreover, the presence of lying deadwood increases roughness and, as a consequence, the cost for browsers to reach the seedlings. Using a coefficient expressing this increment, we underline the significant protective effect of CWD against deer browsing. The results of our study highlight the importance of deadwood in providing favorable regeneration microsites, enhancing the probability of sapling establishment and survival, protecting them from deer browsing.

AB  - Invasions of exotic herbivores often result in considerable damage to vegetation. Slugs are one of the herbivores that pose a high risk of altering vegetation when introduced to new sites. The large invasive slug, Limax maximus, was recently introduced into Japan. We examined its feeding behavior to assess potential effects on vegetation at introduced sites. We conducted two complementary experiments: feeding trials and DNA meta-barcoding analyses. In the feeding trials, we provided L. maximus with 23 test plants and calculated Acceptability Index (AI) values to evaluate palatability. Limax maximus clearly favored specific plants; average AI was highest for Brassica oleracea, followed by Lactuca indica, and Sambucus racemosa. DNA meta-barcoding analyses identified plants from six families in the feces of wild individuals. According to the generalized linear mixed model analyses, the plants that L. maximus preferred to eat were crops, herbaceous plants, and plants with glabrous leaves. Because native slugs and land snails do not show these preferences, L. maximus may exert herbivory pressure on native and agricultural plants that is different from that exerted by native molluscan communities. Our work demonstrated that combining multiple methods helps to estimate the potential risk of exotic herbivory in natural ecosystems. Additional research should examine how L. maximus influences forest vegetation structure and crop productivity in areas where it is introduced.

AB  - In Poland, bovine tuberculosis (BTB) is most often detected in cattle, although some cases have also been reported in pigs and in other non-domestic species. BTB is believed to be mainly present in the Bieszczady region, in the south-eastern part of the country. The present study analyses the practical applications of the law regarding the eradication of tuberculosis among European bison in Poland, as well as the influence of legal rules in species conservation effects. Its aim is to present and evaluate the effectiveness of legal provisions in selected cases of BTB detected in European bison. The analysis highlights key "critical points" in the management of cases of BTB in European bison, which resulted from the problematic interpretation and application of the existing legal provisions. Findings indicate that before the Animal Health Law, the eradication of BTB in European bison in Poland was not regulated clearly enough by the applicable laws in force prior to 2021. This posed a threat to an effective reintroduction strategy for bison based on creating larger metapopulations and maintaining small, isolated reservoir herds (breading centers) for fallback in the case of infectious disease. It should be emphasized that in the current legal system, there is no doubt that a District Veterinary Officer has the competence to prevent and control tuberculosis in European bison.

AB  - Cattle fever ticks, Rhipicephalus microplus and Rhipicephalus annulatus, transmit Babesia pathogens, the causative agents of cattle fever worldwide. Although eradicated from the United States, increasing incursions of cattle fever ticks in Texas have put considerable strain on the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CFTEP). The movement of ticks between wildlife and cattle along the Texas-Mexico border complicates control efforts. Here, we used habitat suitability models, the literature, and quantitative survey data to project the distributions of native and introduced ungulates in Texas. Specifically, we used habitat suitability models and downscaling to estimate potential overlap between cattle and free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) that may carry cattle fever ticks and generate maps of estimated tick exposure risk. Our findings suggest that the introduction and spread of exotic ungulates, such as the nilgai antelope, may facilitate the expansion of cattle fever ticks within and beyond the historical quarantine zone established in 1943. The increasing range of nilgai populations could enhance landscape connectivity for cattle fever ticks in sensitive areas along the Texas-Mexico border. By combining these models with cattle inventory data, we provide tools to help the CFTEP better allocate resources, monitor tick populations, prevent incursions, and implement early interventions.

AB  - Underwater imagery survey was conducted to address changes in Antarctic benthic megafauna communities by recent glacial retreat in Marian Cove, where distance from the glacier was proportional to retreat period. Benthic megafauna communities showed lesser variation due to frequent ice-scouring at 10 m than deeper seabed. At deep seabed (50-90 m), where glacier impacts decreased, benthic megafauna was scarce right in front of the glacier, but near the glacier (similar to 10 years after seabed exposure), density peaked (128 ind. m(-2)) with pioneer species. At the outermost site, pioneer species were extremely limited (5 ind. m(-2)) while late-successional species were abundant (42 ind. m(-2)). Taxonomic and functional diversities peaked near the glacier and outermost site, respectively, indicating different mechanisms of structural and functional change after glacial retreat. This study showed a four-step successional process of benthic megafauna communities after glacial retreat in Antarctic nearshore: high disturbance, colonization, transition, and maturing stages.

AB  - The Kashmir musk deer ( Moschus cupreus ) is a globally endangered species hunted for its musk pod. Despite its endangered status, it remains one of the least studied species of musk deer. In 2019, the genetic discovery of Kashmir musk deer in Mustang district of Nepal - outside of its historically known range in Kashmir, India - opened up new avenues for research on this elusive species. Communication among individuals of musk deer is primarily based on latrine sites, which serve various purposes such as territorial marking and reproductive signaling. Hence, this study aims to investigate the association between microhabitat and latrine sites of Kashmir musk deer in the Mustang, Nepal. A systematic survey was conducted to identify latrine presence and absence sites at an elevational gradient. Data on biophysical parameters, including altitude, slope, aspect, tree height, shrub height, and regeneration height were recorded for both latrine presence and absence plots. Significant differences in tree height and regeneration height, crown cover, and trail width were observed between the presence and absence plots. Latrine presence and absence data fitted with the generalized linear model using logistic function, revealed that the interaction between tree height and regeneration height plays a pivotal role in determining the suitability of a particular site within the habitat for establishing a latrine site. This significant positive interaction indicated that the probability of discovering latrines significantly increases when the areas have taller trees and taller regeneration. This finding affects microclimate factors, such as sunlight exposure, wind speed, soil moisture, and temperature, influencing their role in sustaining scent retention in the latrine sites. Incorporating knowledge about the association between microhabitats and latrine sites can aid in preserving suitable habitats that are critical for establishing communication among individual musk deer. This information can inform various conservation efforts, including captive breeding programs, anti -poaching operations, and reintroduction initiatives.

AB  - Fauna of North America's Great Plains evolved strategies to contend with the region's extreme spatiotemporal variability in weather and low annual primary productivity. The capacity for large-scale movement (migration and/or nomadism) enables many species, from bison to lark buntings, to track pulses of productivity at broad spatial scales (> 1 000 km(2)). Furthermore, even sedentary species often rely on metapopulation dynamics over extensive landscapes for long-term population viability. The current complex pattern of land ownership and use of Great Plains grasslands challenges native species conservation. Approaches to managing both public and private grasslands, frequently focused at the scale of individual pastures or ranches, limit opportunities to conserve landscape-scale processes such as fire, animal movement, and metapopulation dynamics. Using the US National Land Cover Database and Cropland Data Layers for 2011-2017, we analyzed land cover patterns for 12 historical grassland and savanna communities (regions) within the US Great Plains. On the basis of the results of these analyses, we highlight the critical contribution of restored grasslands to the future conservation of Great Plains biodiversity, such as those enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program. Managing disturbance regimes at larger spatial scales will require acknowledging that, where native large herbivores are absent, domestic livestock grazing can function as a central component of Great Plains disturbance regimes if they are able move at large spatial scales and coexist with a diverse array of native flora and fauna. Opportunities to increase the scale of grassland management include 1) spatial prioritization of grassland restoration and reintroduction of grazing and fire, 2) finding creative approaches to increase the spatial scale at which fire and grazing can be applied to address watershed to landscape-scale objectives, and 3) developing partnerships among government agencies, landowners, businesses, and conservation organizations that enhance cross-jurisdiction management and address biodiversity conservation in grassland landscapes, rather than pastures.

AB  - Kelp forests, one of the world's most productive ecosystems, have been in decline in many regions in recent years. Climate change, through steady sea warming or marine heatwaves, has led to the disappearance of entire populations, although kelp forest decline may also depend on non-climatic stressors such as grazing. Since the impacts of climate change are projected to continue to intensify for decades, marine protected areas (MPAs) have been suggested as a cost-effective strategy to boost the resilience of marine ecosystems. However, implementing an MPA does not guarantee that all components of the local community will benefit from it. In NW Spain, several stakeholders reported the decline of Laminaria ochroleuca inside the Islas Atlanticas Marine National Park in recent years, but the extent and possible drivers of this decline have not been investigated. Using a combination of quadrat-scale (abundance, biomass) and transect-scale (cover) seasonal surveys over one year, we found striking differences between L. ochroleuca reefs inside and outside the MPA. Populations outside the MPA were the typical canopy forests expected for a perennial kelp, stable year-round and composed mostly of adults. Inside the MPA, however, grazing prevented the canopy phase from being reached. Instead, only mid-sized young plants were detected in autumn, but most had disappeared by winter, and those that remained had been degraded by herbivores to mere blade-less stipes with no growth meristem that eventually perish. Further research seems warranted to monitor whether this phenomenon spreads to nearby kelp beds outside the MPA. Meanwhile, restoring MPA kelp reefs will more likely require efforts to reduce herbivore activity (e.g. translocations, exclusion devices) than to bolster kelp populations. HIGHLIGHTS center dot Kelp canopies recurrently failed inside a MPA in recent years.center dot Neither propagule supply nor environmental conditions explain the failure.center dot Grazers keep a canopy-free state by eradicating recently recruited kelps.

AB  - Large predators are essential in maintaining ecosystem functioning, and comprehending how their feeding habits change across natural and human-dominated landscapes is crucial to preserve biodiversity. In this study, the diet of Iberian wolves (Canis lupus signatus) during pup rearing season (July to September) has been studied in relation to prey abundance and putting emphasis in the analysis of the differences between zones, wolf groups and individual factors (age, sex and social status). For this, non-invasive monitoring was carried out in three zones of Spain where nine different wolf breeding groups were detected (Galicia, n = 4; Zamora, n = 4 and Valladolid, n = 1). Faecal samples were collected near breeding sites for dietary and genetic analyses, registering if it was or not a scent mark to know the social status of the individuals. Prey availability was determined by camera trapping or requesting the official census of wild prey in the study areas. We found differences in wolf's diet depending on the zone and the breeding group however, the diet did not vary depending on the age, sex and social status. In general, Iberian wolves mainly fed on wild ungulates (wild boar, roe deer and red deer), feeding on the most abundant prey, except for Baldriz group in Galicia which seems to be specialized in hunting roe deer. Domestic animals' consumption (sheep, goat, donkey, pig) was not high, but it occurred specially in agriculture and livestock areas (Ferreras in Zamora and Valladolid) where wild prey were less available.
   Significance statement
   In this study, we shed light on the vital role of Iberian wolves in the ecosystem by investigating the dietary preferences during pup rearing season across different landscapes. Our research revealed differences in wolf diets based on geographic location and breeding groups, emphasizing their adaptability. We found that age, sex, and social status did not significantly influence their dietary preferences. Iberian wolves predominantly target wild ungulates, except for a specialized group in Galicia. Our study introduces a novel approach as it is the first to analyse wolf diet based on individual factors and using nitrogen analysis. Additionally, the study highlights previously overlooked dietary patterns of the Iberian wolf subspecies, despite its critical role in the ecosystem as a top predator. Furthermore, we emphasize the necessity of conserving wild ungulate populations to reduce livestock attacks by ensuring a stable supply of wild prey, promoting coexistence between humans and wolves.

AB  - Aims Both extreme drought and insect herbivores can suppress plant growth in grassland communities. However, most studies have examined extreme drought and insects in isolation, and there is reason to believe that insects might alter the ability of grasslands to withstand drought. Unfortunately, few studies have tested the interactive effects of extreme drought and insect herbivores in grassland communities. Methods Here, we tested the drought-herbivore interactions using a manipulative experiment that factorially crossed extreme drought with the exclusion of insect herbivores in a temperate semiarid grassland in Inner Mongolia. Important Findings Our results demonstrated that both extreme drought and insect herbivores separately decreased total plant cover. When combined, insect herbivores reduced the impact of drought on total cover by increasing the relative abundance of drought-resistant dominant species. Our results highlight that the negative effect of extreme drought on total plant cover could be alleviated by maintaining robust insect herbivore communities.

AB  - Milu (Pe`re David's deer, Elaphurus davidianus), once extinct in the wild, was one of the few indigenous large herbivores of the wetland ecosystem in China. The reintroduction of milu in northern China has just started and is expected to restore not only that species, but also the ecosystem. To acquire insights into the adaptive process of the milu population first rewilded in the northern habitat and provide knowledge for the on-going and future reintroduction attempts, we used DNA metabarcoding to analyze the diets and gut microbiota of those milu in the first year after releasing. The results showed strong seasonality in both diet and gut microbiota. Significant higher dietary diversity was detected in in autumn than summer and winter. Woody dietary components increased continuously from summer to winter. A significant correspondence was found between the dietary and microbial diversities. Enrichment of metabolic pathways involved in lipid and amino acid metabolism was identified in summer, and of those involved in carbohydrate and glycan metabolism was identified in winter. Pathways related to metabolism of certain amino acid were differently abundant in the breeding season. The study indicated the contribution of foraging and gut microbial seasonality to the overwintering, reproduction and environmental adaption of the reintroduced milu. The enrichment of opportunistic pathogen Treponema and lower microbial diversity indicated higher health risk in winter, and thus disease prevention measures were suggested. Pre- and post-release food evaluation and monitoring was recommended to ensure food sufficiency in the reintroductions.

AB  - Insectivorous predators, including birds and bats, play crucial roles in trophic cascades. However, previous research on these cascades has often relied on permanent predator exclosures, which prevent the isolation of specific effects of birds and bats, given their different activity patterns throughout the day. Moreover, limited knowledge exists regarding the variations in individual effects of these predators under different biotic and abiotic conditions, such as changes in elevation. To address these uncertainties, our study aimed to investigate the distinct effects of bats and birds on arthropod densities in foliage and herbivory damage in lowland and highland rainforests of Papua New Guinea (PNG). Predator exclosures were established for one month to exclude diurnal or nocturnal predators across 120 saplings (ca. 2.5-4 m tall) selected from two lowland and two highland forests (i.e., 30 saplings per study site) along the Mt. Wilhelm transect in PNG. Arthropods were collected and measured, and herbivory damage was analyzed at the end of the experiment. Birds significantly reduced arthropod densities by 30%, particularly in arthropods longer than 10 mm, regardless of elevation. Additionally, both birds and bats appeared to mitigate herbivory damage in highland forests, with protected saplings displaying up to 189% more herbivory. Our results support previous studies that have demonstrated the ability of insectivorous predators to reduce leaf damage through the control of arthropods. Furthermore, our approach highlights the importance and necessity of further research on the role of seasons and elevations in trophic cascades.

AB  - Wolves (Canis lupus) can exert top-down pressure and shape ecological communities through the predation of ungulates and beavers (Castor spp.). Therefore, understanding wolf foraging is critical to estimating their ecosystem-level effects. Specifically, if wolves are consumers that optimize tradeoffs between the cost and benefits of prey acquisition, changes in these factors may lead to prey-switching or negative-density dependent selection with potential consequences for community stability. For wolves, factors affecting cost and benefits include prey vulnerability, risk, reward, and availability, which can vary temporally. We described the wolf diet by the frequency of occurrence and percent biomass and characterized the diet using prey remains found in wolf scats on Isle Royale National Park, Michigan, USA, during May-October 2019 and 2020. We used logistic regression to estimate prey consumption over time. We predicted prey with temporal variation in cost (availability and/or vulnerability) such as adult moose (Alces alces), calf moose, and beaver (Castor canadensis) to vary in wolf diets. We analyzed 206 scats and identified 62% of remains as beaver, 26% as moose, and 12% as other species (birds, smaller mammals, and wolves). Adult moose were more likely to occur in wolf scats in May when moose are in poor condition following winter. The occurrence of moose calves peaked during June-mid-July following birth but before calf vulnerability declined as they matured. By contrast, beaver occurrence in wolf scat did not change over time, reflecting the importance of low-handling cost prey items for recently introduced lone or paired wolves. Our results demonstrate that the wolf diet is responsive to temporal changes in prey costs. Temporal fluctuation in diet may influence wolves' ecological role if prey respond to increased predation risk by altering foraging or breeding behavior.

AB  - Most European forests are used for timber production. Given the limited extent of unmanaged (and especially primary) forests, it is essential to include commercial forests in the conservation of forest biodiversity. In order to develop ecologically sustainable forest management practices, it is important to understand the management impacts on forest-dwelling organisms. Experiments allow testing the effects of alternative management strategies, and monitoring of multiple taxa informs us on the response range across forest-dwelling organisms. To provide a representative picture of the currently available information, metadata on 28 multi-taxa forest management experiments were collected from 14 European countries. We demonstrate the potential of compiling these experiments in a single network to upscale results from the local to continental level and indicate directions for future research. Among the different forest types, temperate deciduous beech and oak-dominated forests are the best represented in the multi-taxa management experiments. Of all the experimental treatments, innovative ways of traditional management techniques (e.g., gap cutting and thinning) and conservation-oriented interventions (e.g., microhabitat enrichment) provide the best opportunity for large-scale analyses. Regarding the organism groups, woody regeneration, herbs, fungi, beetles, bryophytes, birds and lichens offer the largest potential for addressing management-biodiversity relationships at the European level. We identified knowledge gaps regarding boreal, hemiboreal and broadleaved evergreen forests, the treatments of large herbivore exclusion, prescribed burning and forest floor or water manipulations, and the monitoring of soil-dwelling organisms and some vertebrate classes, e.g., amphibians, reptiles and mammals. To improve multi-site comparisons, design of future experiments should be fitted to the set-up of the ongoing projects and standardised biodiversity sampling is suggested. However, the network described here opens the way to learn lessons on the impact on forest biodiversity of different management techniques at the continental level, and thus, supports biodiversity conservation in managed forests.

While these 'conservation arks' provide refuge from many contemporary threats, they can also pose risks of genetic diversity loss and inbreeding depression, further exacerbating extinction risk. A pertinent example is the Kangaroo Island koala population in South Australia that originated from a few translocated founding individuals in the 1920s but now sustains a large population with a low prevalence of infectious disease. We investigated the extent and consequences of founder effects on genomic diversity, inbreeding, and adaptive potential in Kangaroo Island koalas by comparing them with mainland Australian populations using high-coverage whole genomes. Our findings support sharp, recent declines in effective population sizes (N e) in both mainland and Kangaroo Island populations. However, Kangaroo Island koalas had much lower individual and population-level diversity. Together with longer and more numerous runs of homozygosity and an increased proportion of homozygous genetic load, these results support the hypothesis that a severe bottleneck has contributed to inbreeding and maladaptation in Kangaroo Island koalas. While Kangaroo Island has the potential to conserve a viable population of koalas, we recommend genetic rescue to restore diversity and mitigate inbreeding depression in this isolated population. Our results emphasise the need for longitudinal genomic monitoring and genetic management to maintain long-term viability and resilience in potential conservation arks. Understanding the demographic history of such populations will help inform future conservation aimed at preventing genetic erosion and preserving biodiversity.

AB  - Although prominent examples exist of non-native species causing substantial ecological harm, many have neutral or positive effects, including filling surrogate roles once performed by extinct native organisms. We tested the ecological roles of two non-native mammals as seed dispersers or seed predators in Guahan, which, due to invasive brown tree snakes (Boiga irregularis), is devoid of native seed dispersers-birds and bats. We conducted feeding trials with captive rats (Rattus spp.), which are present but uncommon due to predation by snakes, and pigs (Sus scrofa), which are abundant. We examined if and how they interacted with common forest fruits. We then compared how any gut-passed or animal-handled seeds germinated compared to seeds left in whole fruit or depulped seeds. Rats and pigs interacted with most of the fruits and seeds (>80%) that they were fed. Of those, most seeds were destroyed-78% for rats and 90% for pigs, across both native and non-native plant species. Compared to seeds germinating within whole fruits, rats improved germination of the seeds that they handled without ingesting, while pigs diminished the germination of seeds that they handled. The small percentage of seeds (approximately 1.5% for rats and 5% for pigs) that survived gut passage germinated in higher proportions than those in whole fruits. Percentages of seed survival to germination are lower than found in similar studies with native avian frugivores. Our results indicate that pigs and rats have mixed effects on seeds, but are not suitable surrogates for native seed dispersers.

AB  - Simple Summary The populations of bison and moose, the largest wild ruminants in Poland, are growing every year. These animals return to Polish forests after many years of risk of extinction or, as in the case of European bison, are reintroduced step by step. Unfortunately, they are still rare and require close health surveillance and monitoring. One serious threat to their health and life is the bacterial parasite Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Moose and bison can also be sources of pathogenic bacteria for humans, which can be transferred through tick bites. In line with the World Health Organization (WHO) "OneHealth" program, indicating that animal health affects human health and vice versa, the following study examines the occurrence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum bacteria in European bison and Eurasian moose populations using molecular biology tools. Our results provide useful data regarding Anaplasma phagocytophilum that could be used in future strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of people and animals. Wild large ungulates, like European bison (Bison bonasus) and Eurasian moose (Alces alces), form an important part of the circulation of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, a Gram-negative, intracellular, tick-transmitted bacterium, in the natural environment. Bison and moose tissue samples were subjected to 16S rDNA, groEL and ankA partial gene marker amplification with specific primers using various variants of PCR. Out of 42 examined individuals, Anaplasma sp. were detected in 4/13 Eurasian moose (31%) and 7/29 European bison (24%). In addition, 12 groEL and 5 ankA partial gene positive samples were obtained from the examined animals. The phylogenetic analysis of the groEL partial gene classified samples from European bison to ecotype I, and samples from Eurasian moose to ecotype I and II; the analysis of the ankA partial gene assigned the samples to clusters I and IV. This study extends knowledge about A. phagocytophilum in wild large ungulates in Poland. This is the first report about the occurrence of Anaplasma sp. in one of the largest populations of free living European bison in the world. Our findings confirm that strains of A. phagocytophilum from Bison bonasus and Alces alces may constitute a natural reservoir of pathogenic HGA Anaplasma strains.

AB  - The Black-winged Myna (Acridotheres melanopterus) is an Endangered passerine endemic to the islands of Java and Bali, Indonesia. Illegal trapping to supply the cage-bird trade has led to its near-total extinction, with the global population estimated to number fewer than 100 individuals. We estimated the current range and population size of the species at Baluran National Park, which supports Java's last known population, and used species distribution modeling to evaluate potential suitability of currently unoccupied areas across the park to identify priorities for management intervention. We estimate that the Black-winged Myna population numbers 179 individuals (95% CI: 111-288; density: 14.3 +/- 3.5 individuals km(2)) and that its current range is 12.3 km'. Our model indicated that some 72 km(2) of the park (30% of total area) has potentially suitable habitat for the species, and we infer that the principal cause for the disparity between its current and potential range is trapping, compounded by savanna loss and degradation due to illegal domestic cattle grazing and the spread of invasive thorny acacia (Vachellia nilotica). The partial clearance of acacia in recent years appears to have assisted a modest population recovery by the myna. Its further population growth and range expansion in Baluran will depend on effective management of illegal poaching, further clearance of acacia, and easing domestic cattle grazing pressure on areas of savanna, particularly through engagement with communities living inside the park. Any actions that increase the size of the Black-winged Myna population are likely to benefit other threatened savanna-dependent wildlife in the park, notably banteng (Bos javanicus) and Green Peafowl (Pavo muticus). While our models and recommendations may be applicable to other protected areas in Java, and indeed other threatened myna species, trapping and habitat change may have site-specific dimensions, especially outside of protected areas, and thus demand local bespoke solutions.

AB  - Understanding how habitat, landscape context, and human disturbance influence local species-specific deer density provides evidence informing strategic management of increasing deer populations. Across an extensive (187 km(2)) heterogeneous forest-mosaic landscape in eastern England, spatially explicit density surface models of roe deer Capreolus capreolus and introduced muntjac Muntiacus reevesi were calibrated by thermal imaging distance sampling (recording 1590 and 400 muntjac and roe deer groups, respectively, on 567 km of driven transects). Models related deer density to local habitat composition, recreational intensity, and deer density (roe deer models controlled for muntjac density and vice versa) at a local grain across 1162 composite transect segments, incorporating geographical coordinates accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Abundance of both species was lower in localities with more grasslands (inter-quartile, IQ, effect size: roe -2.9 deer/km(2); muntjac -2.9 deer/km(2)). Roe abundance (mean = 7 deer/km(2), SD = 6) was greater in localities with more young stands (IQ effect size, + 1.3 deer/km(2)) and lower at localities with more recreationists (-1.1 deer/km(2)). Muntjac density (mean = 21 deer/km(2), SD = 10) was greater in localities with more recreationists (+ 2.4 deer/km(2)), with more mature (>= 46 years) stands (+ 1.5 deer/km(2)), or calcareous soil (+ 7.1 deer/km(2)). Comparison of models incorporating candidate variables and models comprising geographical coordinates only shows candidate variables to be weak predictors of deer densities. Adapting forest management to manipulate habitat and recreational access may influence local deer densities, but only subtly: effect sizes are not sufficient to mitigate deer impacts through planting vulnerable tree crops in areas avoided by deer. Effective culling remains the most viable management option.

AB  - Invasive species pose significant threats to native ecosystems and species, especially on islands with high rates of endemism and susceptibility. The introduction of the sika deer (Cervus nippon) to South Korea has negatively impacted its wild ecosystems and native species, including those on Jeju Island. However, there is limited knowledge of sika deer ecology to inform effective species management and policy decisions. To bridge this knowledge gap, we examined the group dynamics, with a focus on age-sex class structure, group size, and habitat utilization variation of sika deer on Jeju Island, South Korea, by analyzing three years of camera trap data. Our findings illuminate a slightly skewed sex ratio toward females, with adults and yearlings comprising the dominant age class. The annual relative abundance of each age class showed a single activity peak in May for both yearlings and adults, whereas a peak was observed in August for juveniles. Group sizes ranged from to 1-7 individuals, with a mean group size of 3.72 f 1.25 individuals. Habitat utilization patterns differed by age class, with juvenile abundance escalating with increasing distance from the forest edge, whereas adult females were active close to human settlements. This study highlights the critical importance of controlling the adult female population as a direct strategy for mitigating conflicts arising from sika deer habitat utilization. By addressing the unique behavior and habitat preferences of sika deer, our findings provide valuable insights for informed decision-making, effective species management, and preservation of native ecosystems, particularly on Jeju Island.

AB  - Birds play key roles in forest dynamics, favoring the resilience of forests to cattle ranching. Generalist species may benefit from changes in the vegetation structure caused by cattle grazing while specialist species are usually negatively affected. Therefore, studying changes in taxonomic and functional bird diversity can provide valuable information in order to propose the sustainable cattle management practices. Here, we study the influence of different cattle management practices (Cattle Exclusion: FCE; Continuous grazing: FCG; Rotational grazing: FRG; Seasonal grazing: FSG) on the understory vegetation structure, and the bird taxonomic and functional diversity in humid Chaco forests of Argentina. Forests under grazing had an open (FCG) or semi-open (FRG and FSG) understory, whereas FCE presented a closed understory with higher plant richness. Generalized linear models revealed a decrease in bird richness and abundance under most cattle management practices compared to FCE. However, FRG was most similar to FCE in terms of vegetation structure and showed no differences in bird richness. FCE presented the lowest values of functional diversity while FCG and FRG showed the highest values. A fourth-corner analysis showed that FCE was associated with insectivorous species which forage and nest in the shrub layer, reflecting a possible loss of ecosystem services in forests with cattle grazing. We propose FRG as the most appropriate cattle management option and the least detrimental to bird assemblages. However, maintaining protected areas that exclude cattle ranching activities will be key to strike a balance between the conservation of most specialist species and beef production.Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.
   Las aves desempenan un rol clave en la dinamica de bosques, favoreciendo la resiliencia de los bosques al pastoreo del ganado vacuno. Las especies generalistas pueden beneficiarse de los cambios en la estructura de la vegetacion causados por el pastoreo del ganado, mientras que las especies especialistas suelen verse afectadas negativamente. En este sentido, estudiar los cambios en la diversidad taxonomica y funcional de las aves puede proporcionar informacion valiosa para proponer practicas de manejo ganadero sustentables. Aqui, estudiamos la influencia de diferentes practicas de manejo ganadero (Exclusion de ganado: FCE; Pastoreo continuo: FCG; Pastoreo rotacional: FRG; Pastoreo estacional: FSG) sobre la estructura de la vegetacion del sotobosque y la diversidad taxonomica y funcional de las aves en los bosques humedos del Chaco de Argentina. Los bosques bajo pastoreo tuvieron un sotobosque abierto (FCG) o semiabierto (FRG y FSG), mientras que los FCE presentaron un sotobosque cerrado con mayor riqueza de la vegetacion. Los modelos lineales generalizados revelaron una disminucion en la riqueza y abundancia de aves bajo la mayoria de las practicas de manejo ganadero en comparacion con FCE. Sin embargo, FRG fue mas similar a FCE en terminos de la estructura de la vegetacion y no mostro diferencias en la riqueza de aves. FCE presento los valores mas bajos de diversidad funcional mientras que FCG y FRG mostraron los valores mas altos. El fourth corner analisis mostro que el FCE estaba asociado con especies insectivoras que se alimentan y anidan en el estrato arbustivo, lo que refleja una posible perdida de servicios ecosistemicos en bosques con pastoreo de ganado. Proponemos el FRG como la opcion de manejo ganadero mas adecuada y la menos perjudicial para la comunidad de aves. Sin embargo, mantener areas protegidas que excluyan las actividades ganaderas sera clave para lograr un equilibrio entre la conservacion de la mayoria de las especies especializadas y la produccion de carne vacuna.

AB  - Islands host high numbers of endemic species, and the latter are especially exposed to human-driven habitat alteration because their population size is constrained by the limited space and resources found in insular systems. Extreme events linked with climate change and direct anthropogenic stressors may synergistically affect endemic species, and even push them to the brink of extinction. Bats include many insular endemics whose life traits make them excellent candidates to test the effects of both climate-change driven events and direct human disturbance. The Mediterranean island of Sardinia is home to the endemic long-eared bat Plecotus sardus. Within the island, this recently described species is restricted to a limited range where suitable habitat is present. This makes the species extremely vulnerable to human action. Here we use Plecotus sardus as a model to assess the response of insular endemic bats to climate change and human disturbance, exploring demographic trends across two decades. Overall, roost count data for all known reproductive sites showed a steep (-63.4% between 2003 and 2020) population decline, so that the current estimated population size is only 36.5% of that observed in 2003. Colony growth rates are strongly affected by recurring wildfires around reproductive sites, summer precipitation and temperature extremes, pointing to climate change as a primary threat to the species along with direct human interference. Such anthropogenic pressures may therefore rapidly expose island endemic bats to a high extinction risk. Based on our analysis, Plecotus sardus is among the most threatened mammals, and likely the rarest bat species, in Europe. Thus, we urge that (1) similar assessments are conducted on other insular endemic bats in Mediterranean Europe, (2) IUCN Redlist categories are revised according to new analyses, and (3) recovery action plans are immediately developed and implemented to revert the current population trends.

AB  - The wild boar (Sus scrofa) was introduced to Patagonia in the early 20th century through multiple independent events in Junin de los Andes, the Huemul Peninsula, and Victoria Island (Neuquen Province). Despite uncertainties surrounding their origin, questions persist regarding the extent of hybridization between these populations and domestic or feral pigs. This study presents (i) an analysis of the genetic variability and phylogenetic origin of the sub-Andean population (Neuqu & eacute;n province) of wild pigs from Patagonia using the molecular marker control region and (ii) a population genotyping with the MC1R marker to identify pure wild boar or domestic alleles in the zone. The results confirm the Iberian origin of the Patagonian wild pigs population and suggest potential genetic erosion due to genetic drift, as evidenced by low diversity values (Hd = 0.7950 +/- 0.0510 and pi = 0.0036 +/- 0.0005) compared with previous studies from Argentina and Europe. Moreover, MC1R genotyping reveals the presence of hybrids in the region (allelic frequencies E+ = 0.5, E-PD2 = 0.250, E-D1e = 0.250), with a pure core observed on Isla Victoria, Nahuel Huapi National Park (allelic frequency E+ = 1). These findings are significant as hybrids contribute to the invasive potential of the species, a concern particularly pertinent in areas with protected habitats. Additionally, the identification of a pure wild boar population on Isla Victoria suggests its potential importance as one of the few remaining pure populations in the country.

AB  - ContextRepeated surveys to investigate mammalian assemblages at the landscape level are crucial to understanding how natural ecosystems function and regulate over time.ObjectivesWe assessed mammalian species richness and occupancy changes across selected protected areas (PAs) in northern KwaZulu-Natal in the Maputaland Conservation Unit, South Africa.MethodsWe collected data using 366 camera traps during 2013-2014 and 2022-2023, consisting of 183 camera trap sites covering four PAs (iSimangaliso Wetland Park, incorporating Eastern Shores, Western Shores, and False Bay PAs, and Tembe Elephant Park) that varied in size, habitat diversity and disturbance levels. Our study assessed whether changes in mammalian species richness and occupancy occur across protected areas in northern KwaZulu-Natal, relative to biotic drivers (habitat and path type) in protected areas over two independent survey cycles using a multi-species occupancy model. We applied the Royle-Nichols multi-session multi-species hierarchical model to estimate species richness and occupancy dynamics of 39 mammalian species for different PAs while accounting for imperfect detection.ResultsSpecies richness increased with PA size across both camera trap cycles. Two PAs (False Bay and Western Shores) experienced major declines in estimated species richness compared with the previous study. Mammalian community richness remained relatively stable. Notable shifts in mammal occupancy for eight species and detection for ten species over two survey periods were found, reflecting changes in habitat composition and potential pressures from poaching and human activities. Eight mammalian species showed marked increases in detection, while others, hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) and serval (Leptailurus serval), experienced declines. Occupancy pattern shifts were present, with some species increasing in occupancy, particularly in habitats such as grasslands and forests, while cane rats (Thryonomys swinderianus) and white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum) showed significant declines.ConclusionsOur results suggest that habitat composition changes, particularly the expansion or reduction of specific habitats (e.g., grasslands, forests), influenced species occupancy trends, with more generalist species adapting to broader habitat types and specialist species experiencing occupancy reductions based on habitat specificity. Additionally, poaching was widespread in sections near the Western Shores fence line. Management should intensify antipoaching resources in hotspot areas (security and ranger patrols) to reduce illegal hunting within the reserve. Our multi-species, multi-season models revealed the resilience and stability of terrestrial mammals in PAs within the Maputaland Conservation Unit, KwaZulu-Natal. Through a systematic survey approach, we emphasise the value of long-term monitoring for tracking large-scale population trends in this ecologically and economically significant region.

AB  - A shifting focus in forest management from timber production to resilience and multifunctionality in the face of changing disturbance regimes might entail altering the species composition of forests. Although the conifers Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and silver fir (Abies alba) currently comprise only a small proportion of Central European forests, the prospect of widespread planting of these species as a climate adaptation measure is currently widely debated by forest managers. To inform this debate, objective assessments of the multifunctional value of these species are required. Here, we introduce Pareto frontiers to objectively assess the value of tree species under competing objectives and considering an uncertain future. Using these frontiers, we explore trade-offs between financial performance and biodiversity aspects of German tree species portfolios with and without these currently rare conifers. We compare several potential biodiversity indicators (related to herbivores, saproxylic beetles, and deadwood decomposition rates) that can be derived from standard forest inventory data. Our results indicate that optimizing the biodiversity indicators generates gradual decreases in financial performance at first, but after an inflection point soil rent declines sharply. Portfolios excluding Douglas fir and silver fir achieved comparable biodiversity levels, but much weaker financial performance, than portfolios that included these conifers. Our novel approach of generating Pareto frontiers that integrate uncertainty can offer useful insights into ecosystem services trade-offs in contexts where risk is unequally distributed across management alternatives.

AB  - The South American fauna has endured challenges such as illegal hunting, cattle expansion, climate change, and landscape fragmentation. Despite ongoing conservation efforts that aim to address these issues, genetic diversity remains overlooked. We genotyped 126 Lama guanicoe individuals from an area of 2 million km(2) in Patagonia and Cuyo using the 60K SNPs Axiom-Camelids, and we assessed population viability through genetic diversity, inbreeding, and population size. We then explored population connectivities through network analyses, genetic differentiation, and Bayesian approaches. Our findings reveal six genetic clusters: Cuyo, Somuncura, North Patagonia, Central Patagonia, South Patagonia, and Tierra del Fuego Island (TDFI). Cuyo and TDFI guanacos differed from others due to isolation-by-distance and geographical barriers, respectively. Cuyo exhibited the highest degree of allele conservation, but TDFI faced heightened vulnerability due to isolation and increased homozygosity. Sharp bottlenecks in Cuyo and North Patagonia coincided with the expansion of sheep farming, while bottlenecks in the other populations occurred during the Little Ice Age. North Patagonia acted as a probable contact zone, facilitating mixing of the Cuyo, Somuncura, and Central Patagonia populations. The Central and South Patagonian populations presented the highest gene flow. Thus, genomic advances help to define distinct conservation units (genetic stocks) to guide management practices and decisions.

AB  - The Tasmanian emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae diemenensis) persisted alongside Aboriginal people for similar to 40,000 years, for the last similar to 14,000 years of which Tasmania was a large, continental island. This population of emus was extirpated soon after European colonization in the 19th century. Is hunting by people sufficient to explain the rapid demise of the emu or should we look to a synergy of pressures? Could wild emus be reintroduced to Tasmania? We investigated the distribution, hunting, and extinction of emus in Tasmania, before and after colonization, using population simulations, species distribution modelling, and land use analysis. We also evaluated the potential for rewilding with emus in present Tasmanian landscapes. The Tasmanian emu was a generalist with respect to vegetation and was widespread in the lowlands of eastern Tasmania. Prior to colonization, the maximum sustainable yield of adult emus was low, less than one per person per year. Following colonization, hunting rates quickly increased to a level that can account for rapid extinction. Large parts of Tasmania have both habitat and land uses suitable for an introduction of Australian mainland emus (D. n. novaehollandiae). This putative reintroduction of emus to Tasmania could reinstate several ecological and cultural roles but successful rewilding would require support from the wider community. We recommend field trial experiments, with methodologies co-designed by local community members.

AB  - Invasive rodents are among the world's most damaging invasive species linked to declines and extinctions of many vertebrate and invertebrate species, especially in island ecosystems. However, despite a mainly herbivorous diet, their impacts on plant communities are less well known, with few studies in Australian ecosystems. We studied the potential impacts of high-density populations of invasive black rats (Rattus rattus) on the restoration of an endangered ecological community of sub-tropical rainforest on two small islands in southeastern Australia. We used two experiments to investigate rat impacts on two woody rainforest species, Hibiscus heterophyllus and Acacia maidenii, that are frequently used for successional planting in restoration. We hypothesised that, as black rats generally obtain a large amount of their diet from plants, they would rapidly damage Hibiscus and Acacia seedlings and consume Hibiscus seeds. We found that using cages to exclude black rats for 11-14 days had significant effects on herbivory of Hibiscus seedlings but not for Acacia seedlings. Hibiscus seedlings with no exclusion cage lost an average of 17% more leaves (1.83 of initial average 10.6 leaves per plant) when compared to caged seedlings. We also found that excluding rats reduced the number of Hibiscus seedlings damaged, although 50% of the damage was suspected to be caused by insects. Although only 4.5% of total Hibiscus seeds were removed during the 3-day experimental period, the night-time removal rate (mostly attributed to black rats) was 10 times more than that of other diurnal foragers. This rate of seed removal by black rats has the potential to contribute to poor restoration in rainforest but was lower than black rat consumption of seeds in other systems. We conclude that, in our system, black rats appear to have minimal potential impacts on these rainforest species, despite high rat densities, confirming the successful use of these species in restoration. However, being novel to the system, the additive effects of rats on seed loss over time warrant further investigation.

AB  - Mast seeding drives large-scale population fluctuations in forest-dwelling animals, including the wild boar Sus scrofa. Many studies of the masting effects on population dynamics of wild boars have been conducted in cool- and warm-temperate forests; however, studies on wild boar populations inhabiting subtropical forests, which have more diverse plant resources than temperate forests, are limited. The mast seeding effects of Castanopsis sieboldii on the reproductive schedule and population fluctuations of wild boars inhabiting the subtropical climate zone of the Ryukyu Islands (Japan) were investigated using 14 years of camera trap data. The reproductive schedule, estimated based on the emergence of piglets, varied in response to masting. The piglet emergence during the January-February period was higher in the years after masting than in the years that followed non-masting events, evidencing that the reproductive season started earlier and lasted longer in the years after masting. The Bayesian state-space model incorporating direct density-dependence and masting effects revealed that the relative population size was negatively affected by the population size of the previous year and positively affected by the previous year's occurrence of masting. These observations indicate that masting is a critical factor driving population dynamics of wild boars living in subtropical forests and also highlight the importance of mast seeding effects on population fluctuations of wild boars when developing management plans for these animals.

AB  - The Espiritu Santo Island (ESI) has the highest elasmobranch richness among the Gulf of California islands, exemplifying its importance for conservation. In the present study, we assessed the temporal variation of the batoid assemblages captured in the southern ESI. Using the monthly artisanal fishing fleet catch data between 2013 and 2015, we applied three methods to evaluate changes in diversity: descriptive (i.e., richness, dominance, evenness, and Shannon-Wiener index), taxonomic diversity, and functional diversity. Four orders, ten families, ten genera, and 15 species were identified. Mobula munkiana, Hypanus dipterurus, Narcine entemedor, and Rhinoptera steindachneri were the most numerically abundant (dominant) during the study period. The Biological Values Index of these species indicated temporary changes mainly attributable to sea surface temperature. Diversity and average taxonomic distinctiveness values were high, indicating stability in the batoids assemblage assessed. Further, we identified nine functional groups classified mainly into two life history types, benthic and pelagic. The former group was characterized as having small- to medium-sized species and circular and oval body shape with preferences to remain buried or on sea bottom. The second group was formed by large-body size species and rhomboid body shape with high motility in the water column and with migrations. The ESI community of batoids has a stable taxonomic structure over time, whose functional groups have adapted to the ESI environmental conditions and available resources. This study confirms and highlights the importance of ESI as a critical site for these batoid species within the Gulf of California and thus their conservation.

AB  - 1. Reintroduction projects, which are an important tool in threatened species conservation, are becoming more complex, often involving the translocation of multiple species. Ecological theory predicts that the sequence and timing of reintroductions will play an important role in their success or failure. Following the removal of sheep, goats and feral cats, the Western Australian government is sequentially reintroducing 13 native fauna species to restore the globally important natural and cultural values of Dirk Hartog Island (DHI).
   2. We use ensembles of ecosystem models to compare 23 alternative reintroduction strategies on DHI, in Western Australia. The reintroduction strategies differ in the order, timing and location of releases on the island. Expert elicitation informed the model structure, allowing for use of different presumed species interaction networks which explicitly incorporated uncertainty in ecosystem dynamics.
   3. Our model ensembles predict that almost all of the species (similar to 12.5 of 13, on average) will successfully establish in the ecosystem studied, regardless of which reintroduction strategy is undertaken. The project can therefore proceed with greater confidence and flexibility regarding the reintroduction strategy. However, the identity of the at-risk species varies between strategies, and depends on the structure of the species interaction network, which is quite uncertain. The model ensembles also offer insights into why some species fail to establish on DHI, predicting that most unsuccessful reintroductions will be the result of competitive interactions with extant species.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our model ensembles allow for the comparison of outcomes between reintroduction strategies and between different species interaction networks. This framework allows for inclusion of high uncertainty in dynamics. Finally, an ensemble modelling approach also creates a foundation for formal adaptive management as reintroduction projects proceed.

AB  - North American elk Cervus canadensis inhabited portions of the eastern United States until extirpation in the mid-1800s. From 2000 to 2008, 201 elk were reintroduced to the North Cumberland Wildlife Management Area (NCWMA), Tennessee. The stocking source was Elk Island National Park, Alberta Canada where there are two distinct genetic populations isolated from the north and south. This genetic structure has largely persisted in the population after translocation. Food habits were evaluated in the early stages of restoration, but the population has had approximately 20 years to adapt to the landscape, and current food habits are unknown. To assess diet composition using DNA metabarcoding, we collected fecal pellets of elk from 65 openings within the 79 318 ha NCWMA weekly from February to April of 2019. We targeted the ITS2 region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA to amplify vegetation sequences found in the internal portion of the elk feces. DNA metabarcoding of feces was linked to results from an accompanying elk population genetics study to investigate food habits between sexes from the two different genetic groups. The majority (80.298%) of sequences matched plants from 21 genera. The top genera (> 5.000%) represented were Vaccinium (15.216%), Festuca (8.446%), Rosa (6.358%), Robinia (5.793%), and Eleagnus (5.186%). Elk heavily used woody plants before and after spring green-up (> 50% of diet). However, the quantity of forbs in their diet more than doubled after emergence in the spring. The sex-genetic groups consumed similar vegetation in approximately proportionate amounts. Diversity analyses revealed a significant difference in plant genera sequence detection between males from the two genetic groups, although this finding is likely explained by limited sample size. NCWMA elk used a variety of forage in the winter and DNA metabarcoding analysis allows for a comprehensive analysis of food habits useful for monitoring how elk respond dietarily to habitat management.

AB  - Biological invasions have major impacts on a variety of ecosystems and threaten native biodiversity. Earthworms have been absent from northern parts of North America since the last ice age, but non-native earthworms were recently introduced there and are now being spread by human activities. While past work has shown that plant communities in earthworm-invaded areas change towards a lower diversity mainly dominated by grasses, the underlying mechanisms related to changes in the biotic interactions of the plants are not well understood. Here, we used a trait-based approach to study the effect of earthworms on interspecific plant competition and aboveground herbivory. We conducted a microcosm experiment in a growth chamber with a full-factorial design using three plant species native to northern North American deciduous forests, Poa palustris (grass), Symphyotrichum laeve (herb) and Vicia americana (legume), either growing in monoculture or in a mixture of three. These plant community treatments were crossed with earthworm (presence or absence) and herbivore (presence or absence) treatments. Eight out of the fourteen above- and belowground plant functional traits studied were significantly affected by earthworms, either by a general effect or in interaction with plant species identity, plant diversity level and/or herbivore presence. Earthworms increased the aboveground productivity and the number of inflorescences of the grass P. palustris. Further, earthworms and herbivores together affected root tissue density of P. palustris and the specific leaf area of V. americana. In this study, earthworm presence gave a competitive advantage to the grass species P. palustris by inducing changes in plant functional traits. Our results suggest that invasive earthworms can alter competitive and multitrophic interactions of plants, shedding light on some of the mechanisms behind invasive earthworm-induced plant community changes in northern North America forests.

AB  - IntroductionField experiments of gap-based harvest systems in temperate northern hardwood forests have provided inconsistent support for the theory that such regeneration approaches can improve regeneration success among increasingly underrepresented tree species intermediate in shade tolerance. We established a field experiment in Wisconsin, USA testing the long-term response of tree regeneration to group selection harvesting that created small (50 m(2)-D:H 0.32), medium (200 m(2)-D:H 0.64) and large (380 m(2)-D:H 0.88) gaps. Materials and methodsLight levels were modeled to test the assumption of resource heterogeneity within and across these gap sizes. Spatial statistics were used to assess whether the point patterns of saplings of several midtolerant tree species (Betula alleghaniensis, Carya cordiformis, Fraxinus spp.) mapped in harvest gaps provided evidence for partitioning across resource gradients 9 years post-harvest. Finally, we measured occurrence and height of all saplings within the harvest gaps to test the effects of gap size and deer exclusion fencing on the density and total height of shade-tolerant and midtolerant tree regeneration. Results and discussionLight levels progressively increased with gap size, varied by position within gaps, and provided significant evidence of resource heterogeneity. The complex light gradients formed both within and across the three gap sizes may partially explain the statistically significant clustering of Fraxinus spp. saplings in gap centers and north and east into the forested edge of medium and large gaps, C. cordiformis on the west sides of forested transitions surrounding large gaps, and B. alleghaniensis in the centers of large gaps. Densities of tolerant and midtolerant saplings were similar in medium and large gaps after nine growing seasons, though tolerant saplings averaged two meters taller across all three gap sizes. Our results show that gap-based silvicultural systems can create resource gradients that are sufficient to regenerate mixtures of species with high to intermediate tolerance of shade. However, prescriptions beyond harvesting and deer exclusion fencing may be necessary for the recruitment of midtolerant species to canopy positions.

AB  - We developed simple practical methods to estimate deer appearance frequency and damage risk for cedar saplings protected by tree shelters, by using field signs such as browsed understory plants, debarked trees, and animal trails. The appearance frequency of the sika deer was recorded using camera traps at 29 clear-logged and young plantation sites in the Shikoku Island of western Japan. Field signs such as fecal pellets, footprints, animal trails, and browsed plants were recorded in three transects that were 2 m x 50 m each, located at the margins of the sites. Cubic regression analysis showed that the frequency of deer appearance could be predicted from the number of browsed plant species categorized into three ranks, that is, 0, 1, and >= 2 species. To use this method, plant species are not required for identification, as the user can simply judge whether browsed plants found in 5-m sections are all the same species or not. The damage of sheltered cedar saplings was assessed at 36 sites in the Kyushu and Shikoku Islands of western Japan, and surveys of deer field signs were also conducted. The proportion of heavily damaged saplings could be determined from the indices of binary summarized data of bark stripping and animal trails using a logistic regression model. The indices derived from the field signs will help forest managers to detect relatively low frequency of deer appearances and high risk of cedar sapling damage at a sheltered plantation in the western Japan.

AB  - Carnivores have key ecological roles in structuring and regulating ecosystems through their impacts on prey populations. When apex- and meso-predators co-occur in ecosystems, there is the potential for complex interspecific interactions and trophic dynamics that can affect the composition and functioning of ecological communities. Investigating the diet of sympatric carnivores can allow us to better understand their ecological roles (e.g. potential suppression of herbivores) or impacts (e.g. predation of threatened species). Australia's alpine region provides an ideal system in which to explore spatial and temporal variation in predator and prey interactions, using the dingo (Canis dingo) and invasive red fox (Vulpes vulpes) diet. We examined the diet of dingoes and foxes across three different mountains and seasons in Victoria's alpine region, using macroscopic scat analysis. There was little diet overlap between the two carnivores, with foxes having a broader diet than dingoes. Dingoes primarily consumed larger mammal species, including invasive sambar deer (Cervus unicolor, 44%), and the native common wombat (Vombatus ursinus, 34%), whereas foxes typically consumed smaller mammals, including the native bush rat (Rattus fuscipes, 55%), and the invasive European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus, 15%). Dingoes consumed more than thirty times the volume of large invasive mammals (predominantly sambar deer) than did foxes. Foxes consumed close to 15 times as many critical weight range individuals per scat than dingoes. Only one threatened critical weight range mammal species was identified within scats, the broad-toothed rat (Mastacomys fuscus), found within five fox scats. Our results suggest that the introduction of novel prey may alter predator-predator interactions by causing a reduction in the dietary overlap. Therefore, in the context of integrated wildlife management and biodiversity conservation, any control of novel, invasive prey populations needs to consider possible flow on effects to apex- and meso-predator diets and potential secondary impacts on native prey.

AB  - We provide a case study of how we position our rewilding project in central Chile in order to find scientific and social support and build alliances, collaborations, and consensus. Our core vision focuses on reintroducing guanacos (Lama guanicoe) to central Chile in order to provide natural restoration and ecosystem processes in espinal woodlands dominated by the native tree Vachellia [Acacia] caven. We envision a scenario of "social-ecological rewilding" with widespread guanaco browsing in woodlands and guanaco migration across the region, coexisting with multiple human uses of the landscape. Guanacos would ideally be managed by regional collectives who could benefit from guanaco tourism, sustainable harvest of their fiber (wool), and regulated hunting. Our wider vision for reintroductions and integrated conservation management extends to a set of other species that may have coexisted with guanacos and V. caven at various points in the past, but more research is necessary to establish and gain support for evidence-based baselines. Our strategy is to inspire actors with greater resources (land, money, influence) to share our vision and implement it, in collaboration with the NGO that we have formed to support our projects. Over ten years, circulating alternate interpretations and a novel imaginary of how central Chile was in the past and could be in the future, along with developing and testing scientific hypotheses, has moved our vision from an idea shared by two people to one that a wide variety of actors publicly embrace.

AB  - Herbivorous fish can mediate spatial competition between algae and corals, which is crucial for coral ecosystems. However, in areas with limited coral coverage like the Mexican tropical Pacific (MTP), this dynamic is not fully understood. This study, using a functional trait approach and ordination analysis, explores whether herbivorous reef fish assemblage influences the benthic habitat components or if physicochemical factors define the habitat variability in the MTP's Cleofas and Marietas insular systems. We analyzed if this relationship persisted across systems and over time, and identified species traits tied to habitat variability. Island comparison analyses between Cleofas and Marietas reveal that both herbivorous reef fish and physicochemical variables shape the habitat. Cleofas had larger mobile herbivorous fish that formed groups related mostly to macroalgae cover. In contrast, temporal analysis of Marietas shows that the habitat is primarily shaped by physicochemical variables with herbivorous fish being mainly small farmer species related to branching corals. Notably, these closely situated insular systems present varied ecosystem mediators, influenced by diverse drivers including fish traits and environmental factors. This study underscores the potential of employing a framework of ecological species traits combined with ordination methods to unravel the distinct site dynamics that contribute to the persistence of coral ecosystems within the MTP.

AB  - Soil erosion caused by unsustainable grazing is a major driver of grassland ecosystem degradation in many semi-arid hilly areas in China. Thus, grazing exclusion is considered as an effective method for solving this issue in such areas. However, some ecological and economic problems, such as slow grassland rejuvenation and limited economic conditions, have become obstacles for the sustainable utilization of grassland ecosystem. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the conflict between grassland use and soil conservation may be balanced by a reasonable grazing intensity. In this study, a two-year grazing fence experiment with five grazing intensity gradients was conducted in a typical grassland of the Loess Plateau in China to evaluate the responses of vegetation characteristics and soil and water losses to grazing intensity. The five grazing intensity gradients were 2.2, 3.0, 4.2, 6.7, and 16.7 goats/hm2, which were represented by G1-G5, respectively, and no grazing was used as control. The results showed that a reasonable grazing intensity was conducive to the sustainable utilization of grassland resources. Vegetation biomass under G1-G4 grazing intensity significantly increased by 51.9%, 42.1%, 36.9%, and 36.7%, respectively, compared with control. In addition, vegetation coverage increased by 19.6% under G1 grazing intensity. Species diversity showed a single peak trend with increasing grazing intensity. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index under G1-G4 grazing intensities significantly increased by 22.8%, 22.5%, 13.3%, and 8.3%, respectively, compared with control. Furthermore, grazing increased the risk of soil erosion. Compared with control, runoff yields under G1-G5 grazing intensities increased by 1.4, 2.6, 2.8, 4.3, and 3.9 times, respectively, and sediment yields under G1-G5 grazing intensities were 3.0, 13.0, 20.8, 34.3, and 37.7 times greater, respectively, than those under control. This result was mainly attributed to a visible decrease in litter biomass after grazing, which decreased by 50.5%, 72.6%, 79.0%, 80.0%, and 76.9%, respectively, under G1-G5 grazing intensities. By weighing the grassland productivity and soil conservation function, we found that both two aims were achieved at a low grazing intensity of less than 3.5 goats/hm2. Therefore, it is recommended that grassland should be moderately utilized with grazing intensity below 3.5 goats/hm2 in semi-arid hilly areas to achieve the dual goals of ecological and economic benefits. The results provide a scientific basis for grassland utilization and health management in semi-arid hilly areas from the perspective of determining reasonable grazing intensity to maintain both grassland production and soil conservation functions.

AB  - IntroductionTrophic cascades can produce important effects on a community where some species may have strong effects on other parts of the community up, down the food chain, or both. Top predators are often controlled from the bottom-up by the abundance of their prey base while prey animals are often controlled from the top-down. Studies of trophic interactions in the tropics suggest that the trophic chains are longer because of the high productivity; and because of the high diversity there is abundant intraguild redundancy which results in weak interactions.MethodsWe studied the effect of bottom-up forces affecting the population of green Anaconda (Eunectes murinus) in the Venezuelan llanos; looking at net primary productivity, precipitation, and the abundance of an important prey item, Capybara (Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris).ResultsOur data show a strong interaction of these variables on the percentage of Anacondas that reproduce in a given year (here forth breeding ratio). In particular Capybara abundance has a strong effect. Capybara abundance itself is also under strong bottom-up influence determined by precipitation and Net Primary Productivity.DiscussionThese strong interactions are not what is expected from a tropical ecosystem. We also found an unexpected strong influence of precipitation and primary productivity on Anaconda breeding ratio not related to the abundance of Capybara, likely affecting abundance of other prey or affecting non-trophic variables. This later evidence supports the notion that there is redundancy in tropical food chains and, strong as the effect of Capybara abundance might be, Anacondas do not entirely rely on them.

AB  - IntroductionThe increasing number of dams approaching obsolescence drives a need for knowledge about riparian restoration associated with dam removal. Restoring woody vegetation on exposed reservoir beds following dam removal is essential to stabilizing sediment, reconnecting riverine and terrestrial systems, and providing future sources of shade, nutrients, and wood. Revegetation after dam removal on many rivers can be challenging due to rapidly drying sediment, low sediment nutrient content, and heavy ungulate browse pressure. Revegetation in Elwha River restoration, the largest dam removal to date, used large woody debris (LWD) to mitigate moisture and nutrient limitation but ungulate browsing has constrained woody plant growth in many coarse sediment deposits. We evaluated potential for LWD to reduce ungulate browsing following Elwha dam removal.MethodsWe studied LWD mitigation of browsing in the largest former reservoir and a comparable valley upriver with a natural floodplain. We measured browse intensity in randomly located plots stratified by four levels of LWD extent, from no LWD to complete LWD enclosure.ResultsLWD reduced browse intensity four-fold in the former reservoir, but only in plots fully surrounded by LWD. Partial LWD enclosure provided little browse reduction. We obtained similar results in the upriver valley, where browse intensity was somewhat lower except within wood clusters. Wood-mediated browse reduction was slightly greater in the former reservoir than in the upriver valley. Protection from browse was greatest for plant species preferred by ungulates.DiscussionThese results suggest forest restoration after dam removal can be expedited by surrounding young trees with large logs. Planting within LWD clusters or placing LWD clusters in restoration sites can facilitate establishment of forest islands in strategic locations. These forest islands can support dispersal of seeds and marine derived nutrients, reconnect established forest to the river, and potentially advance restoration by decades.

AB  - Recommendations to use deer-excluding fencing as a method to reduce blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis Say) in residential settings are based primarily upon studies excluding deer from large areas (>= 3.5 hectares), often in undeveloped woodland settings. Evidence is still needed on the efficacy of deer-excluding fences for tick management at smaller suburban residential properties common to tick-endemic areas of the northeastern United States. We measured I. scapularis abundance at 16 fenced and 16 unfenced properties in Fairfield County, Connecticut, Westchester County, New York, and Washington County, Rhode Island. Overall, adult and nymphal I. scapularis encounter rates (ticks per sampling meter) were slightly higher on unfenced properties compared to within fenced properties, but differences were not significant (P > 0.05). Among fenced properties alone, tick encounter rates were significantly higher in areas immediately outside of fences compared with inside of fences for nymphs (P = 0.005), but not for adults (P > 0.05). Prevalence of tick pathogen infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia miyamotoi, Babesia microti, Babesia odocoilei, or Anaplasma phagocytophilum did not differ significantly between fenced and unfenced properties (P > 0.05). Irrespective of fencing, adult tick abundance was higher at properties with stonewalls, dense herbaceous ecotone vegetation, and an absence of bird feeders. Nymphal tick encounter rates were associated with stonewalls, an absence of bird feeders, and presence of dense herbaceous understory vegetation. Household survey data revealed that deer were observed within some fenced areas. Our findings do not provide strong evidence that deer-excluding fences at properties smaller than 3.5 hectares surpress blacklegged ticks.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) in southernAfrica provide refuge to important megafauna such as the savannah elephant ( Loxodonta africana). Sections of these protected areas are often transfrontier conservation complexes, whose objective is to facilitate historic patterns of animal dispersal. Knowledge of megafauna home ranges, habitat use, and dispersal in key PAs can inform vital decision-making for elephant conservation. Location data were derived from satellite collars fitted on 26 savannah elephants from 2016 to 2022 in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe to investigate seasonal and sex differences in elephants' home range sizes, home range overlap, and their interaction with environmental variables. Differences in the size of home ranges between sexes in all seasons were not significant. Both male and female elephants had high site fidelity, retaining 60% of their home ranges between consecutive seasons. Only females, possibly tracking forage quality, showed reduced overlap of home ranges between the hot dry and hot wet seasons. Male elephants preferred vegetation types dominated by Colophospermum mopane, whereas females used more diverse upland vegetation types, showing a preference for higher elevations than males over all seasons. In areas where elephant movement is restricted by fences and human settlements, continuous monitoring of elephant space use is recommended, and research dynamics should be taken into account when developing site- specific management plans.

AB  - Grazing is the dominant land use across the world, and large mammalian herbivores exert strong influence over biogeochemical cycles. Grazing ecosystems feature C-rich soils, even though herbivores consume a major fraction of plant production to reduce detrital input to soil. Yet, counter-intuitively, moderate grazing can promote net soil-C storage in many ecosystems compared to grazer-exclusion. We address this enigmatic influence of grazers on soil-C and test their indirect effect on proximate drivers of decomposition: microbial extracellular enzyme activity. We used a replicated long-term grazer-exclusion experiment to measure responses in above- and belowground plant biomass, soil-C stock, microbial biomass, labile/recalcitrant C pools and three enzymes relevant to the C-cycle: peroxidase-which initiates decomposition of recalcitrant matter, alongside beta-glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase-which act further downstream on more labile fractions. Consistent with other ecosystems, upto 12 years of herbivore exclusion did not increase soil-C in the fenced plots despite higher plant biomass and higher potential detrital C-inputs. Grazer-exclusion did not alter microbial biomass; peroxidase increased threefold and beta-glucosidase was doubled; cellobiohydrolase was unaffected. Grazer-exclusion also led to twofold increase in recalcitrant-C and in microbial respiration, but it did not influence labile-C. Structural equation models supported the hypothesis that grazing favours soil-C via its indirect effect on peroxidase, but they did not support that the effects can run in the opposite direction where soil-C affects enzymes. Grazer-mediated shifts in how microbes deploy enzymes emerge as a plausible mechanism that affects soil-C. These linkages may be important to maintain soil-C sequestration in drylands which support large mammalian herbivores.

AB  - Upper-elevation mesic Hawaiian forests have been transformed by cattle ranching and invasive ungulates within the past 200 years. Although the flora and fauna of the Hawaiian Islands have been radically altered by the introduction of invasive species, there is a movement of agriculturalists within the islands interested in reintroducing native species and reforestation in agricultural spaces. One of the keystone species in the Hawaiian Islands is the endemic tree species Acacia koa, known for its ecosystem services and cultural importance. This species is valuable for nitrogen fixation, aquifer recharge, habitat for biodiversity and usefulness in agroforestry systems. This investigation is focused on the relationship between the tree species A. koa and the forage grass species Pennisetum clandestinum (kikuyu) in a silvopastoral context, at an elevation of 5,200 feet above sea level (1585 masl) on the island of Maui. The site of investigation is called Pu'u Makua in Hawaiian and is situated on the southwestern flank of Haleakala (10,023 feet above sea level-3055 masl) and is part of Ulupalakua Ranch. A total of n = 28 forage samples of P. clandestinum were taken in dry season, 21 of which were taken from underneath the canopies of koa trees (which had been planted in densities of 3, 4, and 6 m apart). The other seven samples were taken in full sun (where no koa trees were growing). This same protocol (sampling n = 28) was repeated in the wet season. Forage samples were then sent to the Agricultural Diagnostics Laboratory at the University of Hawai`i at Manoa for forage analysis to compare attributes of kikuyu under different canopy densities of A. koa. To better understand the leaf area index (LAI) of the canopy of various densities of A. koa, hemispheric (180 degree) photos were taken and then input into Gap Light Analyzer Software for LAI. LAI data of A. koa as well as forage attributes of P. clandestinum were then input into the statistical software InfoStat to investigate relationships between canopy cover and forage quality at each specific location. It was found through Pearson correlation analysis that there are in fact significant relationships between koa and the quality of kikuyu. Measurements of koa trees were also taken to estimate biomass and the amount of carbon sequestered within each tree. These measurements were input into allometric equations specific to koa growing on the Island of Maui that were created by the United States Forest Service. Lastly, to better understand the knowledge of ranchers on Maui, we conducted surveys regarding various ranchers' perceptions of native and non-native trees and their usefulness for silvopastoral ranching systems. Ranchers also identified various tree species that were of use (or harmful) to their operations. Since A. koa was on this list of helpful trees and conferred various ecosystem services and agroecological benefits, the incorporation of koa into ranching systems on the island of Maui is recommended in zones appropriate for its growth.

AB  - Questions Plant facilitation often dominates over competition in stressful environments. However, to our knowledge few studies have examined plant facilitation within the context of herbivore pressure. Herbivory-induced is a classic example of indirect facilitation. For example, in the temperate steppe region of Inner Mongolia, China, the intensive grazing by domestic animals has induced widespread grassland degradation. Here, we ask whether such long-term overgrazing leads to facilitation in plants.
   Location Xilingol steppe region, Inner Mongolia, China.
   Methods We examined the spatial structure of three dominant plant species, including two species that are palatable to sheep (Leymus chinensis and Agropyron michnoi) and one that is unpalatable (Stipa grandis). We examined whether the spatial aggregation of these three species provided evidence for facilitation by comparing their spatial patterns along a recovery gradient: high grazing pressure (HG), an eight-years grazing exclusion (early-stage recovery from grazing; ER), and a 21-years grazing exclusion (late-stage recovery; LR). To accomplish this, we used the bivariate pair-correlation function, g(12)(r), to assess the spatial association between unpalatable and palatable species. A positive spatial association indicates that facilitation dominates over competition (or dispersal limitation, habitat heterogeneity). We used a null model to assess the significance of spatial associations. Furthermore, we evaluated intraspecific spatial aggregation with the g(11)(r) by combining to three null models at fine spatial scales.
   Results The spatial association between palatable and unpalatable species suggests a hump-shaped relationship along the gradient of the grazing exclusion time. Specifically, Leymus chinensis and Stipa grandis showed a neutral, positive and negative association across the three stages of natural recovery from 21 years of grazing exclusion to current grazing. Similarly, Agropyron michnoi and Stipa grandis showed a negative, very positive and positive spatial association along the same gradient. Moreover, intraspecific spatial aggregation was higher in the current grazing treatment than in the grazing exclusion treatment. This was particularly true at the finest spatial scales (i.e., <0.2 m).
   Conclusions Our results suggest that facilitation between and within species along the recovery gradient in steppe communities is related to herbivore pressure induced by long-term overgrazing. First, we observed no evidence of indirect facilitation between species in current grazing treatment, while direct facilitation between plant species appears strongest at early stages of natural recovery along the gradient of the grazing exclusion time. Moreover, we observed indirect intraspecific facilitation dominated in the current grazing treatment, especially at small scales across the same gradient.

AB  - Historical climate change and human exploitation are thought to have played important roles in shaping population dynamics of sub-Antarctic marine predators, such as king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) and Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazelle). For example, Antarctic fur seals on the sub-Antarctic South Georgia Island were nearly hunted to extinction by humans before the early 1900s. However, records of occupation history pre- and post-anthropogenic stress are often sporadic and challenging to interpret. In this study, we investigated paleoecological proxies in sediment cores from South Georgia Island to examine past marine predator population dynamics in the face of climate change and exploitation pressure. Sediment cores representing 1854 CE to present were collected from two sites on South Georgia Island in the South Atlantic and analyzed for geochemical (total carbon, total nitrogen, delta C-13 and delta N-15 values) and biological (e.g., seal hairs, penguin feathers) proxies. Proxies in both cores indicated the onset of the recovery of penguin and fur seal populations in the early to mid-1900s, following the cessation of hunting. Additionally, our results suggest marked increases in both penguin and seal populations beginning around 1950 CE. Between the 1950s and 2019, 97% of South Georgia Island's glaciers retreated associated with recent climatic warming. This warming increased the availability of local breeding areas for king penguins, which likely explains the population rise during that time. This study deepens our understanding of the response of sub-Antarctic marine predator populations to past climate change and human exploitation, which may aid in predicting future ecosystem responses to environmental disturbance.

AB  - Agriculture is an essential production system used to feed the growing human population, but at the same time has become a major driver of biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. Employing production methods that restore degraded landscapes can have a positive impact on biodiversity, whilst improving food production. We assessed how mammalian biodiversity, specifically richness and their relative abundances varied on five Karoo farms in South Africa that had been amalgamated and subjected to a transition from traditional livestock grazing techniques (sporadic rotational grazing and lethal predator control) to wildlife-friendly non-lethal predator management, using human shepherding of livestock under a high-density short-duration grazing regime. We used camera trap data collected over a 4-year period, to measure mammalian species richness, distribution and relative abundance on the wildlife-friendly farm to investigate temporal changes throughout the conversion from traditional farming practices. In the last year of the study (2019) additional cameras were used to provide a spatial comparison of mammalian species on the wildlife-friendly farm to two neighboring farms, a traditional livestock farm using lethal predator controls, and a game farm. We found that mammalian species richness increased year on year resulting in a significant increase of 24% over the duration of the study. Herbivores showed an increase of 33% in the number of species detected over the years, while predator species increased by 8%. The relative abundance and distribution of most species also showed increases as the conversion process took place. For example, 73% of the herbivore species detected throughout the study increased in their relative abundance. Similarly, 67% of all species showed an increase in the number of sites occupied over the years. In the final year of the study the wildlife-friendly farm had more mammalian species compared to the game farm and traditional livestock farm, with the latter two sites having a similar number of species when compared to the commencement of the conversion of the wildlife-friendly site. These broad improvements in mammalian biodiversity demonstrate that livestock production can benefit local mammalian biodiversity through a combination of herder grazing management and wildlife-friendly farming.

AB  - For the past several decades, both species biodiversity and productivity of desert steppe have been reduced due to excessive use and climate factors. To counteract this, Chinese government has supported large-scale grassland ecological restoration programs since the year 2000. The policy needs a standard for the evaluation of the effects of such restorative measures on the grasslands after decades. Grassland insect diversity plays an important role in the maintenance of plant species and functional diversity. To understand the relation of grazing management and insect diversity, we use a complete two factor design, two fencing periods (3 or 7 years) and three grazing intensities (0, 6, or 12 sheep per ha), to examine the response of the insect diversity to fencing and grazing in desert steppe. We found almost no significant differences in either plant or insect species diversity between the sites fenced for 3 and 7 years, as the pressure of grazing increased, insect diversity decreased to a greater extent at 7-year enclosure sites than at 3-year sites. We recommend the most suitable grazing intensity for the sustainability of biodiversity of the desert steppe in Inner Mongolia is light grazing (8 sheep/ha 0.5 yr(-1)), and the most suitable fencing period is three years, which suggest that policies that remove livestock from the desert grassland for long periods (7 + years) are not beneficial for maintaining insect diversity, and heavy grazing lead ecological environment weaker and insect diversity decreasing. Thus, periodic livestock grazing is important in the design of management actions to preserve biodiversity.

AB  - Most European rewilding initiatives are based on the recovery of large herbivores, particularly European bison Bison bonasus, aiming at restoring ecosystem processes and increase trophic complexity. The growing support for the release of bison as a wild species, and change its legal status, in Spain, as an ecological analogue of the extinct steppe bison Bison priscus, makes it an excellent example to reflect the limits of a rewilding biogeographically advisable. We discuss if this initiative could be justified from ecological, biogeographical, ethical, and legal reasons. Besides remarkable taxonomic and functional differences between both bison species, the Mediterranean environment, under the present and future climatic scenarios, does not suit the European bison. Furthermore, there is no evidence to support the presumption that the European bison was ever present in the Iberian Peninsula, with legal implications. We expect that our approach will be inspirational for similar assessments on rewilding initiatives globally.

AB  - Biocultural conservation approaches recognise the relationships between nature and humans, and arc built on local cultural perspectives. Hawai'i has been described as a model for biocultural conservation, and a biocultural approach can be applied in endangered ecosystems such as tropical dry forests that are often found in human settlement areas. The extent of native tropical dry forest cover remaining in Hawai'i is as low as 1% on some islands, with 45% of the tropical dry forest plant species at risk of extinction. Despite the long-running relationship of tropical dry forests with 'Indigenous people and local communities', there has been little assessment of the potential social -ecological outcomes of a biocultural approach to tropical dry forest restoration. Two Hawaii forest restoration projects, located within Kalipalehu and Auwahi, have been excluding ungulates and removing alien plant species for >20 years, and have applied biocultural approaches. Drawing on these two sites as case-studies, we explore the motivations for, and components of, a biocultural approach, and highlight four categories (ecological, social, cultural, and spiritual) of biocultural measures of success. We show that a biocultural approach to restoration can provide purpose and meaning to a person's relationship to place, and can transform conservation biology through Indigenous perspectives. We also address challenges and provide recommendations to those interested in engaging in a biocultural approach.

AB  - Land-use change underpins the ongoing biodiversity crisis. Although such impacts are particularly acute across endemic-rich oceanic islands, little is known for afro-tropical islands. Here we assessed insectivorous bat responses to different land-use types of the island of Sao Tome<acute accent>, in Central West Africa. Since its human colonization in the mid-15th century, Sao Tome<acute accent> lost over 70 % of its native habitat, mostly to shaded and oil palm plantations, agriculture, and urban areas, while part of that was abandoned allowing secondary forests to re-grow. Using passive acoustic monitoring, we surveyed insectivorous bats in 115 sites across each land-use type over one month. We then examined bat species richness and activity, and species-specific activity. Based on 5520 h of recordings, we obtained 19,744 bat passes from five of the six taxa known to occur on the island, three of which are endemics. Both species richness and activity were highest in the four non-forest land-use types, with activity further decreasing with altitude. Species-specific responses corresponded to foraging guild: the forest foragers Hipposideros ruber and Macronycteris thomensis showed higher activity in forests and shaded plantations, the activity of the open-space foragers Chaerephon spp. peaked in urban areas, while that of the edge forager Miniopterus newtoni was highest in oil palm plantations. The island's insectivorous bats are persisting despite land-use change, including island endemics. Maintaining the mosaic of land-use types, including native forests, is likely to help sustain insectivorous bat diversity in this tropical island.

AB  - In a 1975 review, red kangaroos in the arid rangelands of Australia were said to be favoured with an anomalous prosperity following the introduction of ruminant livestock. In the western and central locations reviewed, this was not sustained, but in the sheep rangelands of Southern Australia, it is often claimed that such prosperity continues. Here, as elsewhere, the marsupial herbivore guild (kangaroos, wallabies, bettongs and bandicoots) has been simplified by the extinction of the smaller species (the anomaly), while large kangaroos remain abundant. However, the mammalian herbivore guild has gained complexity with not only the introduction of managed ruminant livestock, some of which run wild, but also game like rabbits. We studied the population dynamics, habitat selection and individual mobility of red, western and eastern grey kangaroos, common wallaroos, Merino sheep, feral goats and European rabbits at Fowlers Gap Station in far northwestern New South Wales, Australia. This site is representative of the arid chenopod (Family: Chenopodiaceae) shrublands stocked with sheep, where sheep and red kangaroos dominate the mammalian herbivores by biomass. The study site comprised two contiguous pairs of stocked and unstocked paddocks: a sloping run-off zone and a flat run-on zone, covering a total area of 2158 ha. This three-year study included initial rain-deficient (drought) months followed by more regular rainfall. Red kangaroos showed avoidance of sheep when given the opportunity and heightened mobility in response to localized drought-breaking storms and dispersion of the sheep flock at lambing. Western grey kangaroos were sedentary and did not dissociate from sheep. These effects were demonstrated at the population level and the individual level through radio-tracking a small cohort of females. The other kangaroo species and goats were transient and preferred other habitats. Rabbits were persistent and localized without strong interactions with other species. The results are discussed with a focus on the red kangaroo and some causes for its resilience in the sheep rangelands.

AB  - Juvenile corals and their spatio-temporal changes are essential predictors in assessing the recovery of coral reef after disturbances, including by coral bleaching. To gain a deeper understanding, we conducted observations of juvenile corals before and after the 2016 coral bleaching event and their relationship with reef-associated biota at ten permanent monitoring sites in the Pieh Islands Marine Tourism Park (PIMTP), West Sumatera, Indonesia. Our study reveals a decrease in the abundance of juvenile corals following the 2016 bleaching, amounting to approximately 26%, primarily affecting juveniles of Montipora, Acropora, and Pocillopora, with no significant changes observed. The dominant juvenile corals, Montipora, Pocillopora, and Acropora, before the bleaching event were replaced by Pavona and Porites, which persisted and increased post-bleaching. While several genera were not found, new genera emerged. Despite these changes in species composition, species diversity remained unaffected. Although an increase in the abundance of juvenile corals correlated with live coral cover, the correlation was low and negative. The presence of algae as niche competitors exhibited a different correlation compared to previous studies and did not impact coral juveniles significantly, with herbivorous reef fish showing a reasonable control effect. Rubble, serving as a substrate for larval settlement and a micro-habitat for juvenile coral development, exhibited a negative correlation. Our research delineates the temporal changes in young coral populations pre and post the 2016 coral bleaching event. These findings contribute to the scientific understanding that juvenile coral serves as a critical predictor of coral reef resilience and recovery from bleaching, emphasizing its implications for coral reef conservation.

AB  - We examined hypotheses of spatial association arising from exclusion or indirect competitive interactions, using 13 years of gridded mammal census data from Kruger National Park, South Africa. As interactions occur at different scales, we explored the data at 1, 5, 10, and 15 km(2). We proposed four hypotheses structuring the mammal community: H1, predator exclusion of herbivores by carnivores (apparent direct competition); H2-H4: indirect competition produced by each of three types of herbivore diet specialization: H2, ruminants and non-ruminants; H3, grazers and browsers, and H4, a four-way division of small and large grazers and browsers. We used the software CoOccur to implement a robust test for evidence of our hypotheses against null models of community assemblage. At 5, 10, and 15 km(2) scales, the results supported a competition/exclusion mechanism in the majority of years for hypotheses H1, H3, and H4, and facilitation in H2. At the finest spatial scale (1 km2), we saw patterns resembling a mixture of competitive, neutral and facilitative process. These results suggest strong, large-scale effects of interspecific interactions on distributions of African megafauna, which may not operate at a more local (1 km(2)) scale, underscoring the importance of scale and mechanism in the guild structure of communities.

AB  - Mexican islands are an important biodiversity reservoir that is threatened by the introduction of invasive exotic species. In recent times, Socorro island, Revillagigedo Archipelago, has experienced significant environmental disturbances including population outbreaks from the Centro American locust (Schistocerca piceifrons). Since S. piceifrons can cause significant damage on native plants, the present study evaluated the population status of S. piceifrons at Socorro island and its effect upon native vegetation. Also, we evaluated historic annual locust abundance in relation to climatic variables in the island. We sampled S. piceifrons in 25 island sites with different vegetation types, once during the dry season and once in the rainy season of 2018. We also evaluated herbivory on most common plants. We did not observe any S. piceifrons gregarious behavior and solitary locusts were more abundant during the rainy season. Herbivory levels were low (< 7%). We detected that locust abundance was associated to moderate temperature years with high atmospheric humidity. Since outbreaks have been reported previously, we recommend continuing locust monitoring, however current situation does not suggest to start any control measures on S. piceifrons populations.

AB  - The one-host cattle fever tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus (Say), and southern cattle fever tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Canestrini), are important ectoparasitic pests of cattle, Bos taurus L., mostly for transmitting the causal agents of bovine babesiosis. Bovine babesiosis inflicted substantial cattle production losses in the United States before the vectors were eliminated by 1943, with the exception of a Permanent Quarantine Zone in South Texas, a buffer along the Mexico border where the invasive ixodids remain. As suitable hosts, infested white-tailed deer and nilgai antelope populations disperse R. annulatus and R. microplus, which increases the risk for emergence of bovine babesiosis in the United States. A R. microplus incursion first detected in 2016 on the South Texas coastal plain wildlife corridor involved infestations on cattle, nilgai antelope, white-tailed deer, and vegetation. Efforts at passive sampling of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) spp. on hosts are concentrated in the Permanent Quarantine Zone. Hence, a knowledge gap exists on the full extent of the recent incursions. Area-wide, systematic, active sampling and supportive research, involving the Permanent Quarantine Zone, Temporary Quarantine Zone, most of the coastal plain, and other parts of Texas outside of the quarantine zones, are needed to bridge the knowledge gap. Herein, we provide research perspectives and rationale to develop and implement systematic active sampling that will provide an increasingly accurate assessment of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) spp. distribution in Texas. We suggest that this is essential to advance integrated vector-borne animal disease eradication approaches for keeping cattle free of bovine babesiosis.

AB  - In marine ecosystems, fishing often targets predators, which can drive direct and indirect effects on entire food webs. Marine reserves can induce trophic cascades by increasing predator density and body size, thereby increasing predation pressure on populations of herbivores, such as sea urchins. In California's northern Channel Islands, two species of sea urchins are abundant: the red urchin Mesocentrotus franciscanus, which is targeted by an economically valuable fishery, and the virtually unfished purple urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. We hypothesized that urchin populations inside marine reserves would be depressed by higher predation, but that red urchins would be less affected due to fishing outside reserves. Instead, our analyses revealed that purple urchin populations were unaffected by reserves, and red urchin biomass significantly increased in response to protection. Therefore, urchin biomass overall has increased inside reserves, and we found no evidence that giant kelp is positively affected by reserves. Our results reveal the overwhelming direct effect of protecting fished species in marine reserves over indirect effects that are often predicted but seldom clearly documented. Indirect effects due to marine reserves may eventually occur in some cases, but very effective predators, large reserves or extended time periods may be needed to induce them.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are invading many areas globally and impacting biodiversity and economies in their non-native range. Thus, wild pigs are often targeted for eradication efforts. Age- and sex-specific body measurements are important for informing these eradication efforts because they reflect body condition, resource availability, and fecundity, which are common indicators of population trajectory. However, body mass is often difficult to collect, especially on large individuals that require specialized equipment or multiple people to weigh. Measurements that can be rapidly taken by a single land or wildlife manager on any size wild pig without aid from specialized equipment would be beneficial if they accurately infer wild pig body mass. Our goals were to assess whether morphometric measurements could accurately predict wild pig body mass, and to provide tools to directly input these measures and estimate wild pig body mass. Using linear models, we quantified the relationship between body mass and morphometric measurements (i.e., body length, chest girth, ear length, eye to snout length, hindfoot length, shoulder length, and tail length) from a subset (n = 102) of wild pigs culled at the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, Mississippi, USA. We evaluated separate models for each individual morphometric measurement. We then used the model coefficients to develop equations to predict wild pig body mass. We validated these equations predicting body mass of 1592 individuals collected across eight areas in Australia, Guam, and the USA for cross-validation. Each developed equation remained accurate when cross-validated across regions. Body length, chest girth, and shoulder length were the morphometrics that best predicted wild pig body mass. Our analyses indicated it is possible to use the presented equations to infer wild pig body mass from simple metrics.

AB  - Herbivorous fish are key to maintaining a balance between coral and algae on reefs, where reefs with greater herbivore biomass often show lower algal cover. For reefs worldwide, algal turf cover is expanding and is increasingly used as an indicator of disturbance. Water depth affects reef fish composition; thus, it may be expected that herbivory could also differ by depth. We examined relationships between algal turf cover and biomass (g m(-2)), density (# m(-2)) and size (cm) of herbivore groups (grazers, browsers and scrapers) across shallow (< 6 m), mid (6-18 m) and deep (18-30 m) coral reefs in the Main Hawaiian Islands. We find that across all depth classes, algal turf cover decreased with increasing grazer and scraper density, with steeper relationships observed at mid and deep reefs than in shallow reefs. In contrast, algal turf cover slightly increased with increasing grazer and browser biomass at deep reefs. Considering fish size, algal turf cover increased with larger grazer and scrapers at mid and deep reefs. The results indicate that herbivorous fish density, rather than biomass, is a better indicator of reductions in algal turf cover and resulting coral-algal balance on Hawaiian reefs, where smaller fish exert greater top-down control on cover than larger fish. Despite significant differences in herbivorous fish compositions, length-frequency distributions and fishing intensities across depth, algal turf cover remains similar across depths. Increases in fishing would have a disproportionately negative impact in deep than shallow reefs due to a lower overall fish density, where grazing functions in deep reefs are maintained by significantly fewer and smaller grazers and browsers, and larger scrapers, than in shallow reefs. Developing an understanding of patterns of algal turf herbivory by depth is important to understanding the spatial scale at which herbivory and regime shifts operate.

AB  - Understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of animal road mortality is important for planning protective measures and raising driver awareness. In our study of Lithuania, spanning from 2002 to 2022, we examined these patterns based on road types and categorized them by working days, weekends, and long weekends, predicting the potential impact of transitioning to a four-day working week. We found that road type explains 22-50% of the variability in roadkill numbers for moose, red deer, wild boar, and roe deer. The highest occurrences were on main roads, while regional roads had the fewest incidents. The overall number of roadkills, especially those involving ungulates, was highest on weekends, followed by workdays, with the least on long weekends. However, these variations lacked statistical significance, and their effect size was small. We also observed a trend of increased roadkill numbers on the day before, the first day, notably on All Saints Day, or the last day of long weekends. In this context, with the introduction of a four-day work week, we are only expecting the highest roadkill numbers to move from Friday to Thursday.

AB  - Adjustments or complete withdrawal of livestock grazing are among the most common conservation actions in semiarid uplands, but outcomes can vary considerably with ecological context. Invasion by exotic annual grasses and the excessive wildfire they promote are increasing threats to semiarid shrub-steppe, and plant-community response to livestock exclusion in these areas may be complicated by the rapid colonization ability of invaders. We evaluated vegetation-community changes over 14-year interval (2007-2021) in a shrub-steppe landscape where a >100-year history of livestock grazing had been terminated in 1996. Field surveys revealed that bare-soil exposure decreased >20% over the 14 years owing to biomass accumulation, but this was primarily due to large increases in exotic annual "cheatgrass" (Bromus tectorum, +1.8-fold) and the litter it produces (+1.5-fold). Soil biocrusts increased 11.9% and perennial bunchgrasses increased 3% over the 14 years. These community changes varied at the patch scale and entailed inverse relationships of (1) both cheatgrass and biocrusts to plant-community basal cover, (2) cheatgrass to both biocrusts and perennial grasses, and (3) biocrusts to cheatgrass and litter. The spatiotemporal variability in vegetation constituted changes in plant-community states, according to cluster analysis. The modeled probability of a community transitioning to a cheatgrass state was (1) strongly and positively related to the initial (2007) cover of cheatgrass in hotspots where initial cheatgrass cover was >20%, and (2) negatively related to biocrust cover where initial biocrust cover was >4% of ground area. The decision space for this landscape can be framed as a shifting from acceptance towards resisting further degradation by removing livestock and their trampling of soil surfaces and utilization of perennial herbs. However, cheatgrass appears to be the most impactful agent of change and continued invasion appears imminent. Active restoration may help resist further degradation and direct change towards tolerable conditions.

AB  - It is indisputable that much of Australias modern biodiversity decline was triggered by European settlement. However, the driver(s) of pre-European extinctions and extirpations are more challenging to identify, particularly on islands where animals are faced with the additional pressures imposed by isolation. Kangaroo Island, South Australia, has been identified as a potential haven for the reintroduction of endangered animals, but the genetic relationship between reintroduction candidates on the mainland and their extinct relatives on Kangaroo Island is poorly understood. Here, we present a late Pleistocene to mid-Holocene genetic record from Kangaroo Island based on bulk bone metabarcoding of two thousand bone fragments excavated from Kelly Hill Cave. We detect 33 species of bird, reptile, fish and mammal and report additional intra-specific genetic diversity in Kangaroo Islands now extinct population of spotted-tailed quoll. Furthermore, we provide genetic evidence that the Eastern grey kangaroo formerly inhabited Kangaroo Island. Taken together, these data establish a more complete baseline of local biodiversity against which reintroduction programmes and bushfire recovery measures can be evaluated, which is more important than ever in light of the recent fires that devastated much of Kangaroo Islands flora and fauna. 0 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Trapping is an effective strategy for control of invasive wild pig (Sus scrofa), but eradication of populations via trapping alone typically is impractical throughout much of the species' introduced range. Consequently, recovery of wild pig populations to pre-trapping levels following control is a major impediment to success of long-term control. In this study, we conducted camera-trap surveys to monitor recovery of two wild pig populations immediately following density reductions achieved via trapping on two sites on the Savannah River Site, SC. We used spatial capture-recapture models to estimate wild pig density during seven 3 week periods spanning 12 months to: (1) determine the time required for populations to recover to pre-trapping levels; and (2) evaluate trends in population growth, density, and distribution during recovery. Recovery of both wild pig populations started immediately after trapping ceased, with populations reaching pre-trapping levels in 3 and 5 months. Threeweek population growth rates for each wild pig population during recovery averaged 1.28 (range = 1.11-1.39 on site 1) and 1.24 (range = 0.64-1.92 on site 2), which corresponded to a 345% and 132% increase in abundance (an increase of 141 and 126 individual wild pigs on site 1 and 2, respectively) of each population by the last survey period. Rapid recovery and growth beyond pre-trapping levels of wild pig populations likely were driven by residual wild pigs not removed by trapping and compensatory reproduction and immigration. Our study is one of the first to provide information on how quickly wild pig populations can recover following overall density reductions of 54-68% and indicates practitioners should be prepared to reinitiate trapping efforts in as little as 3 months to prevent recovery of wild pig populations following control.

AB  - Current ecological communities are in a constant state of flux from climate change and from species introductions. Recent discussion has focused on the positive roles introduced species can play in ecological communities and on the importance of conserving resilient ecosystems, but not how these two ideas intersect. There has been insufficient work to define the attributes needed to support ecosystem resilience to climate change in modern communities. Here, I argue that non-invasive, introduced plant species could play an important role in supporting the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. Using examples from multiple taxonomic groups and ecosystems, I discuss how introduced plants can contribute to ecosystem resilience via their roles in plant and insect communities, as well as their associated ecosystem functions. I highlight the current and potential contributions of introduced plants and where there are critical knowledge gaps. Determining when and how introduced plants are contributing to the resilience of ecosystems to climate change will contribute to effective conservation strategies.
   In this perspective, I argue that we need to rethink the way we consider introduced plants in the resiliency of ecosystems to climate change. Given the ability of introduced species to tolerate and adapt to a broad range of environmental conditions, I suggest that introduced plants may fulfill a similar functional role as native plants that have been lost and/or provide a critical role that cannot (yet) be performed by 'local' native plant species. I propose that we need a clearer picture of the complex roles that introduced species play in our ecosystems and how they respond to climate change.image

AB  - Mixed forests created by incorporating nitrogen-fixing tree species offer enhanced ecological advantages compared with forests consisting of only one type of tree species. These benefits include habitat rehabilitation and the promotion of biodiversity. Nevertheless, the impact of introducing nitrogen-fixing tree species on ecosystem carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) sequestration and storage capacity in the Loess Plateau of China remains inadequately explored. To examine changes in the sequestration and storage capacity of ecosystem C, N, and P, the mixed plantations of P. tabulaeformis and H. rhamnoides (HrPt) were selected as the research object, and the pure plantations of H. rhamnoides (Hr) and P. tabulaeformis (Pt) were selected as the control. The results indicated that in comparison to the pure forest, the ecosystem in HrPt significantly increased C and N stocks but decreased P stocks. In addition, C, N, and P stocks in the soil layer accounted for more than 60% of the C, N, and P stocks in the pure and mixed forest ecosystems compared with the vegetation layer. Moreover, HrPt significantly improved ecosystem C and N sequestration rates relative to the pure forest but decreased P sequestration rates. Furthermore, the soil physicochemical properties can be inferred from the redundancy analysis showing 66.79% and 0.06% in Hr, 44.84% and 0.06% in Pt, as well as 44.28% and 0.04% in HrPt, respectively. In conclusion, compared with the pure forest, the introduction of N-fixing tree species was more conducive to the accumulation of C and N. The results offer substantial significance for the scientific guidance of vegetation restoration in degraded landscapes and the stewardship of mixed forests in the Loess Hilly Region, providing essential data for nutrient storage in ecosystems.

AB  - This study investigates wolf (Canis lupus) dietary preferences and their geographical variation by calculating frequency of occurrence and biomass consumption in three areas in the north-western Iberian Peninsula that differ in terms of the type and abundance of potential prey. Wolf dietary preferences were expected to be related to the availability of a species of free-roaming horses (Equus ferus atlanticus) and much less to traditional livestock in each habitat. The diet of wolves was found to comprise mostly Galician feral horses when available, with a low proportion of livestock. The next most consumed species were wild boar (Sus scrofa) and cattle (Bos taurus taurus). A much higher consumption of traditional livestock (84% biomass) was observed in the one study area where there were no feral horses. The fact that access to feral horses may help decrease wolf predation on other species of livestock which are more economically important and the environmental benefits of horses in protecting against forest fires suggest that conservation and expansion of this endangered species of horses should be encouraged. Strengthening existing populations and possibly re-introducing native wild species within the wolf's range may be the most environmentally friendly way to reduce economic losses for farmers and cattle breeders.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the impact of short grazing periods with high-stocking density on vegetation during weather conditions favorable to plant growth. Continuous grazing is widely practiced in Tunisian arid rangelands and across most drylands and deserts of the Middle East and North Africa. In the early 1990s, the Tunisian government combined a variety of incentives and restrictions on rangeland grazing practices and initiated a national strategy for rangeland improvement. The strategy emphasizes grazing exclusion for three consecutive years, a practice known locally as gdel. At the end of this period, grazing is allowed with no restrictions or with some guidelines. However, these regulations created discontent among pastoral communities, mainly when local rainfall conditions result in a considerable quantity of green biomass. High stocking-density grazing for a short period would help satisfy pastoralist concerns and achieve the government's strategic goal. This study was implemented in three arid rangeland types of southern Tunisia that have been under restricted grazing for 2 years. Each area in the study was grazed for short periods in late May (about 7 days) with a flock of 150 head of sheep. Measurements of vegetation cover, forage productivity, density, and species richness were taken before and after grazing. Our results suggest that perennial vegetation is more stable under grazing than annual vegetation. The presence of annual species would enhance rangeland vegetation cover and diversity and at the same time offers an opportunity for livestock to select a high-quality diet rich in protein. Opportunistic grazing, applied to heterogeneous rangelands in late spring and the beginning of the annual temperature increase, encouraged animals to select annual plants due to their higher palatability, higher digestibility, and water content rather than heavily grazing perennial species. Perennial biomass materials that die and do not fall through rapid biological decay tended to decline with increased period of placement, resulting in further oxidation to CO2 which affects photosynthetic performance negatively and may eventually cause plant death. Trampling from high-density stocking enhances the litterfall rates and removes the oxidized plant material. These findings may contribute to strategies for addressing the extreme climatic variations that threaten rangeland and livestock sustainability.

AB  - Deer species play a key role in processes that maintain ecosystem community structure and composition. However, several of the species are considered at risk of extinction. One of the strategies for their conservation is the maintenance of legally protected areas in which administration is prescribed by a management plan. Species inventories form the basis of this instrument as it allows to identify key resources and taxons. We reviewed the management plans of Brazilian protected areas to assess the suitability of methods employed to identify deer species. We reviewed 118 management plans (covering 298,000 km(2) of protected area) and checked each occurrence record for information regarding detection methods, which we classified according to their suitability for species-level identification. We found that 38% of the records did not report the species detection method used. Specific identifications were obtained through seven different methodologies, of which 12% were considered suitable, 28% were suitable with caveats, and 60% were unsuitable for species identification. We conclude it is necessary to improve the scientific rigor applied to inventories and data collection to avoid producing further inconsistent information, as this might affect management actions and risks the exclusion of threatened species from public policies on conservation planning.

AB  - In tropical grazer assemblies with abundant large predators, smaller herbivores have been shown to be limited by predation and food quality, while the larger species are regulated by food abundance. Much less is known about herbivore resource partitioning in temperate grazing ecosystems, where humans typically regulate large animal abundances. The Oostvaardersplassen ecosystem in the Netherlands is a unique multispecies assemblage of cattle, horses, red deer, and geese developed after the initial introduction of a few individuals in 1983. During the first 35 years, this herbivore assemblage without predation or human regulation gradually changed into an increasing dominance of the smaller herbivore species. Carrying capacity was reached around 2008, after which numbers started fluctuating depending on winter conditions. From 2018, management changed and population numbers became regulated for biodiversity and animal welfare reasons; however, population numbers still remained close to carrying capacity for several years. We used eDNA metabarcoding of dung to quantify the diet composition of cattle, horses, red deer, and geese, annually in early winter from 2018 to 2021 and calculated their niche overlap. We found strong interspecific diet overlap. Horse and cattle diets remained mostly stable with fluctuating densities of the different species, while only red deer diet showed density dependence. Interspecific niche overlap decreased with increasing red deer population size, the most abundant species. When calculated as total energy expenditure, we found that niche overlap was more linked to red deer abundance than to total herbivore energy intake. We suggest that red deer changed their diet mainly in response to their own population size, reducing their niche overlap in relation to their population increase. In this case, resource competition reduced resource availability and forced herbivores to consume different plant taxa. We conclude that in this predator-free temperate ecosystem, inter- and intraspecific resource competition are key factors structuring this assemblage of different size herbivores. We find a general competitive advantage of the more diet-flexible red deer over horses and cattle, but with also clear signs of resource partitioning.

AB  - Agricultural intensification substantially threatens farmland communities and associated ecosystem services. More specifically, landscape simplification and agrochemical use can significantly alter the activity of natural enemies, contributing to hampered pest suppression. At the same time, the effects of these factors on vertebrate predators and their contribution to pest control are relatively understudied, especially in European permanent crops. Using exclosures in Hungarian vineyards, we investigated the effect of birds and bats on arthropods affecting ecosystem functions and crop yield considering the local management (organic vs. integrated pest management [IPM]) and contrasting landscape heterogeneity of the plantations. We also collected abundance data of the European grapevine moth (Lobesia botrana) and canopy-dwelling herbivorous and predatory arthropods and quantified fruit and leaf damage and sentinel prey predation associated with these groups. As opposed to summer bat activity, forested and connected landscapes promoted high insectivorous bird abundance and bat activity in spring and contributed to lower fruit damage caused by L. botrana. Vineyard management showed no effect on birds and bats. In contrast, canopy-dwelling arthropod density was higher in organic than in IPM vineyards, resulting in higher leaf herbivory and the occurrence of caterpillar predation there. Bird and bat exclusion increased leaf herbivory and fruit damage, leading to higher yields in control plots. Furthermore, increased bat activity significantly decreased the abundance of the major grape pest, L. botrana, in spring. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the importance of bats and birds in reducing herbivory and increasing economic benefits in vineyards. Their presence and foraging activity can be promoted by connected landscapes incorporating hedgerows and small groups of trees as well as native, deciduous forest patches that can potentially increase the amount of food sources and suitable nesting and roosting sites. Organic vineyards in these landscapes can further enhance pest control services by supporting predatory arthropods.

AB  - Tree seedling establishment outside forest boundaries is controlled by many interacting factors. Understanding the relative importance of different pressures is essential for improving techniques for forest restoration and for understanding the potential of forest boundaries to shift and adapt to changing climate conditions. We investigated constraints on the spread of a key southern hemisphere forest type into grasslands by undertaking a multifactorial experiment sowing Nothofagus cliffortioides (Nothofagaceae) in a historically deforested retired pasture. We manipulated factors to determine the relative effects of sheltered microsites, competition with pasture species, availability of ectomycorrhizal fungi, soil nutrients and rabbit herbivory, on seedling emergence and survival. Overall survival was low (11.7% after 6 months and 1.5% after 10 months), but there were strong treatment effects on both seedling establishment and survival. The availability of shelter and competition with pasture species had strongest effects, with the presence of pasture species initially aiding seedling emergence due to a sheltering effect, but negatively affecting survival at later stages. Most remaining seedlings at the conclusion of the experiment had formed ectomycorrhizae regardless of whether inoculum was supplied, and seedling survival and health was positively related to ectomycorrhizal colonization. Fertilizing had less of an effect than other factors, and results regarding rabbit herbivory were inconclusive. Synthesis and applications. This study provides new insights into how factors interact to limit tree seedling establishment in grasslands and forest expansion into neighbouring ecosystems. This improves understanding of the ability of an ectomycorrhizal keystone forest species to migrate and adapt to climate change. This study also assists restoration practitioners in selecting techniques that will enhance seedling establishment, and highlights that direct seeding approaches in open grasslands are unlikely to result in high rates of Nothofagus establishment.

AB  - Tropical seagrass beds are productive coastal ecosystems that are important blue carbon sinks and crucial habitats and feeding grounds for consumers at high trophic levels. To understand how energy sustains the ecosystem from seagrass production, we constructed an Ecopath trophic model to reveal the possible pathways of energy flow in the tropical seagrass beds around Dongsha Island, South China Sea. The model indicates that Dongsha seagrass beds were developing but well-structured ecosystems. The productive seagrasses were rarely directly consumed by herbivores and, ultimately, flowed into detrital pools. Detritus was the main food source used to support diverse consumers in the food web. Nevertheless, the low cycling rate (2.74%) suggests that most detritus was not reused or exported and was stored as a large organic carbon pool in the sediments. The detritus-feeding invertebrates are keystone groups in the Dongsha seagrass beds, as they recycle energy from detritus and transfer to top predators such as sharks. The predation of top predators affected the biomasses of other compartments, leading to strong top-down control via a trophic cascade effect.

AB  - How vegetation change caused by ungulates affects other ungulate species has been well studied, yet how grazing the vegetation of the habitat affects a species own food habits is not known. Long-term studies on the effects of sika deer (Cervus nippon) on vegetation have been performed, but not in the context of the species own food habits. I monitored grassland vegetation and deer food habits on an island in northern Japan for 25 years from 1975 to 2000. During the first decade, deer grazing caused the replacement of Miscanthus sinensis tussocks by a Zoysia japonica sward. Deer diets in 1976 were composed of equal proportions of M. sinensis, Pleioblastus chino, and Z. japonica, but after the 1980s, Z. japonica became their major food source. This is because of the high productivity of Z. japonica afforded by its morphology and physiology, as well as by the warm and humid summer climate of the Japanese archipelago. Although the vegetational changes were gradual, changes in the deer food habits were abrupt and the compositions were predominated by Z. japonica after the first decade. This study showed that an ungulate changed its own diet because of its effect on the vegetation by grazing, and that the changes in vegetation and deer diet were not synchronized over a 25-year monitoring period.

AB  - Social groups exist because some individuals within the group accrue a net benefit from sharing space. The profitability of sociality, however, varies with ecological context. As ecological context varies, tension emerges among the costs and benefits of social grouping. Fission-fusion societies are fluid in their group dynamics across spatial and temporal contexts, permitting insights into how context affects whether animals choose to join or depart from a group. We tested four nonmutually exclusive hypotheses driving variation in fission and fusion in caribou, Rangifer tarandus: (1) risky places, (2) environment heterogeneity, (3) activity budget and (4) social familiarity. The risky places hypothesis predicts that animals are unlikely to diffuse when habitats are open and the risk of predation is elevated. The habitat heterogeneity hypothesis predicts that fission is more likely in a heterogeneous landscape due to the rising conflicts of interest between group members. The activity budget hypothesis predicts that dyads associate by body size due to similar food passage rates. The social cohesion hypothesis predicts that familiar individuals are less likely to fission. We tested the hypotheses using time-to-event (time before fission) analyses and a linear model that assesses spatial, social and body size relationships among female caribou (N 1/4 22) on Fogo Island, Newfoundland, Canada. Contrary to our prediction for risky places, probability of fission was not influenced by habitat openness. The hypothesis of environmental heterogeneity was partially supported, as caribou remained less cohesive in environments with a higher richness of habitats. No direct evidence emerged to support the activity budget hypothesis. However, it appears that caribou maintain the strongest social bonds among variably sized individuals and that these social bonds do decrease the propensity to split. Collectively, our findings showed that social interactions may depend not only on individual identity and characteristics, but also on the spatial context in which these interactions occur.

AB  - Human activities alter marine ecosystems by modifying their biodiversity, often disrupting trophic interactions that determine their structure and functioning. Human influence on trophic interactions mediated by fishes have traditionally been investigated through the lens of indirect proxies, such as the biomass of trophic groups. However, fish biomass alone may not adequately capture the nuanced responses of fish to different levels of human pressures, such as changes in the nature and intensity of trophic interactions. Here, we combined visual counts and remote video surveys to assess how human pressures influence spatial patterns in reef fish biomass and feeding pressure in an oceanic island in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. The biomass and feeding pressure of reef fish assemblages strongly declined across the human pressure gradient, by two- and five-fold, respectively. These patterns were primarily driven by fishery targeted species, which comprised 87 % of fish biomass and 93 % of fish feeding pressure. Despite this marked imprint of human pressures, we found distinct responses among trophic groups. The biomass of omnivores and herbivores declined by 19- and 3-fold respectively, while feeding pressure by these groups declined by 6- and 4-fold, respectively. In contrast, the effect of human pressures on piscivores, invertivores and planktivores was weak or negligible. Importantly, some trophic groups exhibited stronger declines in fish feeding pressure than biomass, whilst others exhibited lower declines. This highlights the nuanced responses of fishes to human exploitation, with compensatory mechanisms, and calls for more detailed studies to identify how humans disrupt trophic interactions and their potential flow on effects on energy and material fluxes.

AB  - Despite contributing to the ongoing collapse of native mammal populations across northern Australian savannas, we have limited understanding of the ecological constraints of feral cat population density in this system. Addressing such knowledge gaps is a crucial step towards mitigating the impacts of feral cats, and is particularly important for the large islands off northern Australia that remain as strongholds for numerous species vulnerable to cat predation. Here, we investigated cat density across Melville and Bathurst Island, two large islands in Australia's monsoon tropics. We deployed large grids (similar to 13 km(2)) of 70 camera-traps at four locations to investigate how feral cat density varies under different combinations of fire frequency, and feral herbivore presence. Using spatially-explicit capture-recapture models, we estimated feral cat density on Melville Island to be 0.15 cats km(-2). We did not record any cat detections on Bathurst Island. Using simulations, we predicted that if cat density on Bathurst Island was equal to that on Melville Island, we would have expected to record 27.9 detections of 9.9 individual cats. Our results, coupled with other recent surveys, suggest that the density of cats is much lower on Bathurst Island than the adjacent Melville Island. The absence of feral herbivores on Bathurst Island may have contributed to this variation in cat density. Management that enhances understorey vegetation density, through feral herbivore control, as well as fire management, could help mitigate the impact of feral cats on northern Australian savanna biodiversity.

AB  - Similar to other insular birds around the world, the Galapagos rail (Laterallus spilonota Gould, 1841) exhibits reduced flight capacity following its colonization of the archipelago similar to 1.2 mya. Despite their short evolutionary history, rails have colonized seven different islands spanning the entire width of the archipelago. Galapagos rails were once common on islands with sufficiently high altitudes to support shrubs in humid habitats. After humans introduced goats, this habitat was severely reduced due to overgrazing. Habitat loss devastated some rail populations, with less than 50 individuals surviving, rendering the genetic diversity of Galapagos rail a pressing conservation concern. Additionally, one enigma is the reappearance of rails on the island of Pinta after they were considered extirpated. Our approach was to investigate the evolutionary history and geographic distribution of Galapagos rails as well as examine the genome-wide effects of historical population bottlenecks using 39 whole genomes across different island populations. We recovered an early divergence of rail ancestors leading to the isolated populations on Pinta and a second clade comprising the rest of the islands, historically forming a single landmass. Subsequently, the separation of the landmass similar to 900 kya may have led to the isolation of the Isabela population with more panmictic populations found on Santa Cruz and Santiago islands. We found that rails genomes contain long runs of homozygosity (>2 Mb) that could be related to the introduction of goats. Finally, our findings show that the modern eradication of goats was critical to avoiding episodes of inbreeding in most populations.

AB  - Mesophotic reefs, defined as reefs between 30 m and 150 m, have been less investigated than their shallower counterparts. Yet, more protected from human activities and bleaching events, they could be refuge zones allowing the resilience of shallow reefs. However, it is currently unknown if their role as refugia for species diversity also extends to functional diversity and thus potentially ecosystem functioning. Using an extensive video field surveys from Mayotte Island in the Western Indian Ocean, we analyzed how taxonomic diversity and functional diversity of coral reef fishes changed along a depth gradient from 10 to 100 m. We found that shallow and mesophotic reefs host different species, but that these dissimilar assemblages share similar richness combinations of traits values. However, when accounting for biomass of species, it appears that functional structure of assemblages differs along the depth gradient, with, for instance, herbivorous fishes being very scarce in deep reefs while large-bodied carnivorous are more abundant. Therefore, surveys of mesophotic fishes should assess not only species, but also trait composition, abundance and biomass. Overall, our results support the claim that extending marine protected areas to mesophotic reefs is required to maximize the protection of both species and functional diversities to eventually maintain coral reef ecosystem functioning and associated services across the broader seascape.

AB  - IntroductionThe end Pleistocene was a time of considerable ecological upheaval. Recent work has explored the megafauna extinction's role in altering ecosystem processes. Analyses of functional traits withing communities reveal hidden consequences of the megafauna extinction beyond declines in taxonomic diversity. Functional diversity analyses offer new insight into our understanding of past ecosystems and may even inform future rewilding efforts. However, the utility of functional diversity may be hampered by the use of discrete, taxon-level functional traits, such as dietary categories, that mask variation in functional diversity over space and time. MethodsWe present an approach in which species distribution modeling, in Maxent, provides context for interpreting variation in two widely used proxies for diet among fossil taxa: stable isotope analysis and dental microwear texture analysis. We apply this approach to two ecologically distinct taxa, the American mastodon (Mammut americanum) and mammoths (Mammuthus) and investigate their resource use over space and time from the last glacial maximum to the end Pleistocene (25-11.7 thousand years before present). ResultsMammoth dietary behavior varies by context across their geographic distribution, despite possessing evolutionary adaptations that facilitate grazing. Mammoths exhibit a preference for grazing where species distribution modeling predicts the highest likelihood of occurrence but engage in more mixed-feeding outside of core likelihood areas. In contrast, dietary preferences for mastodon are less resolved and our analyses were unable to identify significant differences in diet across their distribution. DiscussionThe ecological roles of some species are context specific and need to be critically evaluated when planning for management of reintroductions or introducing novel species to restore lost ecological function.

AB  - Simple Summary This study was carried out to control the plant Sarcopoterium spinosum in canakkale, Turkey. As a result of grazing, the number of grasses and legumes decreased and the number of shrubs increased. The number of species increased due to shrub control measures but decreased remarkably with grazing. (1) Background: The effects of prickly burnet (Sarcopoterium spinosum) control measures (pulling out, burning and cutting) and grazing on the botanical composition, grazeable dry matter (GDM) yield and nutritional values of rangeland were investigated on Imbros Island (Turkey) in 2010-2013. (2) Methods: The rangeland was grazed by Imbros sheep during the last year of the experiment. About 0.15 ha of rangeland was allocated to each sheep and five sheep were placed in each plot. Grazing was continuous throughout the year. (3) Results: Shrub levels decreased by 50-60% due to pulling out, burning and cutting in the first year and herbaceous species increased. Forbs increased more in the pulled and burnt plots and grasses increased more in the cut plots. In the third year, the shrub level increased to 60-65% and herbaceous species decreased. The decrease in herbaceous species was observed mostly in forbs. Plant cover was mostly (58%) composed of annual species. Development decreased plant cover ratios, but this decrease ceased in the burnt plot in the third year. Grazing also reduced plant cover. Crude protein (CP), NDF, ADF and digestible dry matter (DDM) content did not vary significantly over the experimental period. CP and DDM increased, NDF decreased and ADF did not change in the development plots. Overall, significant differences were not observed in GDM yield and nutritional values due to development efforts (pulling out, burning and cutting). (4) Conclusions: However, cutting is difficult over stony and rough terrain and pulling out creates erosion on sloping surfaces. Therefore, burning is recommended over the entire rangeland and burning or pulling out is recommended over smooth terrain for the temporary control of S. spinosum.

AB  - Introduction Environmental crimes, such as illegal hunting, trade, smuggling, poisoning, and harvesting of protected wildlife, rank among the world's top five illicit activities, contributing significantly to biodiversity loss. Wildlife forensic cases often involve multiple domestic and wild species and require a multidisciplinary approach for effective resolution. The enforcement of wildlife protection laws increasingly depends on molecular genetic methods.Goals In this study, I present three complex wildlife forensic cases involving the poisoning of the Eurasian griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), critically endangered (CR) in Israel, and the poaching of wildlife, including the Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana) and gazelles (Gazella spp.), particularly the endangered mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella).Results and Discussion These cases underscore the importance of integrating methodologies, beginning with species identification, population assignment, and individual sample matching using public and local genetic databases to ensure comprehensive analysis. The local genetic databases play a crucial role in providing essential species and population validation. The involvement of both wild and domestic species in each case necessitates an efficient, accurate, rapid, and cost-effective protocol to differentiate wild from domestic species among exhibits seized at crime scenes and to confirm the identity of wild species beyond any doubt.

AB  - Early-life stages of canopy-forming macroalgae are critical for the maintenance of natural populations and the success of restoration actions. Unfortunately, the abiotic conditions and biotic interactions shaping the success of these stages have received less attention than the interactions shaping the success of adults. Here, we combined field and mesocosm experiments to explore the effects of temperature, herbivory, and canopy presence on the development of early-life stages of the brown seaweed Cystoseira foeniculacea. We assessed these effects by examining changes in recruit density and size. After recruiting zygotes under laboratory conditions, we conducted one laboratory and three field experiments. In the first field experiment, the density of recruits decreased over time in all rockpools and was negatively affected by rising temperatures and turf cover. Additionally, a marine heatwave (MHW; 11 days >25 degrees C) was recorded in the donor pools, producing strong decay in the density of transplanted recruits and a significant reduction of the mature canopy. The second field experiment tested the survival of recruits based on their positioning within the canopy. We observed a higher density of recruits when placed at the edge or outside the canopy compared to recruits placed under the canopy. In the third field experiment, an herbivory-exclusion experiment, we show how density of recruits decreased in less than 48 h in noncaged treatments. In the laboratory, we conducted a thermotolerance experiment under controlled conditions, exposing the recruits to 19, 22, 25, 28, and 31 degrees C for 7 weeks to assess thermal impacts on their survival and growth. Temperatures above the 25 degrees C threshold reduced the density and size of the recruits. This study sheds light on the performance of the early-life stages of a Cystoseira spp. in Macaronesia, showing a low survival ratio against the current pressures even in the context of the potential refuge provided by the intertidal rockpools.

AB  - Human development and induced activities significantly affect the natural functioning of ecosystems and hence landscape connectivity. Ecological corridors are essential for maintaining structural as well as functional connectivity in cultural landscapes for wildlife, while providing interchange between core areas. In two pilot areas in the north-western and eastern part of Austria, ecological corridors were delineated using a geographic information system (GIS). The pilot areas are key to preserving ecological connectivity and are located along important international migration corridors (Bohemian Forest-Northern Alps corridor, Alpine-Carpathian corridor). Both areas are situated in highly human-altered and therefore dissected as well as fragmented landscapes. A one-year monitoring campaign using camera traps was carried out at selected locations along proposed ecological corridors in the cultural landscape and at wildlife crossings structures (WCSs) at intersections with road infrastructure. The monitoring was focused on mammals with a total of 18 species being observed. The most abundant species were roe deer, European hare and wild boar. European otter, European beaver, golden jackal and wildcat have only rarely been observed. Mammal species richness was positively correlated with the presence of vegetation cover and the coefficient of ecological stability (CES). The insights obtained can be used for recommendations and support in planning the planting of vegetation (use of grasslands, scattered and continuous woody vegetation, agroforestry systems) on the sites and in the vicinity of ecological corridors. The green bridges (wildlife overpasses) were used more frequently as well as by a larger number of mammal species compared to other studied WCSs showing characteristics that are less favourable for animals. The effectiveness of WCSs is mainly influenced by human activities, resulting in the recommendation to limit them on WCSs located along the routes of ecological corridors. We point out that actual wildlife migration corridors are likely to differ from designated data-driven ecological corridors generated by spatially explicit models, because these generally do not take into account all factors relating to the effectiveness of corridors. Our results suggest, that the application of the concept of functional connectivity is able to enhance the quality of ecological corridor designations, since usually they are based only on the concept of structural connectivity. For this reason, further studies are needed to help understanding factors and their specificities influencing the interplay between structural and functional connectivity of ecological corridors.

AB  - Biological invasions pose a threat to nearly every ecosystem worldwide.(1,2) Although eradication programs can successfully eliminate invasive species and enhance native biodiversity, especially on islands,(3) the effects of eradication on cross-ecosystem processes are unknown. On islands where rats were never introduced, seabirds transfer nutrients from pelagic to terrestrial and nearshore marine habitats, which in turn enhance the productivity, biomass, and functioning of recipient ecosystems.(4-6) Here, we test whether rat eradication restores seabird populations, their nutrient subsidies, and some of their associated benefits for ecosystem function to tropical islands and adjacent coral reefs. By comparing islands with different rat invasion histories, we found a clear hierarchy whereby seabird biomass, seabird-driven nitrogen inputs, and the incorporation of seabird-derived nutrients into terrestrial and marine food chains were highest on islands where rats were never introduced, intermediate on islands where rats were eradicated 4-16 years earlier, and lowest on islands with invasive rats still present. Seabird-derived nutrients diminished from land to sea and with increasing distance to rat-eradicated islands, but extended at least 300 m from shore. Although rat eradication enhanced seabird-derived nutrients in soil, leaves, marine algae, and herbivorous reef fish, reef fish growth was similar around rat-eradicated and rat-infested islands. Given that the loss of nutrient subsidies is of global concern,7 that removal of invasive species restores previously lost nutrient pathways over relatively short timescales is promising. However, the full return of cross-ecosystem nutrient subsidies and all of their associated demographic benefits may take multiple decades.

AB  - Remote sensing provides multi-dimensional and multi-temporal information about habitat, insights into the significant drivers of change, and the key factors affecting landscape dynamics. Such information is crucial to provide perspective and a more profound understanding of ecological surveys. This study utilizes Google Earth Engine's capability to assess a riverine wetland grassland floodplain in Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary (HWS) along the Ganga River, which is a critical habitat for wintering migratory birds, the critically endangered gharial, turtles, aquatic mammals such as otters and dolphins, and cervid species such as swamp deer. We have developed a framework for regular monitoring through rapid habitat assessment, which visualizes the spatio-temporal change in land cover, the seasonal dynamics in water and vegetation, changes due to anthropogenic in-fluences on the landscape, and finally, how these factors affect the habitat availability of species of concern in the HWS. The results show a dynamic river system with high seasonal variations. The vegetation trend shows increasing greenness, indicative of the conversion of grassland, scrubland, and herbaceous cover to more per-manent vegetation, which will adversely affect the riparian habitat structure. A habitat suitability index generated through geospatial analysis using the weighted overlay method suggests that 40.07% of the HWS, nearly 767.12 km2, comprising mainly the riverscape, wetland, and riparian grasslands, is suitable habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic species. However, only 9.93% of the sanctuary comprising 197.27 km2, is available as a core habitat. Further, the area is threatened by encroachment evident from the rapidly increasing land-use in-tensity and night light pollution, which puts the grasslands sheltered to swamp deer and other wildlife at higher risk leaving almost 27.9% of the area comprising 533.63 km2 unsuitable for wildlife. Urban and agricultural land use has taken over 67% of the sanctuary. An increase in minimum radiance value representing ALAN, from 0.41 to 0.73 W/m2-sr in just six years from 2015 to 2021, shows a reduction in nocturnal darkness, reducing safe niches for wildlife. The study results provide critical baseline information for ecological surveys and a rapid assessment platform for future sanctuary management. Constant monitoring of anthropogenic activities such as farming, settlements, and transport routes threatening the habitat is essential for informed conservation man-agement decisions.

AB  - Wildlife exclusion fencing has become a standard component of highway mitigation systems designed to reduce collisions with large mammals. Past work on the effectiveness of exclusion fencing has relied heavily on control-impact (i.e., space-for-time substitutions) and before-after study designs. These designs limit inference and may confound the effectiveness of mitigation with co-occurring process that also changes the rate of collisions. We used a replicated (n = 2 sites monitored for over 1000 km years combined) before-after-control-impact study design to assess fencing effectiveness along the Trans-Canada Highway in the Rocky Mountains of Canada. We found that collisions declined for common ungulates species (elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer) by up to 96% but not for large carnivores. The weak response of carnivores is likely due to the combination of fence intrusions and low sample sizes. We calculated realized fencing effectiveness by applying the same change in collision rates observed at control (unfenced) sites as the expected change for adjacent fenced sections. Compared with the apparent fencing effectiveness (i.e., the difference in WVCs rates before and after fencing was installed), the realized estimates of fencing effectiveness declined by 6% at one site and increased by 10% at another site. When factoring in the cost of ungulate collisions to society, fencing provided a net economic gain within 1 year of construction. Over a 10-year period, fencing would provide a net economic gain of > $500,000 per km in reduced collisions. Our study highlights the benefits of long-term monitoring of road mitigation projects and provides evidence of fencing effectiveness for reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions involving large mammals.

AB  - Context Human activities, such as tourism and hunting, affect the spatiotemporal behaviour of wildlife. For example, it is well documented that ungulates change their spatiotemporal behaviour as a response to hunting pressure, but less is known about ungulate responses to hunting in areas where human activity is common throughout the year and ungulates are constrained by fences.Aims In this camera-trap study, we analysed the change in spatiotemporal behaviour of wild ungulates (elk, Cervus canadensis (3519 events), moose, Alces alces (1153 events), and white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus (2708 events)) in response to the hunting period in a recreational and fenced park, the Cooking Lake-Blackfoot Provincial Area, Canada.Methods We used general linear models to compare species-specific patterns of intensity of use, calculated as events per week, in response to changes in the nature of human disturbance, namely a shift from recreation to hunting activity. In particular, we compared intensity of use in and out of the hunting season to determine whether species engaged in spatial patterns of avoidance with respect to hunting. We used daily and seasonal patterns of activity to determine how ungulates shifted their temporal use in response to hunting activity and whether they became more nocturnal as a result.Key results We found that ungulates responded temporally to the hunting period by generally shifting their activity to more nocturnal hours, with white-tailed deer showing the biggest temporal shift, suggesting that the ungulates distinguish between consumptive and non-consumptive human activities. Nevertheless, temporal overlap between humans and all ungulate species increased during the hunting period as humans targeted times of increased ungulate activity. Spatially, the response was less distinctive and was species-specific. Elk showed little change in spatial behaviour in response to the hunting period. In contrast, moose decreased the use of trail areas and other areas frequented by humans, whereas deer, counterintuitively, increased the use of trail areas, albeit their use became much more nocturnal.Conclusions We have shown that responses of ungulates to hunting exceed those to non-consumptive recreational use, and whereas temporal responses (increased nocturnality) were consistent across ungulate species, spatial responses were species-specific.Implications Management in small fenced multi-use areas needs to account for shifts in the intensity of disturbance resulting from a change in human disturbance from recreational activity to hunting. Providing spatial opportunities for avoidance of humans is key for most species if hours of operation in these areas already limit the timing of human activity.
   Human use, including recreation and hunting, can disturb wildlife and this can be particularly problematic in fenced multi-use landscapes. This study aimed to investigate how human use, which switched from recreation-based disturbance to hunting, changed the patterns of use by native ungulates in space and time and we found consistent patterns of temporal avoidance, whereas patterns of spatial avoidance were species-specific. We make recommendations for how to minimise human impacts in multi-use recreational landscapes. Image by Darcy Visscher.

AB  - The use of scent for communication is widespread in mammals, yet the role of scent-marking in the social system of many species is poorly understood. Nilgai antelope (Boselaphus tragocamelus) are native to India, Nepal, and Pakistan. They were introduced to Texas rangelands in the United States during the 1920s to 1940s, and have since expanded into much of coastal South Texas and northern Mexico. The nilgai social system includes the use of latrines or repeated defecation at a localized site. We quantified and described physical and behavioral characteristics of nilgai latrine ecology to investigate drivers of latrine use at three sites in South Texas, during April 2018 to March 2019. Latrines were abundant (2.6-8.7 latrines/ha on unpaved roads, 0.4-0.9 latrines/ha off-roads), with no evidence for selection as to vegetation communities; latrines were dynamic in persistence and visitation rates. We found higher densities of latrines in Spring surveys, just after the peak of nilgai breeding activity, compared to Autumn surveys. Density of nilgai latrines was 3-10 times greater than estimated population densities, indicating individual nilgai must use multiple latrines. Camera traps and fecal DNA analysis revealed latrines were mainly (70%) visited by bulls and defecated on by bulls (92% in photos, 89% for DNA samples). The greatest frequency of visits occurred during the peak in the nilgai breeding season, from December-February; latrines were visited every 2-3 days on average. Body characteristics of photographed individuals and genetic analysis of feces indicated repeated visits from the same individuals. Nilgai cows occasionally used latrines; their use was sometimes followed by bulls showing flehmen responses after a female defecated or urinated on the latrine. We propose that dominant bulls use latrines for territory demarcation to display social dominance to both cows in estrus and subordinate bulls. Cows likely use latrines to communicate reproductive status. This study is the first intensive assessment focused on latrine ecology in nilgai. Our results directly contradict anecdotal descriptions of latrine use and behavior in nilgai but are consistent with predictions of antelope social systems based on body size, feeding type, and group dynamics.

AB  - Context The Indian bison or gaur (Bos gaurus gaurus), one of the three extant subspecies, was once widely distributed. Gaur populations have significantly declined throughout India owing to poaching and other human pressures. The reintroduction of individuals is a standard tool for restoring a species population. The gaur population was declared locally extinct in the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve (BTR), central India, in 1998. Therefore, the Indian Government decided to rebuild its population by translocating individuals from the Kanha Tiger Reserve (KTR) in central India. Genetics has been an integral part of ensuring population viability for a species; however, there is a lack of studies on wild gaur of KTR and the implications for translocations.Aim We investigated the utility of bovine microsatellites for the genetic assessment of reintroduced gaur population in KTR.Methods We used blood samples from 19 gaur individuals belonging to two subpopulations within the core area of the KTR, which were collected under the gaur reintroduction plan to the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve (BTR) in central India.Key results We observed moderate genetic diversity (Ho = 0.58), a large proportion of unrelated individuals (71-78%), a lack of population structuring, no indication of inbreeding. This suggests the existence of non-random mating and the presence of connectivity between the two subpopulations.Conclusions Our results suggest the presence of a panmictic gaur gene pool because of their ability to disperse across subpopulations through the undisturbed, inviolate, high-quality habitat of the core area of the KTR.Implications The study has the following observation implications (i) regular monitoring of the habitat connectivity of the gaur to ensure nonrandom mating in KTR, (ii) retaining the founder genetic diversity considering the baseline genetic characteristics data of the reintroduced population of BTR, and (iii) use of optimized and harmonized bovid microsatellites to assess the population genetic structure of gaur across different geographical regions in the country using comparable data for augmentation of BTR population in future.

AB  - The Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem is highly productive, with large populations of commercially and ecologically important species including Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, Ad & eacute;lie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae, and crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophagus. The ecology of the peninsula is rapidly changing due to accelerating climate change and fishing pressure. Systematic ecosystem surveys have focused on austral spring and summer, leaving an information gap on winter ecosystem dynamics. Using data from 5 consecutive ecosystem surveys, we quantified the composition and distribution of winter predator communities and investigated the physical and biological influences on community structure. Seabirds and marine mammals clustered into 3 communities: an ice-associated community represented by Ad & eacute;lie penguins and crabeater seals; a diverse marginal ice zone community dominated by fur seals and several species of seabirds including 3 petrels, kelp gulls Larus dominicanus, and Antarctic terns Sterna vittata; and an open water community consisting of southern fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides and 4 species of petrels. These communities were distributed along an environmental gradient ranging from ice-covered, cold, saline water to ice-free, warmer, and fresher water with greater chlorophyll concentrations. Predator communities were also associated with different communities of macrozooplankton: ice-associated predators with an extremely diverse assemblage of typically mesopelagic zooplankton; marginal ice zone predators with a community of large-bodied euphausiids (E. superba, E. crystallorophias); and open water predators with a community of small-bodied euphausiids (Thysanoessa macrura). Our synthesis of integrated winter predator and macrozooplankton communities relative to sea-ice concentration provides reference points for future ecosystem assessments within this rapidly changing region.

AB  - In the face of climate change, wind energy represents an important alternative to oil and gas extraction to meet increasing energy demands, but it has the potential to disrupt wildlife populations. Because behavioral adjustments, such as altered habitat selection, are a primary way that long-lived species respond to novel disturbances, we evaluated effects of wind energy development on pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) space use and habitat selection. Using data from GPS-collared female pronghorn in the Shirley Basin of south-central Wyoming, USA, we tested four potential effects of wind turbines on pronghorn space use during the summer and winter: (1) displacement away from wind turbines, (2) increase in size of home ranges, (3) short-term avoidance behavior within home ranges, and (4) changes in avoidance behavior within home ranges over time. We monitored 166 individuals over five summers (2010, 2011, 2018, 2019, and 2020) and 142 individuals over five winters (2009/2010, 2010/2011, 2011/2012, 2018/2019, and 2019/2020) and used resource selection functions to evaluate selection relative to turbines after controlling for other habitat factors, such as snow depth. Although a lack of consistent negative effects of wind turbines on pronghorn across years suggested that wind energy development may have less severe and more intermittent effects on pronghorn than oil and gas development has had on other ungulates, there was a trend toward increased displacement during the study and behavioral avoidance was apparent for individuals in close proximity to turbines. However, pronghorn were highly variable in their fine-scale habitat selection, across both individuals and years, which could make effects of wind energy development difficult to detect. Nevertheless, some individuals, particularly those close to wind-energy facilities, did avoid turbines, which could translate to population-level behavioral or demographic changes over time and affect the resilience and stability of the population. Over time, the accumulation of development, including wind turbines, roads, and fences, can both limit movement and fragment habitat, potentially reaching a critical threshold beyond which populations are negatively impacted.

AB  - Context. Deer species are expanding in distribution and abundance in Australia. There is increasing focus on the ecology of these species, but effective deer capture methods are needed for telemetry studies.Aims The aims of this study were to develop, assess and refine a helicopter-based capture technique for wild sambar deer (Rusa unicolor) and red deer (Cervus elaphus), based on trials in south-eastern Australia. Methods. We captured and collared 14 sambar deer and five red deer in two operations in Kosciuszko National Park in 2021, using a combination of aerial net gunning and chemical immobilisation delivered via hand injection. Captured animals were fitted with GPS collars to track their movements and activity post-capture. Physiological measurements were recorded as a means of assessing responses to capture and to optimise animal welfare outcomes. Key results. Twenty-two deer were pursued and captured, with a total mortality rate of 14% (n = 3). The frequency of mortalities decreased from the first operation (17%) to the second operation (10%), largely attributed to allowable helicopter pursuit times being reduced. Post-release movement data indicated that delayed mortality due to capture did not occur. Activity of collared deer was lowest immediately following collaring, suggesting the procedure caused short-term decreases in deer activity. Conclusions. Aerial capture of wild sambar deer and red deer poses animal welfare risks, but these can be minimised through the refinement in net gunning and pharmacological procedures to minimise animal stress. Implications. This study describes an effective method for the safe capture of sambar deer and red deer, which will assist future wildlife researchers to further refine helicopter-based capture protocols and to collect spatial ecology and survival information about these species.

AB  - The UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration signifies the ambition to move beyond a defensive focus on biodiversity protection towards a proactive agenda of restoring ecosystems to generate value for people and nature. The international nature regime, based on the linked concepts of biodiversity and sustainable development, has achieved much. However, its institutions are built on a 'compositional' approach to ecology that 'locks in' arbitrary ecological baselines and constrains an ambitious approach to ecosystem restoration. Rewilding and the wider field of restoration ecology foreground the dynamic nature of ecosystems, the need to consider system function and the importance of trophic networks for ecosystem recovery. Rewilding science extends these new directions with a focus on restoring the functional effects of large megafauna and random biotic and abiotic disturbance. I argue that historic processes of institutional reductionism, which enabled the construction of a strong protective biodiversity regime, have created institutions that lack the flexibility and innovation culture needed to create new policy and practice to support the recovery of ecosystem integrity and open-ended restoration processes such as rewilding. Given this, we need to initiate ordered and effective processes of institutional redesign. To this end, I have proposed five actions for discussion, namely: (a) adopt and embed a positive, hopeful and empowering narrative of nature recovery; (b) create 'nature recovery innovation zones', where existing policy and regulations are relaxed and new approaches are developed and tested; (c) develop functional classifications of nature to support the design of 'new generation' policy instruments; (d) create markets for ecosystem recovery based on units of ecosystem change to support the emergence of a nature recovery land economy; and (e) introduce programs of professional training in the science, principles and opportunities of ecosystem recovery at all levels in government and non-government conservation agencies. The world of 2050 will be very different from that of today. We have extremely well-educated and skilled younger generations, with the motivation and ability to redesign nature institutions. It is time to act and empower them. Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - The ecological impacts of invasive mammals are widely documented around the world. In New Zealand, fencing designed to exclude non-native mammals is used for conservation and restoration efforts. The Orokonui Ecosanctuary is a 307-hectare coastal Otago reserve (Dunedin, New Zealand) that is surrounded by mammal-exclusion fencing. The goal of the present study was to investigate how excluding mammals and including (native) animals inside the Orokonui Ecosanctuary fence has influenced ground- and litter-dwelling beetle (Coleoptera) abundance, diversity, and community composition. We hypothesised that beetle abundance, diversity, and community composition would be different whether the beetles sampled were from sites inside the fence or outside the fence. Beetles were extracted from the litter and soil of six sites (three inside, three outside) two times (once in winter, once in summer). The abundance, diversity, species composition, size distribution, and trophic guild distribution of beetles inside and outside the fence and between seasons were compared. Our results suggest that sites inside the fence harbour a greater abundance and diversity of beetles. We found a high abundance of native beetles both inside and outside the Orokonui Ecosanctuary's fence. Further research may find evidence that the fenced sanctuary is providing a 'halo effect' whereby native beetles thriving within the Orokonui Ecosanctuary are spreading out into the surrounding landscape and also outcompeting introduced beetles.

AB  - This study aims to survey mammal diversity on Ko Pha-ngan, located 80 km off the east peninsular coast of Surat Thani province, Thailand. Thirteen camera trap sites, 32 transects, six drift line fence traps, five mist net trap sites, and nine live trap sites placed in human settlement, human-disturbed forest, and national park forest from February 2021 to September 2023 were utilized. A total of 28 mammal species of eight orders, 17 families, and 21 genera were found. Among them, 11 species are flying mammals while the remaining are terrestrial. Of the species detected, Manis javanica (pangolin) is critically endangered, while Nycticebus coucang (slow loris monkey) is endange by IUCN Red List. Additionally, Rusa unicolor (sambar deer) is vulnerable and Pteropus cf. hypomelanus (island flying fox), Trachypithecus obscurus (dusky leaf monkey), and Ratufa bicolor (giant black squirrel) are near threatened. These findings highlight the need to conserve and protect both national park forest and human-disturbed forest from anthropogenic pressures due to the finite area of an island, in which potential local extinction risk is higher.

AB  - . The Island of Santa Catarina is the largest island on the Brazilian coast. Within the Atlantic Forest domain, it serves as a model for investigating the decline in biodiversity within this ecosystem. This decline is associated with the loss of a large part of forest cover and mammalian species. Although the forest environment in the island has recovered more in comparison to the rest of the Atlantic Rainforest (66% versus 28%, respectively), the isolation typical of islands has hindered the recolonization of sensitive species, particularly those that are threatened. Two decades after the first publication of the mammal list of the Island of Santa Catarina, we revised past data to identify which species became extinct and which native and exotic species remain, focusing on the inclusion of Chiroptera. Through bibliographical reviews, scientific collections and field surveys, a total of 59 species of native mammals, non-volant and volants, were confirmed. Among these, eight species were determined to be extirpated, all threatened with extinction, including large ungulates and top cats, in addition to the occurrence of nine domestic and exotic invasive species. Studies employing specific methodologies and sampling techniques in inadequately assessed environments have the potential to augment species richness, particularly among rodents, marsupials, and bats.

AB  - The Central Highlands region of Madagascar is currently dominated by open and mosaic ecosystems, and the region is targeted for afforestation projects. At present, little is known about the origin of these ecosystems and whether or not they are ancient or anthropogenically derived mosaics. This paper provides new insights into the environmental history and drivers of change in the Central Highlands of Madagascar during the last 6300 years through palaeoecological records from Lake Dangovavy. Our results suggested that open and mosaic ecosystems have been present in the landscape for at least 6000 years that is, 4 cal. ka BP before human settlement (2 cal. ka BP). Between 6.3 and 2 cal. ka BP landscapes were characterized by a mosaic ecosystem dominated by a matrix of open montane grassland and ericoid shrubland with extent forest patches, associated with seasonal variation of rainfall, and fire. A matrix of ericoid shrubland remained abundant in the landscape despite an increase of fire regime and herbivory activities between 2 and 1.1 cal. ka BP. Major changes in the vegetation were recorded during the last millennium with a shift towards a more open C4-dominated grassland associated with high fire frequency and herbivory activities, most likely linked to human influence. Our findings support the notion of the natural presence of open ecosystems on the islands. These shed light on the landscape history which should be considered when setting conservation goals with a particular focus on areas targeted for tree plantations and fire bans like the Central highlands of Madagascar.

AB  - The introduction of non-native species into new environments can cause significant ecological harm and is considered a major conservation threat. As populations of invasive species continue to establish and increase across the globe, novel methods can provide new insights into their biology and potentially aid in management. In this study, we examined the diet of non-native chital deer (Axis axis) in a tropical savanna environment in northern Australia. Using DNA metabarcoding of fecal samples, we described the dietary items consumed by 149 individuals over a two-year sampling period and associated each item with individual body condition. The DNA metabarcoding method detected significantly more dietary items consumed by individual chital deer at each of the taxonomic levels (family, genus, and species) when compared with previous analyses. We observed marked differences in diet composition across multiple seasons and sites. Significantly more sequences from the genera Terminalia, Diospyros, Jasminum, and Hakea were detected in samples collected from individuals in poor condition during the dry season, suggesting that a different suite of food resources is being consumed by a subset of individuals during periods when forage quantity and quality is low. Most notably, our results indicated that chital are consuming a browse-dominated diet throughout the year, differing from previous macroscopy analyses which suggested chital are predominantly grazers during the wet season in northern Australia. Our findings give support for the use of DNA metabarcoding to qualitatively assess diet composition compared to macroscopic analysis and suggest that the restricted availability of food during the dry season may result in the consumption of poor quality and detrimental dietary items.

AB  - 1. Charophytes are a key group of submerged macrophytes in temperate hardwater lakes, but have declined or been replaced by angiosperms as a result of eutrophication for more than 100 years. At present, this process is continuing in many European lakes despite an overall reduced nutrient loading. In eutrophic lakes, light attenuation by periphyton is a major factor responsible for declining angiosperm abundance. For charophyte declines, the impact of benthivorous and herbivorous fish has been discussed often, yet periphyton shading has been largely neglected.
   2. In our study, we investigated 11 temperate oligo-mesotrophic (total phosphorus [P] concentrations 9-22 mu g/L) hardwater lakes along a gradient of charophyte abundances. Charophyte abundance was mapped using underwater cameras or scuba diving, and coverage was estimated in five classes. Periphyton biomass, nutrient stoichiometry and invertebrate grazer abundance were measured twice on artificial substrates exposed inside and outside fish exclosures for 4 weeks in July and August. Fish biomass was sampled once using multi-mesh gill netting.
   3. We analysed the relationships between water chemistry (concentrations of nutrients and dissolved organic carbon), periphyton biomass and nutrient stoichiometry, periphytic invertebrate grazers and fish biomass to test (a) whether periphyton biomass was controlled bottom-up by nutrient availability or top-down by an omnivorous fish-invertebrate-grazer cascade and (b) whether charophyte abundance was affected by periphyton biomass, benthivorous and herbivorous fish.
   4. Multiple linear regressions revealed that charophyte abundance was significantly predicted by the biomasses of periphyton and benthivorous bream (Abramis brama L.), whereas herbivorous rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus L.) had no significant effect in the investigated lakes. Bream biomass and its proportion in the total fish biomass were linearly related to lake total P concentrations.
   5. Periphyton biomass in the tested lakes reached 0.1-21 g dry weight/m(2) and primarily was controlled bottom-up by P availability as indicated from stoichiometry and positive correlations with grazer abundance. Top-down control was found in only three lakes, which had significantly lower periphyton biomass inside fish exclosures as compared to controls.
   6. Our data imply that periphyton shading and negative fish impacts on charophytes increase with P loading. Low charophyte abundances at moderate P concentrations in the lake water indicate a high sensitivity of charophytes and/or unnoticed nutrient loading due to nutrient retention by charophyte stands. Management measures thus must focus on reducing nutrient loading and/or benthivorous fish biomass at early stages of impact to preserve charophyte stands in oligo-mesotrophic hardwater lakes.

AB  - In the long-term absence of disturbance, ecosystems often enter a decline or retrogressive phase which leads to reductions in primary productivity, plant biomass, nutrient cycling and foliar quality. However, the consequences of ecosystem retrogression for higher trophic levels such as herbivores and predators, are less clear. Using a post-fire forested island-chronosequence across which retrogression occurs, we provide evidence that nutrient availability strongly controls invertebrate herbivore biomass when predators are few, but that there is a switch from bottom-up to top-down control when predators are common. This trophic flip in herbivore control probably arises because invertebrate predators respond to alternative energy channels from the adjacent aquatic matrix, which were independent of terrestrial plant biomass. Our results suggest that effects of nutrient limitation resulting from ecosystem retrogression on trophic cascades are modified by nutrient-independent variation in predator abundance, and this calls for a more holistic approach to trophic ecology to better understand herbivore effects on plant communities.

AB  - The diversity of dragonflies on an island is strongly influenced by habitat degradation, as well as the size and distance from the mainland. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the species diversity of dragonflies in the Sangihe Islands, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. It was carried out in five types of habitats namely forests, waterfalls, dams, agricultural land, and settlements. In each habitat, four-line transects with a length of 100 m each were made and placed around the river. The results showed 6 families which included 32 species and 3020 individuals. Libellulidae is the family with the highest number of species. Furthermore, the dominant species in the suborders Anisoptera and Zygoptera were Orthetrum pruinosum and Rhinocypha frontalis , respectively. Forests, waterfalls, and dams tend to have the highest species richness and diversity index compared to other habitats. Based on the results, the diversity of dragonflies at the observation site is strongly influenced by the complexity of the vegetation and environmental factors, including temperature and humidity. The presence of the families Chlorocyphidae, Calopterygidae, and Platycnemididae in each of the studied habitats indicates that the water quality is still very good and supports the life of dragonflies.

AB  - Determining how climate affects biotic interactions can improve understanding of drivers of context-dependence and inform predictions of how interactions may influence plants under future climates. In arid environments, the community-level impacts of seed predators may depend strongly on aridity; yet, long-term studies documenting impacts of granivores on plant communities over variable climate conditions remain scarce. We evaluated how rodent exclusion interacted with climate to influence grassland and shrubland forb communities and the community-scale distribution of seed mass over 15 years in the climatically variable northern Chihuahuan Desert. In this dynamic system, two seasonally distinct plant community phases occur annually, one in spring and the other during the summer monsoon. Rodent exclusion significantly altered the community composition of monsoon season plant communities in both grassland and shrubland, but did not affect spring plant composition. Rodents suppressed the abundance of larger-seeded forb species and promoted smaller-seeded species. As a consequence, rodent exclusion increased community seed mass (CWM) in monsoon forb communities, most strongly in grassland. The magnitude of impacts of rodents on seed mass varied substantially from year-to-year, tracking variation in climate. Specifically, rodent exclusion increased community mean seed mass the most in dry years (grassland) or in years following dry years (shrubland). Rodent exclusion had relatively weak effects on plant species diversity and richness. Our results indicate that climate interacts with the presence of rodents to structure not only the composition but also the traits of desert plant communities.

AB  - Alpine grasslands are sensitive to grazing and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. Despite increases in N deposition, few field studies have assessed the effects of grazing in conjunction with increased N deposition on alpine grassland vegetation. In this two-year field study, we examined the effects of overgrazing and overgrazing plus N deposition on ecophysiological processes of alpine grassland plants at the functional group level. We found that both overgrazing and overgrazing plus N deposition altered species composition and the dominance of three plant functional groups (grasses, sedges, and forbs) in an alpine meadow and alpine steppe. In the overgrazing and overgrazing plus N deposition treatments, forbs dominated the plant community. Grass and sedge dominance decreased substantially, relative to a ungrazed treatment. The underlying eco-physiological processes that led to the forb-dominated plant community differed between the overgrazing and overgrazing plus N deposition treatments. Overgrazing plus N deposition increased forb dominance both directly by selective herbivory and indirectly by enhancing forb photosynthetic rates. Our results suggest that overgrazing concomitant with increases in N deposition will likely shift the plant community composition of alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from grass/sedge communities to forb-dominated communities in the future.

AB  - Traffic mortality can pose a serious risk to endangered species that occur in small populations, are mobile and occupy fragmented habitats. This is the case for the European bison (Bison bonasus) yet, how traffic mortality affects this species is unknown. Here, we assessed patterns and trends of European bison mortality on roads and railways in Poland, which harbors a large share of the global free-ranging population of this species. We identified 70 records of European bison mortality due to roads or railways during 2010-2021, which involved three free-ranging populations: Bialowieska Forest, Knyszy ' nska Forest, and Zachodniopomorskie. Most reported mortality (73%) was from the Zachodniopomorskie population, likely an effect of the high traffic volumes on a national road passing through the core range of that population. Furthermore, our analysis revealed an increasing trend of European bison traffic fatalities, which is likely associated with increasing European bison numbers in these populations. We conclude that traffic accidents may pose a risk to both European bison and people, and reintroductions should therefore prioritize roadless areas and avoid areas with busy roads and railways. Although traffic mortality of European bison has been a negligible threat to the species as a whole, our study shows that this threat may be substantial locally. As European bison numbers grow, which is desirable given the still small size of many free-ranging populations, effective mitigation measures are needed to ensure the safety of European bison and people.

AB  - Invasive species management practices often include genetic analyses to better inform decision-making and resource allocation. Yet, past management actions may artificially bias recovered patterns of genetic variation; for example a population bottleneck caused by contemporary culling may mirror some patterns associated with historical isolation. Here, we aimed to disentangle the impacts of past management activities from natural processes for Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis), an invasive species that has been repeatedly culled on two islands, SGang Gwaay and Reef, within the Haida Gwaii archipelago (Canada). We applied a recently developed Genotyping-in-Thousands by sequencing panel to contemporary (e.g., blood, serum, tissue, muscle, feces) and archived deer samples, the latter collected prior to management activity within the system (c. 1997-1998), which allowed us to contextualize conflicting patterns of isolation and connectivity previously observed on SGang Gwaay and Reef. Successful genotyping (92.6%) and population genetic analysis of 292 individuals at 236 SNPs revealed signals of historical isolation on SGang Gwaay and Reef, provided evidence of a founder effect during initial colonization, and indicated an absence of ongoing gene flow. Furthermore, our spatiotemporal analyses consistently supported a priori predictions associated with bottlenecks within post-cull populations, such as within-island loss of genetic variation, elevated within-island kinship, and increased levels of among-island genetic differentiation. These findings are promising for future management of deer on SGang Gwaay and Reef, suggesting that eradications on these islands may be durable. More broadly, our work highlights the importance of understanding management history when interpreting contemporary population genetic data.

AB  - Land-use intensification and climate change threaten ecosystem functions. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, function is decomposition of necromass. The direct and indirect anthropogenic effects on decomposition, however, are poorly understood. We measured decomposition of two contrasting types of necromass, rat carrion and bison dung, on 179 study sites in Central Europe across an elevational climate gradient of 168-1122 m a.s.l. and within both local and regional land uses. Local land-use types included forest, grassland, arable fields, and settlements and were embedded in three regional land-use types (near-natural, agricultural, and urban). The effects of insects on decomposition were quantified by experimental exclusion, while controlling for removal by vertebrates. We used generalized additive mixed models to evaluate dung weight loss and carrion decay rate along elevation and across regional and local land-use types. We observed a unimodal relationship of dung decomposition with elevation, where greatest weight loss occurred between 600 and 700 m, but no effects of local temperature, land use, or insects. In contrast to dung, carrion decomposition was continuously faster with both increasing elevation and local temperature. Carrion reached the final decomposition stage six days earlier when insect access was allowed, and this did not depend on land-use effect. Our experiment identified different major drivers of decomposition on each necromass form. The results show that dung and carrion decomposition are rather robust to local and regional land use, but future climate change and decline of insects could alter decomposition processes and the self-regulation of ecosystems.

AB  - Despite a long presence in the contiguous United States (US), the distribution of invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa x domesticus) has expanded rapidly since the 1980s, suggesting a more recent evolutionary shift towards greater invasiveness. Contemporary populations of wild pigs represent exoferal hybrid descendants of domestic pigs and European wild boar, with such hybridization expected to enrich genetic diversity and increase the adaptive potential of populations. Our objective was to characterize how genetic enrichment through hybridization increases the invasiveness of populations by identifying signals of selection and the ancestral origins of selected loci. Our study focused on invasive wild pigs within Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which represents a hybrid population descendent from the admixture of established populations of feral pigs and an introduction of European wild boar to North America. Accordingly, we genotyped 881 wild pigs with multiple high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. We found 233 markers under putative selection spread over 79 regions across 16 out of 18 autosomes, which contained genes involved in traits affecting feralization. Among these, genes were found to be related to skull formation and neurogenesis, with two genes, TYRP1 and TYR, also encoding for crucial melanogenesis enzymes. The most common haplotypes associated with regions under selection for the Great Smoky Mountains population were also common among other populations throughout the region, indicating a key role of putatively selective variants in the fitness of invasive populations. Interestingly, many of these haplotypes were absent among European wild boar reference genotypes, indicating feralization through genetic adaptation.

AB  - We applied two recent approaches largely used in biological conservation: Threat Analysis (TAN) and Threat Reduction Assessments (TRAs), assessing the effectiveness of a project focused on two water-related bird species (common tern, Sterna hirundo and little tern, Sternula albifrons), commonly breeding in some wetlands of Italy. We used the IUCN standardized lexicon for the classification of threats, utilizing a panel of experts to assess a set of regime attributes (extent, severity and magnitude) of each human-induced disturbance. Our aims were: (i) through the TAN approach, to carry out an arrangement and quantification of the main threats acting on our focal species and select the priority ones; (ii) through the TRA approach, to test the effectiveness of an operational project focused on mitigating the threats and improving the breeding success of species (i.e., building rafts and floating islands to encourage their nesting). Using the TAN approach, experts identified the following human-induced threats (IUCN code): 6.1-Generic disturbance; 7.2-Water stress; 7.3-Salinization; 8.8-Vagrant dogs; 8.8-Mediterranean gulls; 8.8-Wild boars, all significantly different in their magnitude. Among them, wild boars and Mediterranean gulls appeared the priority threats with the greatest extent, intensity and magnitude. Using the TRA approach, after the project, we assessed an overall decrease in the threat magnitude of 23.08% (21.42% when considering only the threats directly affected by our project). These data suggest that further efforts should be devoted to achieving greater effectiveness of conservation actions focused on our target species. With limited time and resources to quantify threats, expert-based approaches could be useful for rapidly assessing the effectiveness of small conservation projects by providing a range of scores obtained following an analytical procedure. In this regard, Threat Analysis and Threat Reduction Assessment could be considered useful tools to support adaptive management in project management cycles.

AB  - Marine megafauna serve valuable ecological and economical roles globally, yet, many species have experienced precipitous population declines. The significance of marine megafauna is particularly evident in Macaronesia, a complex of oceanic archipelagos in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. Macaronesian islands provide important habitats for marine megafauna species, in turn supporting considerable regional economic activity (e.g., ecotourism and fisheries). Despite this, concerted efforts to manage marine megafauna throughout Macaronesia have been limited. This systematic review provides the first description of the trends in marine megafauna research in this unique insular ecosystem, to provide a better understanding of taxa-specific research needs and future directions for conservation. We identified and validated 408 peer-reviewed publications until 2021 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. Literature was dominated by marine mammal research conducted in the northern archipelagos (Azores, Madeira, and Canary Islands) and marine turtle research conducted in Cabo Verde. Much less research focused on large-bodied fish, especially in Madeira and Canary Islands, leaving some of the most vulnerable species regionally data deficient. Research across scientific disciplines focused more on biological studies than management and policy, and anthropogenic impacts were quantified more frequently on mammals or turtles and less on fishes. By identifying gaps in our knowledge of megafauna in relation to threats faced by these organisms, we offer taxa-specific recommendations for future research direction. Although, overall our results indicate that determining population level connectivity should be a major research priority among many marine megafauna species as this information is vital to numerous management strategies, including marine protected areas. In this review, we present a basis of understanding of the current work in Macaronesia, highlighting critical data gaps that are urgently needed to guide the next steps toward establishing conservation priorities for marine megafauna in the region.

AB  - Context. Introduced populations of sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) and rusa deer (Cervus timorensis) are present across south-eastern Australia and are subject to local population control to alleviate their negative impacts. For management to be effective, identification of dispersal capability and management units is necessary. These species also readily hybridise, so additional investigation of hybridisation rates across their distributions is necessary to understand the interactions between the two species. Aims. Measure the hybridisation rate of sambar and rusa deer, assess broad-scale population structure present within both species and identify distinct management units for future population control, and measure the likely dispersal capability of both species. Methods. In total, 198 sambar deer, 189 rusa deer, and three suspected hybrid samples were collected across Victoria and New South Wales (NSW). After sequencing and filtering, 14 099 polymorphic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were retained for analysis. Hybridisation rates were assessed before the data were split by species to identify population structure, diversity indices, and dispersal distances. Key results. Across the entire dataset, 17 hybrids were detected. Broad-scale population structure was evident in sambar deer, but not among the sites where rusa deer were sampled. Analysis of dispersal ability showed that a majority of deer movement occurred within 20 km in both species, suggesting limited dispersal. Conclusions. Distinct management units of sambar deer can be identified from the dataset, allowing independent population control. Although broad-scale population structure was not evident in the rusa deer populations, dispersal limits identified suggest that rusa deer sites sampled in this study could be managed separately. Sambar x rusa deer hybrids are present in both Victoria and NSW and can be difficult to detect on the basis of morphology alone. Implications. Genetic analysis can identify broad-scale management units necessary for population control, and estimates of dispersal capability can assist in delineating management units where broad-scale population structure may not be apparent. The negative impacts associated with hybridisation require further investigation to determine whether removal of hybrids should be considered a priority management aim.

AB  - White-tailed deer can limit both growth and survival in slow-growing, shade-tolerant tree species. We monitored 1,100 juvenile hemlocks (Tsuga canadensis) for up to 20 years at 54 sites in northern Wisconsin and Michigan to document causes of recruitment failure. These sites include public and private forestlands and First Nation reservations with distinct approaches to forest and wildlife management. We assessed deer impacts experimentally by protecting half of the juveniles from deer and observationally by tracking unprotected individuals at sites with various deer densities. We estimated local deer and hare presence and density using repeated pellet counts, which best predicted the survival and growth of juvenile hemlocks. Caged individuals out-survived unprotected ones (35.2 vs. 15.0y estimated half-lives). For the fastest-growing quartiles, transition times through the "molar zone" of vulnerability to deer browse (heights 5-200 cm) were 33.4 and 77.7y for protected vs. unprotected juveniles. Deer browsing strongly reduces both survival and growth, allowing us to compare estimates of these processes and their ratio among sites and cohorts. The "Regeneration Ratio" of half-life to growth averaged 1.06 for the top quartile of protected hemlock juveniles vs. 0.19 for juveniles exposed to deer. Ratios below 1.0 suggest risks to hemlock regeneration while values below 0.50 signal likely failure. Forest and wildlife managers must limit deer impacts if hemlock trees and stands are to remain viable components of the region's forests.

AB  - Madagascar experienced environmental change during the Late-Holocene, and the relative importance of climatic and anthropogenic drivers is still the subject of an ongoing debate. Using palaeoecological records from the southwest region at Lake Longiza, we provide additional records to elucidate the complex history of the island and to identify the changes that occurred in the tropical dry forest during the Late-Holocene. The data showed vegetation changes associated with climate variability until AD 900 as reflected by the variation in grass, dry-adapted taxa, deciduous trees, and isotope records. An increasing effect of human activities was recorded, indicated by increased coprophilous spore concentration, as a result of a shift from foraging to pastoralism leading to further opening of the ecosystem from AD 980. At the same time, the regional palaeoclimate record showed drier conditions from around AD 1000, which could have accentuated the changes in vegetation structure. More open vegetation was likely maintained by increased use of fire and herbivory around the area, as indicated by the multiple peaks in the charcoal and spore records. Since AD 1900, the pollen record from the southwest region showed that the ecosystem became increasingly open with an increased abundance of grass, pioneer taxa, and reduced diversity, which was linked to a simultaneous effect of climate and agropastoralism activities. Our study suggests that the dry conditions around AD 950 initiated the replacement of forest-dominant vegetation with grass-dominant communities over the last millennium, depicted as an open ecosystem at present. Subsequent changes in subsistence activities would have further maintained an open-structured ecosystem.

AB  - Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) ecosystems in the southeastern U.S. are fire-driven. Frequent prescribed fire or lack thereof through shifts in fire regimes may have consequences for tree health and associated herbivorous subcortical beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Yet, interactions between these ecologically and economically important beetles and prescribed fire in the southeastern U.S. are not well documented. We assessed the effects of various fire regimes, specifically of frequent fire, fire exclusion, and fire reintroduction, on bark and root-feeding beetles in mature longleaf pine stands in two edaphic types (mesic and xeric) in southwestern Georgia. We employed an information theoretic statistical approach to determine the effects of site conditions, as defined by both soil properties and stand structure, and prescribed burning on trap catches of subcortical beetles by species. We trapped a total of 141,611 beetles, indicating that subcortical beetles are abundant in this ecosystem. While the highest trap catches for three Ips beetle species were in the xeric fire-exclusion treatment, catches of I. grandicollis (Eichhoff) were similar at both sites for the fire-exclusion treatment. For the fire-exclusion treatment, I. avulsus (Eichhoff) and I. calligraphus (Germar) catches were 2-10 times higher at the xeric than mesic sites. Orthotomicus caelatus (Eichhoff) and Dendroctonus terebrans (Olivier) catches were 1.1-2.4 times higher in frequent-fire than fire-exclusion treatments. Root-feeding weevils, Pachylobius picivorus (Germar) and Hylobius pales (Herbst), exhibited opposite trends with catches higher and lower in burned treatments, respectively. Ips calligraphus were positively associated with percent basal area of understory trees, indicating this species may benefit from fire exclusion. Ips avulsus catches were negatively correlated with total basal area, suggesting this species may benefit from more open habitats like those facilitated by frequent fire. We conclude that both soil properties and stand conditions interact with the fire regime to differentially affect the catches of southeastern bark and root-feeding beetle species in a longleaf pine ecosystem.

   center dot Many ecological communities (ECs) are in decline due to the impacts of inappropriate fire regimes and other threatening processes, many of which compound the impacts of fire.
   center dot Although Australian legislation, and that of most states/territories, provides for listing of ECs as threatened ( TECs), national assessment of the impacts of the 2019-20 wildfires on ECs is constrained by inconsistent EC definition, classification and mapping across jurisdictions.
   center dot Of TECs that were nationally listed as threatened prior to the 2019-20 wildfires, three had > 40% of their distributions burnt, and another three had 20- 40% of their extent burnt. Of a broader group of 92 fire-impacted ECs, including many listed as threatened by state jurisdictions, five had more than 90% of their extent burnt and 26 had more than half of their extent burnt.
   center dot The impacts of fire on ECs are diverse, but not always negative, and consequences can include changes in species composition (including reduced abundance of foundational species), vegetation structure, ecosystem functions, resource availability and incidence and extent of other threats.
   center dot The interval between successive fires is critical to community persistence, with irreversible changes ('ecosystem collapse') to disequilibrium states likely in some ECs, especially if inappropriate fire regimes disrupt life-cycle processes or transform habitats of key species.
   Main findings
   center dot Priority management responses needed to recover fire-affected ECs, and reduce the likelihood of further loss in future fires, include post-fire control of introduced herbivores; control of disease; protection of unburnt refuges from fire; protection of burnt areas from further fire; and protection of hydrological integrity.
   center dot Major knowledge gaps (including the mechanisms of threats, their interactions and effective control methods) constrain effective management needed for recovery.
   center dot Underlying these threats is a more pervasive need to reduce anthropogenic climate change. If this cannot be achieved, there will be ongoing diminution at least of rainforest, montane ash, peatland and montane heathland ecosystems.

AB  - In Canada, plains bison (Bison bison bison) was assessed by The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada as threatened. While bison are no longer at risk of demographic extinction, conservation programs remain challenged by the rarity of large populations and most bison are found in small, isolated, and confined herds. In this context, proper assessment of ecological carrying capacity is critical to inform habitat management and conservation efforts for species recovery. Although estimated food-limited carrying capacity is influenced by forage availability, forage requirements, and offtake proportion, it should also consider habitat selection by animals, especially inside confined settings to help avoid overgrazing. To support bison management in Grasslands National Park Canada, we integrated remote sensing, geographic information systems, and resource selection functions (RSFs) to examine variables that were potentially associated with bison habitat selection and return a comprehensive estimate of bison carrying capacity. Relevant variables were then integrated with estimates of forage availability using remote sensing and extrapolated to the bison containment scale. Factors of relevance to the RSFs include vegetation landscape units, slope, distance to water, fence, and road. In particular, bison selected for upland and sloped grasslands, which were characterized by the highest forage availability (1 064.5 kg ha(-1) and 1 238.5 kg ha(-1)), while avoiding water in both growing and dormant seasons. The top-performing RSFs models in growing and dormant seasons were assessed using k-fold cross validation and achieved good predictive capacity (Spearman rank correlation [r(s)] >= 0.83, P < 0.01). Application of traditional clipping biomass samples and remote sensing derived variables is helpful in estimating annual forage quantity for bison (R-2 = 0.75, P < 0.05). When accounting for bison resource selection, our model resulted in a carrying capacity estimate of about 0.0424 bison ha(-1) or 764-770 bison (each requiring 12.2 kg forage/d), compared with 0.0587 bison ha(-1) or 1 062 animals estimated when considering only the availability of forage. Such potential to increase carrying capacity to more than 1 000 individuals stresses the importance of testing management tools to shape bison grazing and increase forage utilization across a greater proportion of the 18 000-ha containment area. By improving our understanding of the interaction of this species with the mixed-grass prairie ecosystem, the integration of RSFs with estimates of carrying capacity can help inform conservation management of bison and multispecies at-risk habitat.

AB  - In southern European temperate forests, coppicing is a traditional form of forest management that shaped the present cultural landscape, providing multiple ecosystem services. Roe deer densities have been growing notably during the last decades mainly due to the abandonment of rural areas, changes in human land use and restocking.The impact of roe deer on coppice forests can affect the resprouting and, in turn, compromise the products and ecosystem services provided by these forests. During coppicing, stems are cut down close to the ground, where the growing shoots are exposed to deer browsing, especially during the early years following cutting.In this study, using a browsing exclusion experiment, we investigated the impact of browsing on temperate mountain hardwood coppice forests in the western Italian Alps over a period of eleven years following coppicing.We found that the impact of browsing was highest in the first two years following coppicing, with Quercus pubescens and Castanea sativa being the most affected tree species. The height of shoots was the variable that showed the biggest difference between fenced and unfenced areas. A significant negative effect of browsing on shoot height was found at the beginning of the experiment, with shoots growing in unfenced area showing the lowest height increments. After the third year, when the browsing intensity diminished, we observed the opposite trend, with shoots growing in unfenced areas showing higher height increments compared with fenced areas. A similar trend was observed also for the diameter of shoots over the course of the experiment. Eleven years after coppicing, however, the structural characteristics of the natural regeneration converged at all sites and in both fenced and unfenced areas.This study shows that coppice forests are resilient to browsing and are capable to recover growth loss within a few years after browsing has naturally diminished and stopped. The research conducted also points out the importance of medium-to long-term monitoring to assess post-disturbance dynamics and evaluate implications for management.

AB  - Appropriate grazing enhances grassland sustainability by simultaneously promoting biodiversity and productivity; however, the underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. We tested the hypothesis that grazing enhances biomass production by expanding the functional trait space of plant communities thereby improving resource acquisition and utilization efficiency. In a Tibetan alpine meadow, we conducted a yak grazing experiment with four treatments: grazing exclusion, light, moderate, and heavy grazing. We measured 13 functional traits across 22 common plant species, which were categorized grazing increasers, decreasers, or generalists based on their abundance responses to grazing intensity. Grazing increased biomass production by 16.7-28.0% compared to exclusion, with moderate and heavy grazing significantly expanding the functional trait space. This expansion showed a strong positive correlation with biomass production, primarily mediated by increased variation in leaf traits among sedges, legumes, and grazing-responsive species (i.e. increasers and generalists), which are associated with enhanced photosynthetic efficiency. Our study provides direct evidence for the ecological benefits of appropriate grazing and demonstrates, for the first time, how trait variation and species-specific responses jointly mediate the effects of grazing on community-level functional trait space and productivity. These findings advance mechanistic understanding of how individual plant responses to grazing scale up to influence ecosystem functioning and offer valuable insights for sustainable grassland management.

AB  - Upland aspen (Populus spp.) forests contribute significantly to biodiversity in their circumboreal role as keystone species. As aspen ecosystems flourish or diminish, myriad dependent species follow suit. The 43-hectare Pando aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) clone in Utah, USA, is thought to be the largest living organism on earth, but is faltering due to chronic herbivory. Long-term resilience in aspen communities, including Pando, rests on successful recruitment of vegetative suckers that are nutritiously desirable to browsing ungulates. Here, I evaluate aspen reproduction alongside numerous vital indicators of Pando's status in the first trend assessment of this embattled iconic forest. I remeasured 64 plots from 2017 using 19 indicators to determine current conditions. Findings show that the genetically uniform Pando is "breaking up" because of herbivory and fencing. Initial successes within fenced zones are tempered by nearly half of Pando that remains unprotected from chronic wild and domestic herbivory. I propose a strategy of process-based stewardship informed by adaptive monitoring to restore this famed "one-tree forest." Lessons from Pando may be applied to struggling, often species rich, aspen systems facing similar challenges globally.

AB  - Epizootic events of pneumonia, presumably caused by Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae, in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) have been observed in the western United States and Canada. Until recently, it was thought that populations of Mexican (O. c. mexicana) and Nelson's (O. c. nelsoni) desert bighorn sheep in Texas, USA, had not been exposed to Mycoplasma. Evidence of disease and potential population decline from outbreaks of M. ovipneumoniae are now known from several populations across the Trans-Pecos Ecoregion with documented instances of pneumonia and bluetongue in desert bighorn sheep from the Van Horn Mountains and Black Gap Wildlife Management Area. These disease events, especially those in 2019-2021, may be a result of increasing populations of aoudad (Ammotragus lervia), an introduced and invasive ungulate, in the region. With large population sizes and similar movement patterns as desert bighorn sheep, aoudad potentially are the reservoirs for bacterial and viral diseases, such as pneumonia and bluetongue, and are possibly contributing to the decline of desert bighorn sheep. Herein, we optimized the multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) with modifications in the Taq polymerase and annealing temperatures to determine the genetic identity of Mycoplasma strains or species within the nasal passages of desert bighorn sheep and aoudad in the Trans-Pecos Ecoregion of Texas. Four loci (small ribosomal unit, 16S; 16S-23S intergenic spacer region, IGS; RNA polymerase B, rpoB; gyrase B, gyrB) were characterized using MLST. Based on results from the modified MLST technique, we identified 9 desert bighorn sheep and 5 aoudad with M. ovipneumoniae, 9 aoudad with bacterial sequences genetically similar to M. conjunctivae, and 10 aoudad with bacterial sequences genetically similar M. hyopneumoniae. Of these, 9 aoudad possessed bacterial sequences genetically similar to both M. conjunctivae and M. hyopneumoniae. Among the 4 diagnostic loci, genetic divergence of M. ovipneumoniae ranged from 0.00-0.90% among desert bighorn sheep and aoudad. Future sampling efforts of seemingly asymptomatic aoudad, and asymptomatic, visibly sick, or deceased desert bighorn sheep, are important to monitor the spread of disease in desert bighorn sheep populations across mountain ranges in western Texas. It is imperative that aoudad removal plans are implemented to reduce and eliminate current infections and putative transmission of M. ovipneumoniae, prevent future disease outbreaks of pneumonia, and ultimately conserve desert bighorn sheep for future generations.

AB  - Biological invasions by cryptic ecosystem engineers can alter the ecological and socio-economic values of ecosystems in ways that may take decades to detect. The invasion of North American glacial refuges by non-native earthworms offers a prominent but understudied example of a cryptic invasion. Non-native earthworms are known to alter carbon sequestration, disrupt mycorrhizal networks and homogenize plant communities, but natural resource managers still lack robust protocols to identify and safeguard high conservation value communities (HCVCs) from such invasions. In the absence of such protocols, or reliable methods to eradicate non-native earthworm populations once established, there is an urgent need for methods to identify HCVCs at risk of or potentially shielded from earthworm invasion by the existence of abiotic barriers to their dispersal or persistence in such sites. We developed species distribution models (SDMs) using in situ field surveys and remotely sensed data to (1) identify factors limiting the occurrence of non-native Lumbricus earthworms in imperilled coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest and Garry oak (Quercus garryana) and maritime meadow ecosystems endemic to glacial refugia of the Pacific Northwest of North America and to (2) evaluate their influence on plant species diversity and identify abiotic factors capable of preventing their dispersal or persistence at a site. As predicted, shallow, drier soils and steeper terrain limited earthworm occurrence and abundance in our highly heterogeneous study area, and earthworm presence appeared to reduce plant species richness. Our results indicated that HCVCs endemic to shallow-soil (< 12 +/- 3 cm) sites that experience regular summer drought appear to act as refuges from invasion by non-native earthworms. Our results also elevate concerns for the conservation of deep-soil habitats not isolated from earthworm invasions by shallow soil, saltwater or other barriers to earthworm dispersal. The SDMs developed here offer guidance to the identification of potential refuges for the conservation of imperilled native species and communities from the detrimental effects non-native earthworms in glacial refugia of western North America and should thereby facilitate proactive planning by conservation practitioners.

AB  - The ubiquitous wild boar is causing diverse and growing conflicts of socio-ecological and economic relevance worldwide. For that reason, knowledge of its spatial ecology is crucial to designing effective management programmes. But this knowledge is scarce in Mediterranean areas with mixed land uses. We describe the spatial ecology and habitat selection of 41 adult wild boar monitored using GPS collars and analyse the effects of sex and the period (food shortage period, hunting season and food abundance period) under different land uses (protected areas, mixed farms and fenced hunting estates). The spatial ecology of wild boar was characterised by marked temporality, mediated by sex and the land uses in the area. The activity (ACT), daily range (DR) and home range (HR) were higher for males than females, and in mixed farms versus fenced hunting estates, while the lowest values were obtained in protected areas. These effects were more marked for ACT and DR (movement) than HR. The selection of scrublands and avoidance of woodlands was observed where drive hunt events occur (mixed farms and fenced estates), but not in the protected areas. The differences in the requirements, reproductive behaviour and, interestingly, response to disturbance according to sex may explain this dissimilar behaviour. Disturbance originated higher movement rates and the selection of sheltering land cover as a refuge during the hunting season. This information is useful for designing species monitoring and management programmes; including both preventive and reactive actions in response to events such as outbreaks of African swine fever and agricultural damage produced by wild boar in Europe.

AB  - Large population increases of Arctic-breeding waterfowls over recent decades have intensified the conflict with agricultural interests in both Eurasia and North America. In the spring-staging region Vesteralen in sub-Arctic Norway, sheep, dairy and meat farmers have reported reduced agricultural grassland yields due to pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus and barnacle geese Branta leucopsis that rest and forage in the region for 3-4 weeks in spring on their way to their breeding grounds on Svalbard. Here, we report from an experimental exclosure design where goose access to plots at three grassland fields in Vesteralen was prevented. The experiment was conducted over 3 years between 2012 and 2014. Goose abundance varied greatly between fields and years as a function of variable spring weather and forage quantity, facilitating evaluation of longer-term impacts under contrasting grazing intensities. First and second harvest yields across fields and years were 20% and 19% higher in exclosures than in plots open for grazing, while total yields (sum of first and second harvests) were on average 27% higher. Within-year effects on harvest yields varied substantially, primarily due to highly contrasting sward development during the spring-staging periods. Cool weather (2012) led to slow sward development and little or no effects on harvest yields, warmer weather (2013) resulted in generally large effects, while variable weather (2014) led to treatment effects varying across fields, with one field experiencing 61% higher yields in exclosures while there were no significant impacts on first-harvest yields at the two other fields. Goose grazing did not increase dry weight-based proportions of weeds. Overall, the farmers' reports on yield-loss due to goose grazing were confirmed, although impacts varied substantially between years. A novel finding is that second-harvest yields were also reduced. For the most affected farmers, it is unlikely that the current subsidy scheme is sufficient to cover all the their losses. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Most seabird species avoid predation by locating their breeding colonies in predator-free islands, inaccessible cliffs, capes, or on the mainland in Antarctica, the only continent without terrestrial predators. Departing from this general rule, a significant number of large Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) colonies exist nowadays in South American Atlantic mainland shores spanning a wide latitudinal range. Based on published radiocarbon dating of colonies, along with historical and archaeological records, we postulate that the current distribution of these colonies may be a response to predator eradication by sheep farmers. This would have made breeding habitats near marine food resources accessible and may have also reduced competition with neighboring colonies. We employed stable isotope analysis to estimate the penguin contribution to the diet of four pumas responsible for killing thousands of penguins in a breeding colony located within a coastal national park. Furthermore, we used a bioenergetic model to quantify the consumption of forage fish under different population distribution and abundance scenarios. We briefly discuss the implications of our results in the context of conservation policies aimed at establishing ecosystem baselines along the Patagonian shores.

AB  - We conducted the first extensive breeding bird and habitat survey across 21 islands and islets spanning 600 km of the eastern Mediterranean coastline of Turkey in 2016. Eight of the 21 islands hosted breeding colonies of at least one of three seabird species: European Shag (Gulosus aristotelis) on four islands and two coastal cliffs with 9-29 breeding pairs, Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis) on eight islands with 145-175 breeding pairs, and Audouin's Gull (Ichthyaetus audouinii) on one island with 6-7 breeding pairs. Two Scopoli's Shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea) were also observed during the coastal cruise, but no conclusive breeding evidence was collected. The single Audouin's Gull breeding colony alternated between two nearby islands, and the breeding population fluctuated between 6-10 pairs between 2016 and 2023. Comparisons between previous population estimates and the present survey indicated that the Audouin's Gull breeding colony has suffered a similar to 65-80% population loss in the last five decades. Habitat surveys revealed that 13 islands had some vegetation cover. Bushes were the dominant vegetation and hosted the highest seabird nest abundance. However, the highest seabird nest density was observed in herbaceous vegetation, which had only marginal coverage on the islands, potentially due to overgrazing by introduced rabbits and goats. Furthermore, surveys revealed occasional mortality of gull eggs, chicks, and adults as well as anthropogenic pressures on seabird breeding habitats such as uncontrolled recreational use and introduced mammals. The islands also hosted 15 other breeding bird species, including large populations of Alpine Swift (Tachymarptis melba , similar to 270 pairs) as well as several raptor species. Overall, our results indicated that there is significant seabird breeding activity in the eastern Mediterranean coastline of Turkey and an urgent need for ecosystem management to protect the habitat quality of these islands for seabird breeding populations.

AB  - Background The islands in the Persian Gulf are home to several species of gazelles, i.e., Gazella bennettii, G. subgutturosa, and a new subspecies of Mountain gazelles which was discovered on Farur Island and described for the first time in 1993 as Gazella gazella dareshurii. Later, phylogenetic analyses showed that the Mountain gazelles consist of two species: G. gazella and G. arabica. As the Farur gazelles are more closely related to the Arabian forms of the Mountain gazelles, this subspecies is regarded to be G. arabica dareshurii. Until now, the origin of this subspecies has been an enigma. Results Here, we used mitochondrial cyt b, two nuclear introns (CHD2 and ZNF618), and morphological data to address this question by investigating the taxonomic position of the Farur gazelles. The results show that this population is monophyletic and split from other G. arabica populations probably 10,000 BP. Conclusions It is a natural relict population that was trapped on the island due to the rising sea levels of the Persian Gulf after the Last Glacial Maximum. Intermittent drought and flooding are suggested to be the main factors balancing population growth in the absence of natural predators on this monsoon-influenced island. Conservation actions should focus on preserving the natural situation of the island (cease introducing mesquite tree and other invasive species, stop building new construction and roads, and caution in providing water sources and forage), and possibly introducing individuals to other islands (not inhabited by gazelles) or to fenced areas on the Iranian mainland (strictly isolated from other gazelle populations) when the population reaches the carrying capacity of the island.

AB  - Reintroduction programs have increased amid unprecedented biodiversity loss, yet the success of these programs lag. A prominent reason for program failure is dispersal beyond the planned range of the population. Management techniques, such as hazing, can be used to prevent movement beyond set boundaries, but to be effective long-term, the animals must learn to avoid the areas where they are hazed. Although concepts of animal learning have been used to improve reintroduction programs, learning is not often explicitly tested or used as an indicator of program success. We used a conservation behavior framework to evaluate how a range of management techniques influenced learning in a reintroduced population of bison in Banff National Park, Canada. We hypothesized exposure to stronger negative stimuli would enhance learning, leading to more pronounced behavioral responses. Specifically, we tested the degree to which management actions (i.e., drift fence encounters, foot, horseback, helicopter, and combined hazing) elicited behavioral responses and how they facilitated learning. Consistent with our predictions, drift fence interactions and foot and horseback hazing elicited fewer behavioral responses of a smaller magnitude than helicopter hazing or combined methods, suggesting these techniques cause less disturbance to the bison. Bison continually returned to locations where they encountered management actions that caused the least disturbance, demonstrating a lack of associative learning. Bison appeared to form negative associations with locations where they were hazed via helicopter or combined methods, however, and rarely returned to these locations. Evaluating management techniques is essential for improving conservation success. We demonstrate that by bridging the fields of conservation biology and animal learning, we can understand how management techniques influence learning and behavior thereby facilitating effective conservation plans that incorporate disruption levels of the animals, financial costs, and overall effectiveness. Effective conservation plans, in turn, improve our likelihood of successfully managing and recovering species.

AB  - Direct exploitation through fishing is driving dramatic declines of wildlife populations in ocean environments, particularly for predatory and large-bodied taxa. Despite wide recognition of this pattern and well-established consequences of such trophic downgrading on ecosystem function, there have been few empirical studies examining the effects of fishing on whole system trophic architecture. Understanding these kinds of structural impacts is especially important in coral reef ecosystems-often heavily fished and facing multiple stressors. Given the often high dietary flexibility and numerous functional redundancies in diverse ecosystems such as coral reefs, it is important to establish whether web architecture is strongly impacted by fishing pressure or whether it might be resilient, at least to moderate-intensity pressure. To examine this question, we used a combination of bulk and compound-specific stable isotope analyses measured across a range of predatory and low-trophic-level consumers between two coral reef ecosystems that differed with respect to fishing pressure but otherwise remained largely similar. We found that even in a high-diversity system with relatively modest fishing pressure, there were strong reductions in the trophic position (TP) of the three highest TP consumers examined in the fished system but no effects on the TP of lower-level consumers. We saw no evidence that this shortening of the affected food webs was being driven by changes in basal resource consumption, for example, through changes in the spatial location of foraging by consumers. Instead, this likely reflected internal changes in food web architecture, suggesting that even in diverse systems and with relatively modest pressure, human harvest causes significant compressions in food chain length. This observed shortening of these food webs may have many important emergent ecological consequences for the functioning of ecosystems impacted by fishing or hunting. Such important structural shifts may be widespread but unnoticed by traditional surveys. This insight may also be useful for applied ecosystem managers grappling with choices about the relative importance of protection for remote and pristine areas and the value of strict no-take areas to protect not just the raw constituents of systems affected by fishing and hunting but also the health and functionality of whole systems.

AB  - Geographic variation in ecosystem function is often attributed to differences in climate and soil properties, with biophysical constraints assumed to dictate spatial patterns in nutrient cycling, carbon storage, and plant productivity. However, biotic interactions, particularly herbivory, also vary geographically and can generate feedbacks that influence ecosystem processes. Using a replicated three-year field experiment, we tested how population-level functional differences in a widespread arthropod herbivore mediate geographic variation in ecosystem function. Structural equation modeling revealed that herbivores exerted strong direct effects on plant biomass, soil carbon, and nitrogen mineralization, often surpassing the influence of historical conditions and geographic variation in climate. Moreover, functionally distinct herbivore populations had divergent effects on nutrient cycling and plant diversity, demonstrating that population-level differences introduce novel pathways of influence on ecosystem function. These findings challenge ecosystem models that prioritize abiotic constraints and highlight the need to incorporate consumer-driven feedbacks into ecological frameworks.

AB  - Nowadays, gathering information about tree health conditions in cities is necessary. Trees are essential in regulating urban microclimate and mitigating the urban heat island effect. Therefore, their health status should be crucial in urban vegetation monitoring. The growing number of new cameras, sensors and research methods allows for a broader application of thermal data in remote sensing vegetation studies. This research aimed to evaluate whether it is possible to use thermal infrared data to assess the health condition of selected species of deciduous trees in an urban environment. More specifically, the data must have a 3.6-4.9 mu m spectral range, obtained during the day and the night. For this purpose, research was carried out in the city center of Warsaw (Poland) in 2020. During the airborne data acquisition, thermal data, laser scanning and RGB images were collected. Synchronously with airborne data, 617 ground references were obtained in different health condition classes (healthy, slightly poor condition, poor condition and dying) for five tree species: Acer platanoides, Acer pseudoplatanus, Aesculus hippocastanum, Tilia cordata and Tilia x euchlora. The results were as follows: (i) healthy trees were cooler than trees in poor condition and dying both during the daytime and nighttime; (ii) the difference in the canopy temperatures between healthy and dying trees was 1.06 degrees C of mean value on the nighttime data and 3.28 degrees C of mean value on the daytime data; (iii) all condition classes significantly differ from each other on daytime thermal data. The aerial thermal data can be considered a new alternative to hyperspectral data. Thermal sensing represents another method of assessing the health condition of trees in an urban environment especially data obtained during the day, which can differentiate condition classes better than data obtained at night. The method based on thermal infrared and laser scanning data fusion could be a quick and efficient solution for identifying trees in poor health.

AB  - Sagami Bay is among the most surveyed areas in Japan and the northwestern Pacific for marine biodiversity, partly owing to collecting efforts by the Showa Emperor, Hirohito. It was also here that the first chemosynthesis-based community was found in Japan, in the Off Hatsushima hydrocarbon seep site dominated by large vesicomyid clams. Nevertheless, new discoveries continue to be made in the deep. Here, we report observations of rare bathyal gastropods from unusual habitats. From the Off Hatsushima seep, the calliostomatid snail Otukaia kiheiziebisu was found living on tubeworm, the second record of the family from seeps. The cocculinid limpet Cocculina tenuitesta, previously only known from Suruga Bay, was found on a piece of branch-like plant debris inside the actively seeping clam field. This supports the step-wise evolutionary scenario from organic falls to hot vents recently suggested for this family. The predatory naticid snail Cryptonatica affinis represents the second record for the family at seeps, and we also show the first evidence for naticids feeding on chemosymbiotic clams-a phenomenon formerly only known from fossil seeps. We also found live individuals of Provanna stephanos, hitherto known from just two empty shells. Outside the seep area, the lepetid true limpet Sagamilepeta sagamiensis was found living on plastic debris, highlighting the function of plastic in the deep sea as settlement substrates among the muddy expanse. Our observations here have ecological and evolutionary implications, underscoring how much remains to be learned from the deep sea, even in well-studied areas like Sagami Bay.

AB  - The quality of savanna habitats across the globe has declined due to increased grazing pressure from introduced ungulate species. High grazing pressure can result in a loss of perennial grass cover, which can lead to the formation of "soil scalds" on clay soils. Scalds are maintained by the formation of a soil crust, which impedes water penetration and increases runoff. Scald formation can have significant negative ecological impacts on savanna ecosystems, yet the reversibility of this process remains uncertain. In this study, we examine perennial grass decline in a north Australian savanna, where historic grazing pressure has resulted in formation of soil scalds. We tested the reversibility of scald formation by implementing a soil treatment, which involved ripping the soil to a depth of 5-10 cm and placing erosion matting on the soil surface. In addition, ungulate exclusion fencing was erected to test if the presence of feral ungulates impacted scald recovery. After a year of above-average rainfall, both control and soil treatment plots showed significant recovery in perennial and annual grass cover, as well as a significant decline in bare ground cover. However, the degree of recovery was greatest in soil treatment plots, mainly due to increases in annual grass cover. This short-term study suggests that passive recovery of scalds is possible under favorable conditions and confirms that soil mediation can accelerate revegetation. In contrast, fencing was not found to have a significant effect on vegetation recovery, which is likely due to the low ungulate density present during the study. It is important to note, however, that our results are from a single season and a long-term study is required to confirm ongoing recovery. (c) 2022 The Society for Range Management.

AB  - Predation can have cascading, regulatory effects across ecological communities. Knowledge of the diet of predators can therefore provide important information regarding their ecology and conservation, as well as their impacts on prey populations. Using scats collected during 2019-2023 and estimates of prey abundance from aerial surveys, we characterized prey consumption and preferences of the Vulnerable African lion Panthera leo population in Tsavo, Kenya. Biomass models applied to prey frequencies in scats revealed that > 85% of lion diet comprised large ungulates weighing > 150 kg. The Critically Endangered hirola Beatragus hunteri and Endangered Grevy's zebra Equus grevyi (species that were introduced in Tsavo as part of ex situ conservation programmes in the 1960s) were amongst the seven prey species, of 16 detected, that were preferred by lions. Our results potentially indicate a disproportionate impact of lion predation on the small hirola and Grevy's zebra populations. Preferential predation, coupled with high availability of alternative prey, may trap the small populations of hirola and Grevy's zebra within a predator pit. Our findings provide a better understanding of lion diet, optimal foraging and the potential effects predators can have on threatened and rare prey species in an important conservation landscape. Based on our findings, we recommend an observational study of the predation ecology of lions and other predators in this system, to provide information on age- and sex-specific predation rates on hirola and Grevy's zebra for a population viability analysis, to support the management of these two threatened and rare herbivores in Tsavo.

We investigated antibody levels against Toxoplasma gondii in free-ranging cats and black rats (definitive and representative intermediate hosts) by ELISA and determined their relationships with landscape environmental factors on Tokunoshima Island, Japan, the Natural World Heritage site. We found a higher seroprevalence (>70%) in both cats and black rats in landscapes where the cattle barn density was high. This was consistent with higher density of rats revealed in our trapping survey. The spatial scale of landscape factors affecting infection was broader in cats (1 km buffer radius) than in black rats (100 m buffer radius). Both cats and rats showed an increasing trend in optical density (OD) values with increasing body weight and landscape cattle barn density, suggesting that the antibody concentration increases as the chance of exposure to T. gondii in the environment increases. Thus, management actions to stop humans from feeding cats and to control rat populations without using cats are both necessary to reduce the human health risk as well as to conserve endangered species on the island.

AB  - Coral restoration is essential for recovering depleted populations and reef ecological functions. However, its effect on enhancing fish assemblages remains understudied. This study investigated the integration of 3D-printed and natural Staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) out-planting to assess their role in enhancing benthic spatial complexity and attracting fish communities. Conducted between 2021 and 2023 at Culebra Island, Puerto Rico, we employed a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design to test four treatments: natural A. cervicornis, 3D-printed corals, mixed stands of 3D-printed and natural corals, and non-restored controls. Fish assemblages were monitored through stationary counts. Results showed that integrating 3D-printed and natural corals enhanced fish assemblages and their ecological functions. Significant temporal changes in fish community structure and biodiversity metrics were observed, influenced by treatment and location. Herbivore abundance and biomass increased over time, especially in live coral and 3D-printed plots. Reefs with higher rugosity exhibited greater Scarid abundance and biomass post-restoration. Piscivore abundance also rose significantly over time, notably at Tampico site. Fishery-targeted species density and biomass increased, particularly in areas with live and 3D-printed coral out-plants. Fish assemblages became more complex and diverse post-restoration, especially at Tampico, which supported greater habitat complexity. Before restoration, fish assemblages showed a disturbed status, with biomass k-dominance curves above abundance curves. Post-out-planting, this trend reversed. Control sites showed no significant changes. The study demonstrates that restoring fast-growing branching corals, alongside 3D-printed structures, leads to rapid increases in abundance and biomass of key fishery species, suggesting its potential role promoting faster ecosystem recovery and enhanced coral demographic performance.

AB  - Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer) currently number similar to 3000 on Nantucket Island. No deer were seen on the island at the beginning of the 20th century. The historical record suggests that a single male deer was brought to the island in 1922, and that 2 female deer were brought to the island from Michigan in 1926. After the deer population had increased to several hundred, additional deer (2 male and 3 female) were brought to Nantucket from New Hampshire in 1935 and 1936. To investigate the presence of founder effect in the population on Nantucket, we obtained samples of White-tailed Deer feces or muscle tissue from Nantucket; the New England mainland (including Cape Cod, southeastern Massachusetts, and a few samples from Maine, Connecticut, and Rhode Island), Shelter Island, NY; and Ann Arbor, MI. We amplified a portion of the mitochondrial control region (D-loop), and found 3 different sequences (haplotypes) among 35 deer samples from Nantucket. Two common haplotypes were identical or nearly identical to haplotypes from Michigan. One rare haplotype was also found in deer from the mainland in Connecticut and Massachusetts. This latter haplotype was unusual in that it contained 3 tandem copies of a 75 base-pair repeat, while most White-tailed Deer have 2 copies. In contrast, we found 5 haplotypes among 26 deer from the New England mainland. Haplotype diversity on Nantucket was 0.447 (+/- 0.082), and nucleotide diversity (pi) was 0.021 (+/- 0.005). Haplotype diversity on the mainland was 0.839 (+/- 0.029), and pi was 0.046 (+/- 0.002). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated little genetic differentiation among populations on the New England mainland (phi(ST) = 0.095, P = 0.113). However, when the population on Nantucket was included in the analysis, there was much more genetic variation among populations (phi(ST) = 0.414, P = 0.000). Our results indicate that most deer on Nantucket originated from 2 founding females from Michigan, and a small percentage are descended from later introductions from the New England mainland.

AB  - Fences are an important tool for anchoring reintroduced species to a target area, and there is a need to understand their effect on other wildlife species. However, little is understood about the response of wildlife to newly constructed fences over time. We evaluated fences used in the reintroduction of plains bison Bison bison to Banff National Park, Canada. These fences were designed to contain reintroduced bison while allowing for the free passage of other wildlife. In 2020, we provided an assessment of the permeability of several fence designs. Here, we investigated longer-term fence effects and addressed the emerging question of whether wildlife adapt their behaviours to navigate fences more effectively over time. We used an expanded array of remote cameras and a before-after-control-impact design to evaluate changes in detection probability for 12 species. Next, we tested for changes in crossing rates and travel speeds of migratory elk Cervus canadensis using 22 years of GPS collar data. Finally, we examined whether species detections or elk movements changed over time after fences were constructed. Changes in detection probability near fences were inconsistent between species. Elk fence crossing rates decreased after fence construction, and travel speeds slowed by a negligible amount. However, these effects were temporary - wildlife learned to cross fences more efficiently over time. Elk movement metrics followed a non-linear pattern after the appearance of fences and began returning to pre-fence states after approximately two years. Our study provides new information on the implementation of fences for conservation objectives while minimizing impacts on sympatric wildlife.

AB  - Cervus elaphus populations are spreading and growing in many parts of Europe. This growth can have detrimental effects on biodiversity and ecosystem function. Successful strategies to manage large herbivores require reliable information on density and population trends. This paper presents a methodology to achieve a sustainable distribution of red deer by age and sex classes over time. Instead of traditional algebraic methods, the method consists of a simple iterative process that uses convergence to obtain the dominant eigenvalue and eigenvector of the biological matrix from an initial population. This eigenvalue represents the annual growth rate of the population, and the eigenvector represents the ideal age and sex class distribution of the population. The method has been applied to a fenced preserve in the province of Toledo, Spain. An annual population growth rate of 1.63 (dominant eigenvalue of the biological matrix) was obtained from an initial population and the biological matrix of the deer on the preserve. The convergence of this rate occurred in year 14, but the carrying capacity allows for a population close to the population in year 17 according to the prediction, which is therefore considered to be the year when the ideal population distribution is achieved. This methodology allows managers to numerically justify how to control population growth to preserve biodiversity and sustainability.

AB  - Simple Summary Climate change is profoundly affecting ecosystem dynamics, with grassland arthropods serving as critical indicators. This in situ study examines the responses of arthropod communities to rising temperatures in intensively managed pastures on the volcanic island of Terceira (Azores, Portugal), employing a functional trait approach. Along an elevation gradient, Open Top Chambers (OTCs) were used to simulate increased temperatures, allowing the analysis of soil-dwelling arthropods over winter and summer seasons. Our results underscore the nuanced responses of arthropods to temperature variations across elevations and treatments within intensive pastures, revealing significant changes in functional community composition. This study emphasizes the importance of considering functional traits when assessing patterns of diversity in complex ecological communities involving multiple trophic levels.Abstract This study investigates the impact of elevated temperatures on arthropod communities in intensively managed pastures on the volcanic island of Terceira, Azores (Portugal), using a functional trait approach. Open Top Chambers (OTCs) were employed to simulate increased temperatures, and the functional traits of ground dwelling arthropods were analyzed along a small elevation gradient (180-400 m) during winter and summer. Key findings include lower abundances of herbivores, coprophagous organisms, detritivores, and fungivores at high elevations in summer, with predators showing a peak at middle elevations. Larger-bodied arthropods were more prevalent at higher elevations during winter, while beetles exhibited distinct ecological traits, with larger species peaking at middle elevations. The OTCs significantly affected the arthropod communities, increasing the abundance of herbivores, predators, coprophagous organisms, and fungivores during winter by alleviating environmental stressors. Notably, iridescent beetles decreased with elevation and were more common inside OTCs at lower elevations, suggesting a thermoregulatory advantage. The study underscores the importance of considering functional traits in assessing the impacts of climate change on arthropod communities and highlights the complex, species-specific nature of their responses to environmental changes.

AB  - The climate and biodiversity crises are inextricably linked and curbing both requires large-scale ecosystem restoration to be put into practice. In this context, trophic rewilding, which focusses on the restoration of megafauna and their ecological roles, remains a particularly major challenge. Many landscapes across the globe currently have low densities of megafauna or have lost these species altogether. Although some megafauna species have recovered in some places, through both passive and active rewilding, they are often confined to small areas. There is an increasing recognition that protected areas alone may not suffice to retain and recover high trophic complexity over large spatial extents in most of the world. This raises a clear need to scale up rewilding initiatives. Here, we discuss major challenges and potential solutions for such a scaling up of trophic rewilding, including land availability, supportive policies, the supply of animals for translocations and reintro-ductions, and funding. We illustrate these challenges and opportunities for two cases, the steppes of Kazakhstan and the Mediterranean rangelands. We highlight that ongoing structural change and agricultural abandonment offers opportunities for trophic rewilding in different world regions. Making use of these opportunities would require mainstreaming land-use planning that supports rewilding regardless of the current protection status of landscapes, and a reorientation of subsidies for agricultural activities in marginal lands to supporting restoration efforts. The supply of animals for reintroduction and population reinforcement projects represents another key challenge. This could be supported through a transition from farming to wildlife ranching, combined with ambitious breeding programs for keystone megafauna. Upscaling restoration efforts has recently been agreed upon as a global conservation target, and we here highlight the challenges and opportunities for restoring megafauna and their key role in ecosystems.

AB  - Grazing by large mammalian herbivores influences ecosystem structure and functions through its impacts on vegetation and soil, as well as by the influence on other animals such as arthropods. As livestock progressively replace native grazers around the world, it is pertinent to ask whether they have comparable influence over arthropods, or not. We use a replicated landscape-level, long-term grazer-exclusion experiment (14 years) to address how ground-dwelling arthropods respond to such a change in grazing regime where livestock replace native grazers in the cold deserts of the Trans-Himalayan ecosystem of northern India. We analyze spatial and temporal variation in the abundance of 25,604 arthropods sampled using pitfall traps across 2765 trap-days through the duration of the growing season spanning spring, summer, and autumn. These were from 88 operational taxonomic units covering six orders from 33 families (ants, wasps, bees, ticks and mites, spiders, grasshoppers, and beetles). We find that grazer assemblage-whether livestock or native herbivores-had a strong influence on both vegetation and arthropods. Partial redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that 53.6% of the spatial and temporal variation in arthropod communities could be explained by grazing and by grazer assemblage identity, alongside covariation with vegetation composition and soil variables. Structural equation models revealed that grazing and grazer assemblage identity have direct effects on arthropods, as well as indirect effects that are mediated through vegetation. Importantly, spiders (predators) were less abundant under livestock, whereas grasshoppers (leaf eaters) and ticks and mites (parasitic disease vectors) were more abundant, compared with native grazers. Reduction in spiders can fundamentally alter material and energy flow through the cascading effects of losing predators, and an abundance of grasshoppers may even contribute to vegetation degradation that is often associated with livestock. Parallelly, increases in ticks and mites lead to concerns over vector-borne disease that require planned interventions to align animal husbandry with One Health. Thus, losing native grazers to livestock expansion can have wide-ranging repercussions via arthropods. This may not only affect ecosystem structure and functions, but also offer challenges and opportunities to mitigate risks from vector-borne disease.

AB  - Simple Summary Biological invasions have become an important part of global change and result in devastating ecological and economic impacts worldwide. Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus Linnaeus, 1758) have been introduced to at least 100 countries for aquaculture, while it is currently recognized as one of the most dangerous invasive species in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. This study analyzed how Nile tilapia invasion disrupts the trophic structure of native species. The results showed that Nile tilapia invasion reduced the trophic status, shortened the food chain, and affected the isotopic diversity of native fish species. This study provided clear evidence that invasive Nile tilapia could destroy recipient ecosystem stability by disrupting the trophic structure and food chains of native communities. Widespread introductions of non-native species, including aquaculture and ornamental species, threaten biodiversity and ecosystem functioning by modifying the trophic structure of communities. In this study, we quantified the multiple facets of trophic disruption in freshwater communities invaded by Nile tilapia, by comparing uninvaded and invaded rivers downstream of the Pearl River, China. Nile tilapia invasion reduced the trophic status of native fish species by forcing native herbivores and planktivores to seek new food sources. The food chain was also shortened by decreasing the trophic levels of native invertivores, omnivores, and piscivores, while the total isotopic niche area (TA) of native invertivores, omnivores, piscivores, and planktivores species also decreased. Simultaneously, Nile tilapia invasion affected the isotopic diversity of the fish community. Decreasing isotopic richness (IRic), isotopic evenness (IEve), and increasing isotopic uniqueness (IUni) indicated that Nile tilapia had a high trophic niche overlap with native species and competed with native species for food resources, and even caused the compression of the trophic niche of native species. Understanding the process described in this study is essential to conserve the stability of freshwater ecosystems, and improve the control strategy of alien aquatic organisms in south China.

AB  - Exclusion of ground-nesting ants from tree canopies is an ant-management technique used in fruit crops. This strategy aims to disrupt the symbiotic relationship between ants and honeydew-producing herbivores, which are protected by ants, and enhance the biological control of these herbivores. Here, we evaluated this strategy to enhance the biological control of mealybugs in persimmon, but obtained an unexpected outcome. Using a randomized block design in a commercial persimmon orchard during two consecutive years, we demonstrated that physical barriers based on sticky bands excluded native ground-nesting ant species from persimmon trees and reduced the protection that these ants provided to mealybugs. The exclusion of native ground-nesting ants also increased the density and efficacy of the biological control agents of the mealybug. However, physical barriers favoured the establishment of the exotic canopy-nesting ant species Cardiocondyla obscurior. This ant species established its colonies under the sepals of persimmon fruit, and its abundance increased by more than 10 times in trees with physical barriers. Our results show that the exclusion of native ground-nesting from fruit trees can promote the control of invasive mealybugs, but may also facilitate the establishment and spread of exotic canopy-nesting ant species, hence increasing their invasive potential. Further research should evaluate alternative ant management strategies to enhance biological control of honeydew-producing herbivores without benefiting exotic canopy-nesting ant species.

AB  - Once widespread across the Holarctic region, the iconic and pre-historic muskox (Ovibos moschatus) has seen a significant range reduction, with endemic populations now restricted to North America and scattered populations introduced throughout Eurasia. In 1971, five individuals from the introduced Norwegian population migrated across the border into Sweden and re-established a natural Swedish muskox population in Harjedalen. While the size of this population has since fluctuated, up-to-date knowledge on the population size and status has been missing. In the summer of 2024, we therefore conducted a population survey and estimated the current population size to eight individuals. Although the population remains small and despite the absence of a formal wildlife management plan, the presence of a sub-adult and calf still shows an ongoing reproduction and suggests a viability and long-term local continuity of muskoxen in the area. Compared to the well-studied populations in North America and Greenland, little is known about the foraging ecology, habitat selection and ecological role of muskoxen in Scandinavia. Synthesizing published research from other regions, we explore the potential ecological services of the Swedish muskoxen, such as mitigating climate-induced changes like shrubification. We also report the results of our count of the population-eight individuals, including a calf and a sub-adult-and discuss its future prospects in Sweden, arguing that the environmental conditions in Scandinavia are indeed capable of supporting muskox populations.

AB  - This field note presents an early example of a forest climate adaptation tree planting project incorporating assisted migration in southern New England which is valuable in providing lessons that can inform future work in this region and elsewhere. This effort is notable for moving forward through the implementation and monitoring stages during a period when many similar projects encountered barriers. The project is located on watershed protection forestland owned by the Providence Water Supply Board, a public utility in Rhode Island. Using a suite of tools developed through the Climate Change Response Framework, watershed forest managers carried out a "transition" strategy climate adaptation planting in 2015, seeking to improve regeneration in an area of forest near the state's main drinking water reservoir. Seedlings of both native and assisted migration tree species projected to be adapted to future climate conditions were planted in adjacent areas that had experienced oak regeneration failure. Half of the seedlings of each species were planted within a deer exclosure fence and half were planted in an unfenced area. Annual monitoring has allowed for comparison of survival and growth of a subset of planted trees at these two sites for 10 growing seasons. Deer herbivory is believed to be the most significant factor contributing to differences in tree survival rates between the fenced and unfenced areas. Both native and non-native species have been able to survive when protected from deer browse, while differences are inconclusive after nearly a decade. This informal experimental planting provides a case study illustrating some of the opportunities and challenges associated with implementing assisted migration in a non-research, operational-scale setting.

AB  - Fences are increasingly used globally as a management tool in conservation to reduce wildlife depredations, disease transmission, and wildlife mortality. There are a limited number of studies on the genetic effects of perimeter fencing of protected areas on megaherbivores. Using population genetic analyses on 226 sequences of a 400 bp fragment of the mtDNA Dloop from 10 East African buffalo populations (3 fenced and 7 unfenced), the influence of spatial isolation and fencing on buffalo population genetic diversity and genetic differentiation was examined. Mean gene diversity between fenced and unfenced buffalo populations was not different (fenced: 0.978 +/- 0.003, unfenced: 0.973 +/- 0.004, p = 0.300), but nucleotide diversity was higher in fenced than unfenced populations (fenced: 0.038 +/- 0.019, unfenced: 0.030 +/- 0.015, p = 0.005). Genetic differentiation among buffalo populations based on haplotype frequencies and model-based genetic distance was weak (FST = 0.08, Phi ST = 0.06) and contributed to 6.2% and 8.5% of total genetic variance, respectively. Ninety-three percent of population pairs were genetically differentiated by distances determined from haplotype frequencies, but only 51% of population pairs were differentiated using modeled distances, suggesting recent differentiation. There was no correlation between linearized FST and geographical distance (r = -0.005, p = 0.52), but linearized Phi ST was moderately correlated with geographic distance (r = 0.329, p = 0.03). The distance effect was greater when fenced populations were excluded (Phi ST: r = 0.464, p = 0.05), suggesting that insularization due to fencing is distorting isolation by distance. SSD analyses revealed that 2 of 3 fenced populations and 2 of 7 unfenced populations had non-unimodal distributions, suggesting demographically declining populations. Our study reveals the high genetic diversity but warns that genetic erosion due to isolation, including fencing, is likely setting in and will have an impact on East African buffalo populations.

AB  - Introduction: The effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on wildlife are complex processes mediated by factors other than habitat size and isolation alone. For example, the quality of the surrounding matrix, edge-induced effects, and proximity to large forest tracks are of particular importance. These factors may allow or limit animal movements and, thus, population persistence in human-modified landscapes. This is the case in some remaining forest fragments in Costa Rican landscapes. Objective: To investigate the influence of the landscape composition on medium (< 10 kg) and large-sized (> 10 kg) terrestrial mammals thriving in an agricultural landscape, we surveyed mammal species in 30 sites in the Sarapiqui region, Costa Rica. Methods: We used 45 camera traps to assess the richness and composition of mammal species in forest fragments embedded in pineapple plantations and pastures from 2013 to 2014. Richness estimates were calculated using capture-recapture models for closed populations. We adjusted the models for repeated count data analysis to determine landscape cover types that best explained species richness. Results: Twenty-two species of mammals in nine orders and 16 families were recorded. Despite the habitat loss, fragmentation, and agricultural practice pressures over the years, the Sarapiqui region maintains a significant portion of its native mammalian fauna compared to comprehensive historical inventories available for the area. We found that forest cover best predicts the levels of species richness. Conclusion: many forest-dependent species, such as the threatened Baird's Tapir, can thrive in fragmented habitats in agricultural landscapes, while other species seem to be heavily affected by habitat modification and land use type. Forested areas and pastures with a high density of scattered trees and proximity to extensive forests could enhance the conservation of mammal communities despite the intense human land use in these agricultural landscapes.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carri & egrave;re (Eastern Hemlock) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the International Biological Flora: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to the environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, conservation and management, and global heterogeneity. Tsuga canadensis is a very shade-tolerant, long-lived and slow-growing canopy tree, native to eastern North America but widely planted in cool, humid parts of Europe as an ornamental. In its native range, it is commonly associated with Betula lenta, B. alleghaniensis, Fagus grandifolia, Acer saccharum and in the north Pinus strobus. Its distribution is mainly limited by lack of moisture; consequently, it grows best on moist soils, providing there is good drainage, but will also grow on rocky outcrops and steep eroding soils kept moist by seepage or a moist climate. Reproduction is by seed; both pollination and seed dispersal are by wind. Seedling establishment is best on damp mineral soil or on rotting logs and stumps, which are warmer and moister than deep litter layers of the forest floor. Eastern Hemlock has low value as a forest crop, but it is an important foundation species in the forest due to the habitats it offers directly and through its influence on the forest environment. However, Eastern Hemlock is in decline due to the introduced Woolly Hemlock Adelgid (Adelges tsugae; Hemiptera, Adelgidae) which kills developing buds, leading to extensive loss of needles and twigs, and death within 4-20 years. Cold weather can slow the progress of the pest, but global warming is acting against this. Chemical control and biological control using introduced beetles show some promise in isolated stands, but the prognosis is range-wide decline or extirpation.

AB  - Rewilding is one approach to restoration that aims at restoring natural self-sustaining ecosystems, allowing natural processes to resume by targeting an increase in trophic complexity, disturbance stochasticity, and dispersal, while minimizing human interventions. These components have also been argued to enhance ecosystem resilience, yet this claim has barely been specifically addressed. We conducted a meta-analysis to explore whether rewilding interventions aimed at increasing biodiversity (i.e., trophic complexity), disturbance stochasticity or connectivity increase ecosystem resilience to future abiotic and biotic disturbances. We integrated two recently developed operational frameworks to address rewilding and resilience and scrutinized the outcomes of 42 case studies (305 observations). We found that, overall, the three abovementioned rewilding components increased resilience of variables related to demography, biodiversity, biophysical characteristics and the disturbance regime characteristics (70% of observations). Yet, this result was influenced by the nature of the disturbance and the resilience approach, with lower success reported for abiotic disturbances (drought and fire) and social-ecological resilience. While interventions targeting only disturbance stochasticity or biodiversity and disturbance stochasticity together showed positive effects, interventions targeting the trophic complexity alone contributed less to system variables related to biodiversity. The most common rewilding interventions, such as domestic and wild herbivore introductions and invasive plant removals, enhanced resilience towards biotic disturbances (i.e., invasions). We also found that some particular resilience contexts (social-ecological systems) lack sufficient observations to allow clear conclusions. Overall, our results empirically demonstrate the predominantly positive effects of rewilding on ecosystem resilience, underpinning the potential of this approach for preparing ecosystems for the uncertain effects of increasing climate change and associated disturbances yet acknowledging some limitations depending on the nature of the disturbance.

AB  - In mammals, the gut microbiome is vertically transmitted during maternal lactation at birth. In this study, we investigated the gut microbiome and diets of muskox, a large herbivore inhabiting in the high Arctic. We compared the microbiota composition using bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and diets using stable isotope analysis of muskox feces of six female adults and four calves on Ella Island, East Greenland. Firmicutes were the most abundant bacterial phylum in both the adults and calves, comprising 94.36% and 94.03%, respectively. Significant differences were observed in the relative abundance of the two Firmicutes families. The adults were primarily dominated by Ruminococcaceae (73.90%), and the calves were dominated by both Ruminococcaceae (56.25%) and Lachnospiraceae (24.00%). Stable isotope analysis of the feces in the study area revealed that both adults and calves had similar ranges of C-13 and N-15, likely derived from the dominant diet plants. Despite their similar diets, the different gut microbiome compositions in muskox adults and calves indicate that the gut microbiome of the calves may not be fully colonized to the extent of that of the adults.

AB  - Background Anthropogenic linear features change the behavior and selection patterns of species, which must adapt to these ever-increasing features on the landscape. Roads are a well-studied linear feature that alter the survival, movement, and distribution of animals. Less understood are the effects of fences on wildlife, though they tend to be more ubiquitous across the landscape than roads. Even less understood are potential indirect effects when fences are found in tandem with roads along transportation corridors. Methods We assessed how the spatial configuration of fences and roads effect the movement (crossing effect) and distribution (proximity effect) of a partially migratory pronghorn population (Antilocapra americana) on the grasslands of southern Alberta, Canada. We used data from 55 collared pronghorn within a step-selection function framework to assess the influence of 4 linear features: (1) pasture fences, (2) roads not fenced, (3) roads fenced on one side, and (4) roads fenced on both sides on the selection pattern of migratory and resident animals. We examined whether steps along a movement pathway (i.e., crossing effect) were influenced by the type of linear feature animals attempted to cross and, whether these features affected the distribution of pronghorn (i.e., proximity effect) across the landscape. Results The top model for crossing effect for both movement tactics contained all 4 linear features and land cover. Regression coefficients were negative for all linear features, indicating that individuals were less likely to chose steps that crossed linear features. For the proximity effect, migrant animals avoided all linear features except roads fenced on both sides, where they selected areas closer to this feature. Resident animals, on the other hand, were found closer to pasture fences but further from roads without fences. Conclusions Our results indicate that both fences and roads are indirectly affecting pronghorn resource use spatially and behaviorally, whether each linear feature is found separately or in tandem. Modifying existing fences and roads to account for responses to these distinct linear features could facilitate more successful crossing opportunities and/or shifts in distribution. Allowing pronghorn to freely move across the landscape will maintain functional connectivity to ensure population persistence of this endemic ungulate.

AB  - Effective forest management, particularly during forest disturbance events, requires timely and accurate monitoring information at appropriate spatial scales. In Hawai'i, widespread 'ohi'a (Metrosideros polymorpha Gaud.) mortality associated with introduced fungal pathogens affects forest stands across the archipelago, further impacting native ecosystems already under threat from invasive species. Here, we share results from an integrated monitoring program based on high resolution (<5 cm) aerial imagery, field sampling, and confirmatory laboratory testing to detect and monitor 'ohi'a mortality at the individual tree level across four representative sites on Hawai'i island. We developed a custom imaging system for helicopter operations to map thousands of hectares (ha) per flight, a more useful scale than the ten to hundreds of ha typically covered using small, unoccupied aerial systems. Based on collected imagery, we developed a rating system of canopy condition to identify 'ohi'a trees suspected of infection by the fungal pathogens responsible for rapid 'ohi'a death (ROD); we used this system to quickly generate and share suspect tree candidate locations with partner agencies to rapidly detect new mortality outbreaks and prioritize field sampling efforts. In three of the four sites, 98% of laboratory samples collected from suspect trees assigned a high confidence rating (n = 50) and 89% of those assigned a medium confidence rating (n = 117) returned positive detections for the fungal pathogens responsible for ROD. The fourth site, which has a history of unexplained 'ohi'a mortality, exhibited much lower positive detection rates: only 6% of sampled trees assigned a high confidence rating (n = 16) and 0% of the sampled suspect trees assigned a medium confidence rating (n = 20) were found to be positive for the pathogen. The disparity in positive detection rates across study sites illustrates challenges to definitively determine the cause of 'ohi'a mortality from aerial imagery alone. Spatial patterns of ROD-associated 'ohi'a mortality were strongly affected by ungulate presence or absence as measured by the density of suspected ROD trees in fenced (i.e., ungulate-free) and unfenced (i.e., ungulate present) areas. Suspected ROD tree densities in neighboring areas containing ungulates were two to 69 times greater than those found in ungulate-free zones. In one study site, a fence line breach occurred during the study period, and feral ungulates entered an area that was previously ungulate-free. Following the breach, suspect ROD tree densities in this area rose from 0.02 to 2.78 suspect trees/ha, highlighting the need for ungulate control to protect 'ohi'a stands from Ceratocystis-induced mortality and repeat monitoring to detect forest changes and resource threats.

AB  - A large number of non-native species have been introduced to urban ecosystems, and it is a distinctive feature of the urbanization process. However, it is unclear whether these non-native species have similar functional traits to native ones and are similarly integrated into the local food web. We evaluated the differences in leaf functional traits and herbivory between native and non-native species of common woody plants in 50 parks in Beijing, China. The nutrient contents, defensive traits, and levels of herbivory were measured in 2681 leaves across 138 (52 native and 86 non-native species) woody plant species. Results show that compared to native species, non-native trees showed greater potential for short-term carbon sequestration, lower nutrient contents, and chemical defense but similar levels of herbivory. Non-native shrubs had lower carbon contents and herbivory levels than native shrubs. Phylogenetic history explained much more of the variance in plant traits and herbivory than spatial variation, suggesting the high homogeneity of environments among different urban parks. Furthermore, the variation in leaf traits and herbivory of non-native species had higher uncertainty than that of native species. Our research findings indicate that compared to native species in urban ecosystems, non-native species have reduced plant-herbivore energy flow to primary consumers, which may hinder biodiversity at higher nutrient levels. In the future, urban parks should incorporate more native plant species and enhance environmental heterogeneity.

AB  - Globally, rangelands are undergoing rapid social-ecological changes, yet the scale of these changes is rarely measured. Fencing, sedentarization, and land conversion limit access by wildlife and livestock to vital resources such as water and seasonal forage, leading to rangeland degradation. In addition, these changes limit connectivity between wildlife sub-populations, triggering a spiral of decreasing biodiversity and weakening ecosystem function. Moreover, the combination of land privatization, sedentarization and fencing endangers pastoral livelihoods by reducing resilience to drought and diminishing livestock holdings per person. We provide a unique, urgent, and vital snapshot across >30,000 km(2) of southern Kenya's rangeland, covering four ecosystems renowned for their rich megafauna and pastoral people. We document and explore the drivers of extensive fencing (similar to 40,000 km), the proliferation of livestock enclosures (>27,000), and the conversion of rangelands for cultivation (similar to 1,500 km(2)). Our analyses were based on an open-access database recently synthesized for the region. Fencing is generally more prolific in areas that have been converted from community tenure to private title, especially where land values are raised by agricultural potential and proximity to Kenya's capital, Nairobi. These factors drive the transfer of land ownership from traditional pastoralists to speculators, eventually resulting in the transformation of rangeland into agricultural, industrial and urban land uses. Space for wildlife (and traditional pastoralism) is limited on private, subdivided land, where livestock enclosures are at their highest density, and where there is less unfenced land and less untransformed land, compared to conservation areas and pastoral commons. Conflicting planning incentives, policies, and economic forces are driving unsustainable and potentially irreversible social-ecological transitions over unprecedented spatial scales. The lesson from southern Kenya is that a range of financial, policy and governance-related interventions are required to allow people and nature to coexist sustainably in African savannas.

AB  - The increased availability of quality genomic data has greatly improved the scope and resolution of our understanding of the recent evolutionary history of wild species adapted to extreme environments and their susceptibility to anthropogenic impacts. The guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the largest wild ungulate in South America, is a good example. The guanaco is well adapted to a wide range of habitats, including the Sechura Desert, the high Andes Mountains to the north, and the extreme temperatures and conditions of Navarino Island to the south. Guanacos also have a long history of overexploitation by humans. To assess the evolutionary impact of these challenging habitats on the genomic diversity, we analyzed 38 genomes (similar to 10 to 16x) throughout their extensive latitudinal distribution from the Sechura and Atacama Desert to southward into Tierra del Fuego Island. These included analyses of patterns of unique differentiation in the north and geographic region further south with admixture among L. g. cacsilensis and L. g. guanicoe. Our findings provide new insights on the divergence of the subspecies similar to 800,000 yr BP and document two divergent demographic trajectories and to the initial expansion of guanaco into the more southern portions of the Atacama Desert. Patagonian guanacos have experienced contemporary reductions in effective population sizes, likely the consequence of anthropogenic impacts. The lowest levels of genetic diversity corresponded to their northern and western limits of distribution and some varying degrees of genetic differentiation. Adaptive genomic diversity was strongly linked with environmental variables and was linked with colonization toward the south followed by adaptation.

AB  - Invasion of nonindigenous species is considered one of the most urgent problems affecting native ecosystems and agricultural systems. Mechanistic models that account for short-term population dynamics can improve prediction because they incorporate differing demographic processes that link the environmental conditions of a spatial location explicitly with the invasion process. Yet short-term population dynamics are rarely accounted for in spatial models of invasive species spread.Accounting for transient (short-term) population dynamics that arise from the interaction of age structure and vital rates, we predict the stochastic population growth rate and establishment probability of wild pigs following introduction into any location in North America. Established ecological theory suggests that the rate of spatial spread is proportional to population growth rate. Using observed geographic distribution data for wild pigs we calculated geographic spread rates (watersheds/year) from 1982 to 2021. We investigated if observed spread rates increased in watersheds with higher stochastic population growth rates. Stochastic population growth rate and establishment probability of wild pigs increased with increasing initial population (propagule) size and length of establishment time. Areas along the Mississippi, Ohio, and lower portions of the Missouri river drainages had the highest probability of wild pig establishment with many regions having probabilities close to 1. Spread rates demonstrated strong spatial heterogeneity with the greatest rates of spread (5.8 watersheds/year) occurring from 2008 to 2013 prior to the establishment of a National wild pig control program in 2013. Spread rates declined 82% (0.57 watersheds/year) in the period from 2013 to 2021 compared to the period from 1982 to 2013. We found significant positive associations among stochastic population growth rate and observed geographic rates of spread. Stochastic population growth rate explained a large amount of variation (79.3-92.1%) in annual rate of watershed spread of wild pigs. Our predicted probabilities of establishment and population growth can be used to inform surveillance and control efforts to reduce the potential for establishment and spread of wild pigs.

AB  - Ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation caused by human activities represent one of the greatest causes of biodiversity loss. However, the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation are not felt equally among species. Here, we examined how habitat loss influenced the diversity and abundance of species from different trophic levels, with different traits, by taking advantage of an inadvertent experiment that created habitat islands from a once continuous forest via the creation of the Thousand Island Lake, a large reservoir in China. On 28 of these islands with more than a 9000-fold difference in their area (0.12-1154 ha), we sampled plants, herbivorous insects, and predatory insects using effort-controlled sampling and analyses. This allowed us to discern whether any observed differences in species diversity were due to passive sampling alone or to demographic effects that disproportionately influenced some species relative to others. We found that while most metrics of sampling effort-controlled diversity increased with island area, the strength of the effect was exacerbated for species in higher trophic levels. When we more explicitly examined differences in species composition among islands, we found that the pairwise difference in species composition among islands was dominated by species turnover but that nestedness increased with differences in island area, indicating that some species are more likely to be absent from smaller islands. Furthermore, by examining trends of several dispersal-related traits of species, we found that species with lower dispersal propensity tended to be those that were lost from smaller islands, which was observed for herbivorous and predatory insects. Our results emphasize the importance of incorporating within-patch demographic effects, as well as the taxa and traits of species when understanding the influence of habitat loss on biodiversity.

AB  - Herbivores significantly influence plant communities by modifying interspecies relationships, which in turn impacts ecosystem functioning. Although excluding herbivores is expected to enhance the dominance of perennial plants, few studies have consistently explored how plants adjust the growth-defense-reproduction trade-off in response to changes at different stages of herbivore exclusion. We conducted a controlled fence experiment in Inner Mongolia grassland to examine the effects of vole exclusion on the dominance and adaptation strategies of two perennial grasses. We found that twelve years of Brandt's vole grazing altered the plant community composition, but in the second year of the exclusion experiment, Leymus chinensis quickly regained its dominance. This rapid recovery was facilitated by L. chinensis strategically shifting its growth-defense-reproduction investment over time. In the early exclusion phase, L. chinensis quickly enhanced its competitive edge by prioritizing vegetative growth and clonal reproduction. As the exclusion period progressed, the species transitioned to seed-based dispersal to enhance population fitness. In contrast, the dominance of Cleistogenes squarrosa was largely influenced by interspecific interactions rather than intrinsic adaptive changes. These results reveal plants can dynamically adjust their resource investment strategies to optimize population fitness at different stages of vegetation recovery. This enhances our understanding of plant community dynamics and the establishment and maintenance of dominant species in grassland ecosystems.

AB  - Human activities can globally modify natural ecosystems determining ecological, demographic and range perturbations for several animal species. These changes can jeopardize native gene pools in different ways, leading either to genetic homogenization, or conversely, to the split into genetically divergent demes. In the past decades, most European wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations were heavily managed by humans. Anthropic manipulations have strongly affected also Italian populations through heavy hunting, translocations and reintroductions that might have deeply modified their original gene pools. In this study, exploiting the availability of the well-mapped porcine genome, we applied genomic tools to explore genome-wide variability in Italian wild boar populations, investigate their genetic structure and detect signatures of possible introgression from domestic pigs and non-native wild boar. Genomic data from 134 wild boar sampled in six areas of peninsular Italy and in Sardinia were gathered using the Illumina Porcine SNP60 BeadChip (60k Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms - SNPs) and compared with reference genotypes from European specimens and from domestic pigs (both commercial and Italian local breeds), using multivariate and maximum-likelihood approaches. Pairwise F-ST values, multivariate analysis and assignment procedures indicated that Italian populations were highly differentiated from all the other analyzed European wild boar populations. Overall, a lower heterozygosity was found in the Italian population than in the other European regions. The most diverging populations in Castelporziano Presidential Estate and Maremma Regional Park can be the result of long-lasting isolation, reduced population size and genetic drift. Conversely, an unexpected similarity was found among Apennine populations, even at high distances. Signatures of introgression from both non-Italian wild boar and domestic breeds were very limited. To summarize, we successfully applied genome-wide procedures to explore, for the first time, the genomic diversity of Italian wild boar, demonstrating that they represent a strongly heterogeneous assemblage of demes with different demographic and manipulation histories. Nonetheless, our results suggest that a native component of genomic variation is predominant over exogenous ones in most populations.

AB  - The Brazilian endemic octocoral Phyllogorgia dilatata (elephant ear sea fan) plays a crucial ecological role in the marine ecosystems of the Brazilian coast. Our work investigates the local extinction of P. dilatata on Trindade Island, a remote oceanic island in the Southwestern Atlantic, and assesses the potential impacts of climate change on its distribution. Field surveys conducted over two years (2016-2019) revealed no live individuals of P. dilatata, with only dead peduncles remaining, marking the first observed local extinction of this species. Species distribution models (SDMs) incorporating current and historical climate data were used to estimate the species' habitat suitability and project future distribution under different climate scenarios. Results indicate that P. dilatata currently inhabits approximately 93,090 km2 of suitable area, primarily within tropical ecoregions, but faces significant habitat loss under future climate projections. By 2090-2100, models predict a 63.38 % loss of habitat under the high-emission RCP 8.5 scenario, with severe impacts on tropical regions, including Trindade Island. Environmental variables such as temperature, oxygen concentration, and salinity were identified as key drivers of the species' distribution, while non-climatic factors like seawater velocity, were also significant. The extinction on Trindade Island is attributed to a combination of historical isolation, climate change, and local anthropogenic stressors, including pollution and overfishing. The current investigation highlights the urgent need for conservation efforts, including the establishment of marine protected areas and restoration programs, to protect this vulnerable species and similar marine organisms again climate change.

AB  - Plant diversity is a known indicator of healthy ecosystems, therefore understanding interspecific relationships that structure plant communities is critical for invasive species management. A cryptic introduction of invasive macrophyte water chestnut (Trapa bispinosa var. iinumai) into the northeastern United States prompted investigation into potential competitive interactions between it and two common submersed species in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, Vallisneria americana and Hydrilla verticillata. Because the congeneric invader Trapa natans co-occurs in the same watershed with a documented history of negative environmental impacts, it was included for comparison. Reciprocal pairwise competitive effects between water chestnut and resident species were determined by additive reciprocal design, plants were grow in monoculture and biculture under controlled greenhouse conditions for one year. Competitive reciprocal effects between species were evident. Vallisneria americana produced 1.7 X more ramets in monoculture than in combination with Trapa spp. and tuber production was reduced by 37 % in biculture, independent of Trapa competitor. Trapa bispinosa var. iinumai fruit production was reduced by 80 % when grown in biculture with V. americana, and no fruits were produced when grown with H. verticillata. Biculture T. natans fruit production was impacted with less production observed for H. verticillata (54 %) than V. americana (25 %). Trapa bispinosa var. iinumai produced nearly 150 % more biomass in monoculture than T. natans, suggesting increased impacts in species-poor or disturbed areas. Findings suggest established monocultures of V. americana and H. verticillata may be vulnerable to invasion by either species of Trapa, but long-term competitive effects of invasion may not preclude co-existence.

AB  - BackgroundAbundant evidence exists that mobile animals exhibit different movement behavior during different seasons, especially in landscapes with strong seasonal variation in climate and resource availability. Quantifying seasonal movement dynamics is critical for making accurate inferences and appropriate recommendations for species conservation and landscape management. Using empirical approaches to characterize seasonal variation in animal movement minimizes assumptions about the timing of seasonal transitions, environmental proxies, and effects of spatiotemporal variation.MethodsWe calculated 57,255 mean daytime hourly movement rates for 104 scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah) released into a large protected area in central Chad from 2016 to 2022. We used these movement data to build generalized additive mixed models of movement rates over a generic calendar year to detect potential seasonal variation in oryx movement behavior.ResultsOur final model indicated that reintroduced oryx experience three seasons per year, exhibiting dramatically lower daytime movement rates during the hot, dry season and higher movement rates during the rainy and cool, dry seasons. Reproductive status also affected oryx movement rates, notably females 1-4 months into pregnancy.ConclusionsCaptive-born oryx exhibited transitions in movement behavior aligned with regionally characteristic seasonal variation, a promising indicator for an ongoing reintroduction effort. Females 1-4 months pregnant, particularly those accompanied by neonates, exhibited consistently elevated daytime movement rates, suggesting substantial energy allocation to foraging in early pregnancy. The three seasons delineated by this study will be used to manage the reintroduced oryx population, for example to identify priority areas and time periods for enhanced monitoring and enforcement actions, as well as to investigate the potential re-emergence of historical seasonal migrations.

AB  - Pollination by animals is a key ecosystem service(1,2) and interactions between plants and their pollinators are a model system for studying ecological networks,(3,4) yet plant-pollinator networks are typically studied in isolation from the broader ecosystems in which they are embedded. The plants visited by pollinators also interact with other consumer guilds that eat stems, leaves, fruits, or seeds. One such guild, largemammalian herbivores, are well-known ecosystem engineers(5-7) and may have substantial impacts on plant-pollinator networks. Although moderate herbivory can sometimes promote plant diversity,(8) potentially benefiting pollinators, large herbivores might alternatively reduce resource availability for pollinators by consuming flowers,(9) reducing plant density,(10) and promoting somatic regrowth over reproduction.(11) The direction and magnitude of such effects may hinge on abiotic context-in particular, rainfall, which modulates the effects of ungulates on vegetation.(12) Using a long-term, large-scale experiment replicated across a rainfall gradient in central Kenya, we show that a diverse assemblage of native large herbivores, ranging from 5kg antelopes to 4,000-kg African elephants, limited resource availability for pollinators by reducing flower abundance and diversity; this in turn resulted in fewer pollinator visits and lower pollinator diversity. Exclusion of large herbivores increased floral-resource abundance and pollinator-assemblage diversity, rendering plant-pollinator networks larger, more functionally redundant, and less vulnerable to pollinator extinction. Our results show that species extrinsic to plant-pollinator interactions can indirectly and strongly alter network structure. Forecasting the effects of environmental change on pollination services and interaction webs more broadly will require accounting for the effects of extrinsic keystone species.

AB  - Domestic livestock are widespread in seasonally dry forests, likely causing forest degradation and limiting tree seedling establishment. Shrubs can play an important role in facilitating tree regeneration, by protecting trees from livestock damage and ameliorating unfavorable abiotic conditions. We aimed at disentangling the relative contribution of grazing exclusion, long-term forest conservation, and the potential facilitation effect of shrubs on the performance of saplings of the native tree Kageneckia lanceolata. We planted 400 saplings in grazed and ungrazed areas situated both in a preserved and a degraded forest. In each situation, we established planting plots in three accompanying vegetation treatments: herbs, a nonleguminous spiny shrub and a leguminous spiny shrub. Survival of 3-year-old saplings was 10-fold higher in the preserved than in the degraded forest and 2-fold higher in the ungrazed than in the grazed site. Differences in survival among accompanying vegetation treatments were much smaller than between grazing treatments. Survival significantly increased with increasing protection by shrubs only in the degraded site. Sapling growth patterns were fairly similar to survival patterns, with no growth in the degraded forest, except for limited growth under both shrubs in the ungrazed site. We conclude that, in selecting plantation sites for the study species, forest condition and grazing exclusion should be prioritized over microsite selection based on neighboring vegetation.

AB  - Translocated animals typically find themselves in a novel environment in which they must establish a home range in a manner that will maximize their fitness. We hypothesized that the initial establishment of a home range is followed by adjustments expressed as home range shifting, and occurs as familiarity with the landscape increases, until the home range is stabilized. We studied the process of home range shifting in 42 female Persian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) reintroduced into the Galilee, Israel over a period of 2-5 years. We used changes in the degree of home range overlap between consecutive years as an indicator of stabilization. We then compared how the mean percent cover of the key vegetation types (woodland, scrubland and open pastures) differed between the areas abandoned in the first year's home range and the areas added to the last year's home range relative to the first (using a weighted paired t-test). We also compared the distribution (using chi(2) test of independence and Levene's test for homogeneity of variance) of %cover of the 3 vegetation types between the first and last year's home range. The average home range overlap increased over the 5 years following the first release. During the first-year post release, deer avoided open pastures and preferred woodland. In later years deer increase in the % open pastures (weighted t-test: p < 0.001) and decreased the % woodland cover (weighted t-test: p = 0.07) by abandoning areas with little open pasture and steeper terrain and moving into areas with more open pasture and moderate terrain. Variance of the cover types across individuals increased with time. We conclude that the home ranges of the reintroduced deer stabilized with time. The changes in vegetation and slope are driven by time-dependent changing needs reflecting a tradeoff between safety (refuge) and foraging. Our findings suggest that using the initially established home range to determine species preferences can create a misleading picture of what the optimal home range of the species really is. Individual variation in term of preferences can take a few years to be expressed due to the initial high-risk perceived by individuals in a novel environment.

AB  - A list of coral reef fish species of Huaguang Reef was compiled in 2023 using hand fishing, diving fishing, underwater video, and eDNA detection, combined with historical data from 1979 and archival records from the South China Sea Fisheries Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Fisheries Sciences for the years of 1998, 1999, 2003, and 2005. Successional characteristics of coral reef fishes through time were also explored. The findings revealed: (1) A total of 299 coral reef fish species were identified in Huaguang Reef, categorized into 2 classes, 16 orders, and 56 families, with Perciformes exhibiting the highest species count (234), constituting 78.26% of all species. (2) In comparison to the period of 1979-2005, there was a reduction in the number of species at the order and family levels in 2023 at Huaguang Reef. Both the average taxonomic distinctness (Delta+) and the variation in taxonomic distinctness (Lambda+) exhibited a declining trend, indicating disturbances in the fish ecosystem. (3) The proportion of herbivorous fish at Huaguang Reef remained relatively stable in 2023 compared to the 1979-2005 period. Notably, the similarity coefficient of herbivorous fish was the highest among different feeding types, signifying a degraded state of the Huaguang Reef habitat. (4) In contrast to the 1979-2005 period, a significant decline was observed in large-sized and carnivorous fish species at Huaguang Reef in 2023. The low similarity coefficients for both categories, with undiscovered fish species accounting for 58.49% and 45.76% of their respective taxa in the total list, respectively, suggested a notable impact of overfishing on coral reef fishes. The succession patterns revealed in this study provide a theoretical foundation for advancing the sustainable development of coral reef fish resources in the Xisha Islands and offer valuable insights for the protection and management of coral reef fishes.

AB  - Carnivores across much of the world are declining, leading to loss of biodiversity as well as the ecosystem services carnivores provide. In 2020, the Alexander Archipelago (AA) wolf was petitioned for protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) for the third time in 30 years. Concerns included habitat alteration from industrial timber harvest and subsequent declines in prey (deer), human-caused mortality, climate change, and genetic inbreeding. However, the underlying biogeography and ecology of these wolves continues to suggest resiliency across the subspecies' range, even though local populations may go extinct. If local wolf populations go extinct, it will result in loss of their ecosystem services (e.g., interactions of wolves with their prey, which prevents over-browsing and protects carbon sequestration in soils and trees), which will likely have major consequences for the local social-ecological system. Here, we updated a model we constructed for the last ESA listing process (2015) to examine the dynamics of wolf and deer populations on Prince of Wales Island (the primary geographic focus of all three petitions) in response to future environmental and management scenarios developed with stakeholders. Further, we considered how changes in deer abundance impact predation services (prevention of over-browsing by deer). We found that wolf populations generally persisted over 30 years, but dropped below an effective population size of 50 wolves in 10-98% of years simulated. Low wolf abundance resulted in higher deer abundance, which increased hunting opportunity, but also browsing damages (e.g., 19% of areas would be over-browsed if wolf harvest caps are removed, and >30% of areas would be over-browsed if wolves go extinct). Human harvest of wildlife was a key regulator of abundance and ecosystem services within the coastal rainforest social-ecological system; wolf abundance was most affected by wolf harvest regulations; and deer harvest restrictions increased wolf and deer abundances, but also greatly increased browsing impacts (>70% of areas heavily browsed if hunting ceased). Our findings support an integrated approach to management of this social-ecological system, such that social and ecological sciences are both used to monitor important components of the system (e.g., measuring public sentiment and likelihood of poaching, alongside wolf and deer numbers). Integration and adaptive approaches are needed to ensure that the many ecosystem services humans depend on are valued, conserved, and restored, including the cryptic predation services wolves have historically provided to the timber industry via reduced browsing pressure by deer.

AB  - Coxiella burnetii is the causative agent of Q fever. The main reservoirs for this bacterium, which can lead to human infection, in our region are typically cattle, goats, and sheep. In animals, C. burnetii infection is often detected due to reproductive problems. European Member States are required to report confirmed cases annually, but the lack of uniform reporting methods makes the data rather inconsistent. The Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise is involved in official controls to identify the causes of abortions, monitor suspected or positive herds, evaluate suspected infections in pets and humans, monitor the spread in wildlife, etc. In this paper, we summarize the presence of C. burnetii over the last five years (2019-2023). Additionally, a detailed overview of C. burnetii infection in wild and domestic animals is provided. Five hundred sixty animals-including cattle; goats; sheep; wild animals, such as deer, boars, wolves, roe deer, owls, and otters; buffalo; dogs; horses; cats; and a donkey-and six human samples were tested by real-time PCR on the transposase gene IS1111 to detect C. burnetii. The MST profile was identified in some of the samples. Outbreaks of C. burnetii occurred in four herds. In one of them, it was possible to follow the outbreak from inception to eradication by evaluating the effect of vaccination on real-time PCR Ct values. A total of 116 animals tested positive for C. burnetii, including 73 goats, 42 sheep, and one bovine. None of the other samples tested positive. The strains for which the ST was performed were identified as ST79, a strain that has been present in the area for more than ten years. The effect of vaccination on the reduction of positive samples and the variation of real-time PCR Ct values was evaluated in strict correlation.

AB  - Plant species height (mature height), which strongly correlates with other measures of size, is widely considered an important functional trait. Taller species contribute greatly to ecosystem function and are frequently identified as strong competitors. Additionally, important ecological processes like self-thinning scale with plant species size. In spite of the clear functional importance of species size, evidence for size-based plant community assembly rules has been scant. While herbivory can be species specific and there are reasons why herbivores may target larger plant species, it is unknown whether herbivory has size-biased impacts on species composition. In an old-field plant community, we compared plant species composition in herbivore exclusion (caged) and control plots over five years to test whether herbivore activity favors species at one end of the size spectrum. Across 5 years, smaller species were modestly, but consistently, underrepresented in caged plots compared to control plots. This underrepresentation of relatively smaller plant species in caged plots, where seedling herbivory was greatly diminished, was driven by lower small plant species richness and abundance in those plots; the abundance and richness of tall species did not differ across treatments. Our findings demonstrate that reducing herbivore activity in our study community modestly but consistently altered plant species composition, slightly favoring larger species. There was no evidence that larger species are preferentially targeted by herbivores. Some research suggests, although it will require further investigation, that seedling herbivory, regardless of the species eaten, produces vegetation gaps that small plant species are more successful in colonizing.

For this reason, harvests that result in partial rather than complete canopy removal have been suggested for cedar. However, success of regenerating cedar following partial harvests is uncertain, especially where there is heavy browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) or snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus). Efforts to understand how partial harvests and browsing interact to affect natural regeneration of cedar have been limited. We inventoried partially harvested stands along a gradient of 1-11 years since harvest in New Brunswick, Canada, in an area where deer frequently overwinter. Cedar regeneration was negatively influenced by browsing, but positively influenced by years since harvest and sapling basal area. Cedar seedling survival was assessed over a 2-year period and found to be primarily a function of height at initial measurement, with little influence of browsing. Annual vertical gain of cedar seedlings (a surrogate for height growth) decreased with increasing years since harvest and was influenced by distance from gap edge. In gaps, vertical gain increased with distance to gap edge, while distance to gap edge had a negative influence on vertical gain of seedlings in the matrix (between-gap areas). Many tagged cedar seedlings disappeared prior to remeasurement. These were likely completely consumed by browsers, limiting our ability to determine relative influences of partial harvest and browsing on cedar regeneration. We conclude that partial harvests, as applied in this study, increase cedar abundance and vertical gain, but browsing may necessitate seedling protection. We suggest monitoring to confirm sufficient cedar regeneration in partially harvested stands, using exclosures where browsing is a concern, and retaining or at least delaying removal of seed-bearing cedar overstory trees until regeneration has reached heights safe from browsing.

AB  - To examine the tree regeneration and forest structure under sika deer pressure, we established a 1.08 ha plot, including a 0.0176 ha fenced area, and measured DBH (diameter at breast height) and/or height of trees in 2005-2006 and 2015-2016 in a mixed forest in the Ohmine Mountains, Central Japan. Small trees (<10 cm in DBH) were few or none for most species, but for Pieris japonica. Densities of sapling trees (50 cm <= height < 130 cm) were not significantly different between fenced and non-fenced areas in 2005, and were significantly different in 2015. Owing to the treefalls of large trees by wind disturbances, the total basal area decreased by 1.6% from 53.3 m(2)/ha in 2005 to 52.5 m(2)/ha in 2015. In the non-fenced area, the annual mortality of the other trees (11.7%/year) than P. japonica was significantly greater than that of P. japonica (5.7%/year). The annual recruitment densities of saplings showed a great difference between fenced (1,670.5 stems/ha/year) and non-fenced areas (56.5 stems/ha/year). Although the light condition was improved by wind disturbance, sapling tree survival and growth, except for non-preferred P. japonica, had been inhibited through effects of sika deer pressure, resulting in the decrease in the saplings of preferred tree species and an increase in the saplings of non-preferred P. japonica at this study site.

AB  - This study demonstrated the plasticity of reef-decapod according with the exposed anthropogenic pressure. Comparing the reef-decapods at sites with different anthropogenic pressures in two different ecoregions (tropical and subtropical reef ecotypes), we demonstrated that historical anthropogenic activity is molding directly and indirectly their population. A direct impact over target decapods for fishing (e.g. Lobsters and large crabs) that are removed directly by human activities. A positive indirect impact related to a top-down trophic imbalance with the increase of naturally dominant preys (small decapod) due to the removal of top predators. Thus, insufficient predators to control the abundant prey in a classic unbalanced prey-predator relationship. An indirect and negative impact, related to a bottom-up trophic imbalance, is the exclusion of niche-restricted species in association with benthic cover (e.g. corals). This also has the positive outcome, however, of increasing numbers of herbivores, detritivores and scavengers. As hypothesis, we propose that a current biodiversity balance in anthropogenically impacted ecosystem is just reflecting past trophic cascade events. Where the remaining biodiversity is monopolizing the vacant niches after the removal of components in a trophic chain. Therefore, we are suggesting that reef-decapod biodiversity, observed using visual identification, can be used to highlight the "Ghost of the past anthropogenic impact" in threatened ecosystems.

AB  - Tropical oceans host a high diversity of species, including large marine consumers. In these oligotrophic eco-systems, oceanic islands often favour the aggregation of species and biomass as they provide feeding opportu-nities related to the mechanisms of island mass effect. As such, the waters surrounding La Reunion (Southwest Indian Ocean) host seabirds, large pelagic teleosts, elasmobranchs, delphinids and sea turtles. Isotopic niche partitioning and comparison of trophic levels among these species (n = 21) were investigated using stable carbon (delta 13C) and nitrogen (delta 15N) isotope analysis. Overall, delta 13C values were highly variable among taxa, indicating that the species exploit multiple foraging habitats along a coast-open ocean gradient. Overlap in delta 15N values was limited, except for teleost species, the two species of sea turtles and two species of delphinids, the Indo-pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) and the Spinner dolphin (Stellena longirostris). Stable isotope analyses of samples collected over a 9-years period on different tissues with different integration times provide a consistent picture of the structure of the community of large marine vertebrates species around La Reunion and highlight the underlying mechanisms to limit the competition between species. The wide range of isotopic values confirms that large marine vertebrates have different trophic roles in coastal marine food webs around this oceanic island, which limits their potential of competitive interactions for resources.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are a highly adaptable species that have invaded many regions and cause significant damage throughout the world. Ungulate-proof fencing is increasingly used in conjunction with other control techniques to manage wild pig populations. However, little is known about how fencing affects wild pig space use behaviors and whether any changes may be exploited to increase efficacy of control activities. Our goal was to understand how wild pigs altered their space use behaviors in response to newly constructed fencing. Specifically, we examined for changes in space use area (home range and core area), increases in overlap with conspecifics, and shifts in space use as ungulate exclusion fencing was constructed on northern Guam from February 2021 to March 2022. Wild pigs closer to the fence had decreased space use. For every 200 m nearer newly constructed fence, home ranges and core areas decreased approximately 15% and 16%, respectively. When individual wild pigs were enclosed by the fence, those animals increased their home range overlap with conspecifics by approximately 76% compared to wild pigs outside the fence. Wild pigs shifted their home ranges 3 to 9 times more during the first part of fence construction when 68% of the fence was completed compared to all other time periods, with male wild pigs shifting greater distances than females by 1.15 times. The construction of ungulate fencing led to smaller space use areas of wild pigs on both sides of the fence and intensified use of the area inside the fence by wild pigs contained within (i.e., more overlap). Management activities nearer the fence should account for decreases in home range and core area size to maximize population control efforts (i.e., more densely spaced trap sites). Enclosed wild pigs should be eradicated quickly to minimize damages to sensitive flora and fauna and decrease disease risk from intensified movement behaviors inside the fence.

AB  - The concept of rewilding, which focuses on managing ecosystem functions through self-regulation by restoring trophic interactions through introduced animal species with little human intervention, has gained increasing attention as a proactive and efficient approach to restoring ecosystems quickly and on a large scale. However, the science of rewilding has been criticized for being largely theory-based rather than evidence-based, with available data being geographically biased towards the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries, and a lack of objective data on rewilding effects on soil processes and C sequestration. In response to a call for data -driven experimental rewilding projects focused on national contexts, we collected unique data on the effects of large herbivore rewilding on soil properties from eight sites in the Czech Republic. These include sites with a wide range of edaphic characteristics that were grazed by Exmoor ponies, European bison, and back -bred Bos primigenius cattle (singly or in combination) for 2-6 years on areas ranging from approximate to 30 to approximate to 250 ha. Despite the relatively short duration of rewilding actions and considerable variability in the response rate of soil properties to grazing, our results indicate improved nutrient availability (evidenced by higher nitrification rate or higher soluble nitrogen concentration) and accelerated ecosystem metabolism (higher soil microbial biomass and dissolved carbon content). On longer-grazed pastures, rewilding contributed to soil carbon sequestration associated with increased water holding capacity and improved soil structure. However, other soil properties (reduced dissolved P concentration or total P content) showed signs of low P availability in the soils of the rewilding sites. Therefore, carcass retention should be considered where possible. Our data, although limited in number and geographic coverage, allow us to conclude that large ungulate rewilding has the potential to enhance soil carbon sequestration and related ecosystem services in rewilding areas. At the same time, we urge similar monitoring as an essential part of other rewilding projects, which will ultimately allow much more robust conclusions about the effects of this management on soils.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Multiple factors, both natural and anthropogenic, are driving most of the wild species to the verge of extinction across the globe. In order to conserve these threatened species, various conservation interventions and strategies are adopted, among which is re-introduction of captive stocks of species into the wild habitats where they vanished from. Captive breeding is one of the promising tools for endangered species preservation. Providing social enrichment to the captive stocks is an important step in the management, in particular for stocks, which are aimed for re-introduction. The subject species of this study, i.e., Punjab urial (Ovis vignei punjabiensis) and Indian gazelle (Gazella bennettii) are being reared in captivity with the aim of re-introduction. As there is scarcity of information regarding the behavioral aspects of captive species, especially ungulates, this study aimed at understanding the dynamics of their interactions. The current study reported that Punjab urial, being the dominant species, exerts itself on the submissive and subordinate species, the Indian gazelle. This negative interference can possibly lead to negative ramifications in the form of stress and injuries in the short term, while negative effects on population growth in the long term. Thus, this study recommends separate rearing of these species to eliminate the hazardous competition between them.
   Natural wildlife habitats are regularly subjected to anthropogenic pressures for different purposes, which are heading the biodiversity towards drastic decline. Several endangered wild species are raised in captivity with the aim of re-introduction. In some instances, mixed herds' rearing approach in captivity is adopted for providing social enrichment to captive stocks; however, the impacts of species on each other are least documented. We tested our prediction that keeping mixed herds of captive wild sheep and antelopes provides adequate social enrichment to the captive stocks: if interspecific interactions are balanced. In the current study, we studied the interspecific competition between mixed herds of captive Punjab urial (Ovis vignei punjabiensis) and Indian gazelle (Gazella bennettii) at Manglot Wildlife Park, Nowshera District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan. We documented the negative effects of behavioural interference by Punjab urial on the feeding behaviour of Indian gazelle. The outcome of the current study revealed that Punjab urial are highly intolerant towards Indian gazelle, with high interference during feeding. Out of the total aggressive events, 77% (N = 1259) of events ended up with win/loss, in which Punjab urial dominated the Indian gazelle 3.5 times. Moreover, lopsided dominance by Punjab urial resulted in increased intraspecific competition among Indian gazelle (p < 0.001). Current study divulged Indian gazelle to be the subordinate species, with less intake of food. Instead of providing social enrichment by heterospecifics, the Punjab urial is negatively affecting the Indian gazelle, therefore, the results of our study discourage the practice of admix captive breeding for wild sheep and antelopes.

AB  - The Philippine mouse deer (Tragulus nigricans) is an endangered ungulate species, endemic to the Balabac Islands in the Palawan Faunal Region of the western Philippines. Despite its conservation importance, it has received little attention from local authorities and conservation biologists, with limited studies conducted on the species. Here we provide a preliminary report on the species distribution, population and conservation status, based on our recently completed surveys. We used a combination of line transect distance sampling, opportunistic searching on targeted habitats, and informal community interviews to assess the species' status. We recorded a total of 25 sightings of mouse deer during our transect surveys. All records, including recent sightings of mouse deer, were from two islands, mainland Balabac and Bugsuk. No mouse deer were recorded on other islands that we surveyed, suggesting that the populations have been markedly reduced due to a nearly complete conversion of natural habitat, such as Ramos Island, or perhaps some islands are too small to permanently support populations. Our analyses revealed that the species occurs at low density (0.219 +/- 0.084/ha), particularly on Balabac. The mean population estimate based on Bayesian analysis is 2525 (95% Highest Density Interval, 1635-3461). However, this number is highly uncertain because of the low probability, highlighting the need for more information on the species' population. Several conservation efforts are being implemented now, but more intensive in situ conservation programs would benefit the species, along with other threatened endemics found in the region.

AB  - The Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is a major component of the Southern Ocean's ecosystem. Limited high-resolution data on the relative importance of oceanographic processes on the behavioral responses of krill at traditional predator foraging grounds constitutes a major obstacle in the understanding of krill-environment coupling and ecosystem-based management of this resource. Aggregation structures of krill and predator interactions were investigated using active acoustic data collected by WBAT echosounders deployed on moorings in two hydrographically different sites in Bransfield Strait. Near Nelson Island, water flows from the northwest to southeast while Deception Island is influenced by stronger net current velocities from the southwest to northeast. Krill aggregations were identified and then classified in three clusters using a swarm-identification algorithm and hierarchical clustering using aggregation morphological characteristics: acoustic density, mean depth, center of mass, inertia, equivalent area, aggregation index, and proportion occupied. A total of 693 and 736 aggregations were detected at the mooring sites close to Nelson and Deception Islands. The three aggregation categories ranged from high to low densities, evenness, and dispersion and were distributed throughout the water column. Krill aggregation density distribution and mean thickness are influenced by krill mean depth, current velocities and direction. The majority of observed predator dive profiles occurred over the aggregation type with highest krill densities at both Nelson and Deception Islands, and within the first 25 m of the water column. The heterogeneity of krill aggregations potentially impacts predator foraging strategies and predator-krill interactions in the hydrodynamically active Bransfield Strait.

AB  - Aim Decision-making products that support effective marine spatial planning are essential for guiding efforts that enable conservation of biodiversity facing increasing pressures. Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) are a product recently agreed upon by an international network of organizations for identifying globally important areas. Utilizing the KBA framework, and by developing a conservative protocol to identify sites, we identify globally importants places for breeding seabirds throughout the coastal seas of a national territory. We inform marine spatial planning by evaluating potential activities that may impact species and how a proposed network of Marine Management Areas (MMAs) overlap with important sites. Location Southwest Atlantic Ocean. Methods We collated a national inventory of all breeding locations for seabirds, including abundance records where available, and complementary estimates of at-sea distribution. We delineated areas of importance in coastal seas following approaches tailored to the ecology of species and assessed areas against global KBA criteria. To determine opportunities for species conservation and management, we reviewed which human activities have been documented to impact the target species globally via IUCN Red List accounts, and also assessed the overlap of important sites with a proposed MMA network. Results We identified global KBAs for nine seabird species (Anatidae, Diomedeidae, Laridae, Procellariidae, Spheniscidae, Stercorariidae) throughout national coastal seas. Globally important areas where multiple species overlapped were only partially accounted for in key zones of the proposed MMA network. Main Conclusions Development of a conservative protocol to identify marine sites for assessment against KBA criteria, revealed opportunities for enhancing a network of proposed Marine Management Areas in coastal seas. The framework we apply in this study has broad relevance for other systems where the design or review of management plans for the marine environment is required.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) can act as vectors for the introduction of pathogens in ecosystems and their transmission to threatened native species (TNS), leading to biodiversity loss, population reductions and extinctions. We assessed pathogens potentially occurring in a set of IAS in the Southern Cone of South America and identified TNS potentially vulnerable to their effects. Also, we assessed how risk analysis systems proposed or adopted by national authorities in the study region value the importance of pathogens. We identified 324 pathogens in the selected IAS, which could potentially affect 202 TNS. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) was the IAS with the largest number of pathogens (91), followed by domestic dog (Canis familiaris) (62), red deer (Cervus elaphus) (58), rock dove (Columba livia) (37), American vison (Neovison vison) (18), European hare (Lepus europaeus) (17), common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) (12), common slider (Trachemys scripta) (6), and American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) (2). Most TNS were in the "vulnerable" IUCN category, followed by "endangered" and "critically endangered" species. Bacteria were the most frequently represented pathogens (112), followed by ectoparasites (78), viruses (69), protozoa and other (65). The direct effects of IAS on native wildlife are beginning to be addressed in South America, and their potential impact as pathogen spreaders to native wildlife has remained largely unexplored. Risk analysis systems associated with the introduction of IAS are scarce in this region. Although the existing systems contemplate hazard analyses for the co-introduction of pathogens, they underestimate the potential impact of diseases on TNS. Conservation efforts in the region would benefit from systems which give pathogen risk a relevant place, and from government agencies promoting targeted disease surveillance in IAS and wildlife.

AB  - The study area is situated at Robert Island, which is located in the South Shetland Islands in the northwest of the Antarctic Peninsula. The diatom samples were taken as part of the Turkish Antarctic Expedition (TAE-II) which took place between March and April 2018. The samples were collected from the surface of sediments (c. 5 cm) at a depth of approximately 20 cm, 50-100 cm from the littoral zones of an inland glacial lake (L1) and three coastal lakes (L2, L3 and L4) situated on glacier-free area on Robert Island. The main objective of this study was to reveal the diversity and the abundance of diatom communities in the littoral sediments of the lakes on Robert Island. The lakes were shallow and oligotrophic freshwater lakes, although the coastal lagoons had a high conductivity and nutrient concentration. Twenty-six diatom taxa belonging to Achnanthes (1), Fragilaria (1), Frustulia (1), Gomphonema (1), Halamphora (1), Hantzschia (1), Hippodonta (1), Humidophila (2), Luticola (3), Melosira (1), Nitzschia (4), Pinnularia (3), Planothidium (2), Psammothidium (2), Stauroneis (1) and Stephanopterobia (1) were identified in the samples from these lakes. The coastal lake L2 showed the highest richness of diatom communities among the in studied lakes, with 21 identified taxa.

AB  - Seasonal changes in horn growth and testicular activity in wild bovid are mainly modulated by the photoperiod. Thyroid hormones are required for the transition from the rutting season to the end of the breeding season in domestic ruminants, but their role on modulation the seasonal horn growth in wild bovid is not clear. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that thyroid hormones are required for photoperiodically driven changes in horn growth and testicular activity of the mouflon as a model of wild ruminants. Plasma concentrations of thyroxine were reduced via treatment with propylthiouracil (PTU) under different photoperiodic conditions (natural photoperiod and artificial long days-LDP) from 1 November to 31 December. Plasma testosterone, plasma thyroxine, and horn growth were measured throughout the experimental period (November-March). The overall horn growth during the experiment was higher (p < 0.05) in LDP group than controls, PTU and PTU-LDP groups. The proportion of motile sperm, viable sperm, and sperm with an intact acrosome were reduced (p < 0.05) in PTU group in comparison with control. PTU-LDP showed the greatest progressive motility, straight-line velocity, beat-cross frequency, and linearity of sperm (p < 0.05). Morphological abnormalities were lower (p < 0.05) in LDP group than control. In conclusion, the stimulatory effect of the long-day photoperiod on horn growth requires adequate levels of thyroxine, which is also required for the transition from the rutting season to the end of the breeding season in mouflon.

AB  - The human footprint is rapidly expanding, and wildlife habitat is continuously being converted to human residential properties. Surviving wildlife that reside in developing areas are displaced to nearby undeveloped areas. However, some animals can co-exist with humans and acquire the necessary resources (food, water, shelter) within the human environment. This ability to coexist may be particularly true when development is low intensity, as in residential suburban yards. Yards are individually managed "greenspaces" that can provide a range of food (e.g., bird feeders, compost, gardens), water (bird baths and garden ponds), and shelter (e.g., brush-piles, outbuildings) resources and are surrounded by varying landscape cover. To evaluate which residential landscape and yard features influence the richness and diversity of mammalian herbivores and mesopredators; we deployed wildlife game cameras throughout Northwestern Arkansas, USA in 46 residential yards in summer 2021 and 96 yards in summer 2022. We found that mesopredator diversity had a negative relationship with fences and was positively influenced by the number of bird feeders present in a yard. Mesopredator richness increased with the amount of forest within 400 m of the camera. Herbivore diversity and richness were positively correlated to the area of forest within 400 m surrounding yard and by garden area within yards, respectively. Our results suggest that while landscape does play a role in the presence of wildlife in a residential area, homeowners also have agency over the richness and diversity of mammals using their yards based on the features they create or maintain on their properties.
