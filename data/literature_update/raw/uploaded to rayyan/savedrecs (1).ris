AB  - Galician forests in northwestern Spain are subject to frequent wildfires with high environmental and economic costs. In addition, due to the consequences of climate change, these fires are becoming more virulent, occurring throughout the year, and taking place in populated areas, in some cases involving the loss of human life. Therefore, forest fire prevention is even more relevant than mitigating its consequences. Given the costs involved in forestry work, alternative measures to reduce fuel load and create vegetation gaps are needed. One involves grazing by an endemic species of feral horses (Equus ferus atlanticus) that feed on thicket-forming gorse (Ulex europaeus). In a 100-ha forest fenced study area stocked with 11 horses, four 50 m2 enclosed plots prevented the access of these wild animals to the vegetation, with the aim of manipulating their impact on the reduction of forest biomass. The measurement of biomass volumes is an important method that can describe the assessment of wildfire risks, unfortunately, high-resolution data collection at the regional scale is very time-consuming. The best result can be using drones (unmanned aerial vehicles - UAVs) as a method of collecting remotely sensed data at low cost. From September 2018 to November 2020, we collected information about aboveground biomass from these four enclosed plots and their surrounding areas available for horses to forage, via UAV. These data, together with environmental variables from the study site, were used as input for a fire model to assess the differences in the surface rate of spread (SROS) among grazed and ungrazed areas. Our results indicated a consistent but small reduction in the SROS between 0.55 and 3.10 m/min in the ungrazed enclosured plots in comparison to their grazed surrounding areas (which have an SROS between 15 and 25 m/min). The research showed that radar remote sensing (UAV) can be used to map forest aboveground biomass, and emphasized the importance and role of feral horses in Galicia as a prevention tool against wildfires in gorse-dominated landscapes.

AB  - Insect herbivores can directly affect plant reproduction by feeding on reproductive tissues, or indirectly by feeding on vegetative tissues for which plants are unable to compensate. Additionally, early arriving herbivores may have cascading effects on plant reproduction by altering the later arriving community. However, the dynamic interplay between plant development and the assembly of herbivore communities remains underexplored. Hence, it is unclear whether non-outbreak levels of ambient herbivory early in the development of plants can impact plant fitness and to what extent these effects are mediated through changes in plant development and subsequent herbivory. By excluding the herbivore community in an exclosure experiment and by manipulating early-season herbivory in a common garden field experiment replicated across four Brassicaceae species and 2 years, we tested whether early-season herbivory by caterpillars (Pieris rapae) or aphids (Myzus persicae) affected development, reproduction, and the herbivore communities associated with individual plants. In addition, we tested a causal hypothesis to assess the relative importance and temporal interplay between variation in herbivore communities and variation in plant development in determining plant reproduction. Early-season herbivory affected plant reproduction in the exclosure experiment, with effects being highly dependent on the plant species, the herbivore species and the year. However, we found no such effects in the field experiment. The exploratory path analysis indicated that variation in plant reproduction is best predicted by variation in plant development, explaining 80% of the total effect on seed production. This suggests early-season herbivory had limited effects on later plant development, and plants were able to attenuate the impact of early-season herbivory. However, no clear compensatory mechanism could be identified. While early-season herbivory has the potential to affect plant reproduction through changes in plant development or the subsequent development of the associated community, these effects were small and varied across closely related species. This suggests that plant species may be exposed to different levels of natural selection by early-season herbivores through plant- or community-mediated effects on reproduction.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - The nitrogen and carbon cycles are fundamental ecosystem processes influenced by several factors including soil type and other abiotic factors, plant species, grazing and soil organisms. Herbivores profoundly influence the functioning of ecosystems and the recycling of nutrients in interaction with plants in natural ecosystems. This study focuses on the effects of livestock on carbon and nitrogen cycling in a grazed savanna in Burkina Faso. Dominant grass species (aerial and root parts) and soil samples were collected under grasses and bare soil patches in 48 plots (24 protected and 24 unprotected plots), 18 months after setting up herbivores exclosures. Soil and grass C-13 and N-15 were used as integrative indicators of carbon and nitrogen cycles. The results revealed no significant effect of livestock on soil total carbon and nitrogen and on soil delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. Moreover, grazing had no significant effect on grass carbon and delta C-13, while it significantly increased grass total nitrogen and delta N-15. Therefore, our hypothesis that grazing would increase soil C-13 and N-15 values and plant biomass was only verified for grass N-15. Grass delta N-15 results suggest that grazing improves the immediate availability of nitrogen but could also increase nitrogen losses.

AB  - Ecological stability in plant communities is shaped by bottom-up processes like environmental resource fluctuations and top-down controls such as herbivory, each of which have demonstrated direct effects but may also act indirectly by altering plant community dynamics. These indirect effects, called biotic stability mechanisms, have been studied across environmental gradients, but few studies have assessed the importance of top-down controls on biotic stability mechanisms in conjunction with bottom-up processes. Here we use a long-term herbivore exclusion experiment in central Kenya to explore the joint effects of drought and herbivory (bottom-up and top-down limitation, respectively) on three biotic stability mechanisms: (1) species asynchrony, in which a decline in one species is compensated for by a rise in another, (2) stable dominant species driving overall stability, and (3) the portfolio effect, in which a community property is distributed among multiple species. We calculated the temporal stability of herbaceous cover and biotic stability mechanisms over a 22-year time series and with a moving window to examine changes through time. Both drought and herbivory additively reduced asynchronous dynamics, leading to lower stability during droughts and under high herbivore pressure. This effect is likely attributed to a reduction in palatable dominant species under higher herbivory, which creates space for subordinate species to fluctuate synchronously in response to rainfall variability. Dominant species population stability promoted community stability, an effect that did not vary with precipitation but depended on herbivory. The portfolio effect was not important for stability in this system. Our results demonstrate that this system is naturally dynamic, and a future of increasing drought may reduce its stability. However, these effects will in turn be amplified or buffered depending on changes in herbivore communities and their direct and indirect impacts on plant community dynamics.

AB  - In this study, we analyzed the abundance and diversity (alpha, beta, assemblage composition, and indicator species) of marine shrimp near the Mar Virado and Couves Islands on the Northern Coast of S & atilde;o Paulo State, Brazil, over two years (1998-1999). We tested the hypothesis that the abundance and diversity of penaeoid shrimps are higher in areas adjacent to islands with a greater proportion of muddy sediments. The spatiotemporal associations of the Penaeoidea assemblage were examined in relation to environmental factors, including bottom temperature, salinity, organic matter, and sediment texture. A total of 1859 individuals were captured, representing three families and nine species. Mar Virado Island showed the highest shrimp abundance and diversity, a pattern associated with the predominance of fine sediments and higher temperatures. Xiphopenaeus spp., Penaeus schmitti, and Rimapenaeus constrictus were predominantly found near Mar Virado, whereas Penaeus paulensis and Penaeus brasiliensis were dominant near Couves Island. These findings highlight the critical role of island-specific sediment characteristics and water temperature in shaping shrimp distribution and diversity, with significant implications for fishery management and conservation strategies in these areas.

AB  - When wide ranging, herbivorous species such as African elephants (Loxodonta africana) are confined and their population densities increase, the vegetation may be negatively affected. Any changes to vegetation structure and complexity may then result in a series of ecological cascades on other plant and animal species that rely on the vegetation for survival. We assessed the composition and structure of the woody and succulent plants within the locally endemic Albany Thicket Biome at five protected areas (reserves) with elephants in the Eastern Cape province, South Africa in 2006 and 2016. We show that when elephant populations in this region are actively managed, wholesale negative impacts on woody thicket plant physiognomy are not observed. In fact, the only statistically detectable change over time, presumably due to elephants, was the toppling of larger, single-stemmed trees. We believe that because the Albany Thicket Biome evolved in the presence of large, top-down browsers such as elephants, the generally negative effects that have been observed of elephants on vegetation in savanna systems are not evident. However, the reserves with elephants in the Eastern Cape are all relatively small (< 400 km(2)) and fenced which prevents elephant dispersal. Thus, continued monitoring of elephant browsing effects is crucial for the future conservation of this unique biome.

AB  - Fire disturbance is an integral part of many ecosystems. However, some taxa may not be resilient to the increasing size, intensity, and frequency of fire events due to climate change. We investigated how terrestrial invertebrate Ordinal-level community structure and the abundance of six Orders (Acarina, Araneae, Coleoptera, Collembola, Diptera, Hymenoptera: Formicidae) changed following three natural fire events over two decades (2007-2022) in Kangaroo Island and mainland South Australia. We collected invertebrates using two methods (pitfall traps and sweep nets) at four sites (two burnt and two unburnt) every 6 months, before and after three fire events (2007, 2019, 2021). Ordinal-level community structure generally showed signs of recovery nearing pre-fire conditions within 20-22 months post-fire. The pitfall samples showed increased abundance in Coleoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera (Formicidae) following fire, and no change in Acarina abundance. The sweep net samples showed no recovery to pre-fire conditions on mainland South Australia, but recovery to baseline after 20-22 months on Kangaroo Island. There were significant shifts in invertebrate community structure across time-since-fire with a return to pre-fire conditions at burnt sites after 20-22 months. These findings demonstrate the apparent ordinal-level resilience of invertebrates in South Australian eucalypt woodlands, particularly of ground-dwelling species, but also point to Order specific differences that warrant future study.

AB  - Context, Introduced sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) are increasing in south-eastern Australia, and both volunteer and contract ground-based shooters are being used by management agencies to control their undesirable impacts. However, little is known about the effectiveness and costs of volunteer and contract shooters for controlling deer populations in Australia. Aims. We evaluated the effectiveness and costs of volunteer and contract ground-based shooters for controlling sambar deer and their impacts in a 5-year management program conducted in and around alpine peatlands in Alpine National Park, Victoria. Methods. Ground-based shooting operations were organised in two blocks. Within each block, four similar to 4200-ha management units were delimited, of which two were randomly assigned as treatment (ground-based shooting) and two as non-treatment (no organised ground-based shooting). In the treatment units, ground-based shooting was conducted using either volunteers or contractors. Each shooting team recorded their effort and the numbers of deer seen and shot, and used a GPS to record their track log and the time and locations of deer shot. Key costs were recorded for both shooter types. Key results. The catch per unit effort of contract shooters was four times greater than that of volunteer shooters. Both shooter types were most effective during the first half of the night and prior to sunrise, and when using a vehicle with a spotlight or walking with thermal-vision equipment. During the day, the use of gundogs to indicate deer significantly increased the success rate of volunteer shooters. Both volunteer and contract shooters used roads and tracks to move in the landscape, but contractors covered more ground than did volunteers. After accounting for key operational costs, the cost per deer killed was 10.1% higher for contract than volunteer shooters. Conclusions. The effectiveness of ground-based shooters is increased by operating at night using vehicles, spotlights and thermal-vision equipment. Contract shooters kill sambar deer at a faster rate, but are slightly more expensive per deer killed, than are volunteer shooters.

AB  - Perennial plants create productive and biodiverse hotspots, known as fertile islands, beneath their canopies. These hotspots largely determine the structure and functioning of drylands worldwide. Despite their ubiquity, the factors controlling fertile islands under conditions of contrasting grazing by livestock, the most prevalent land use in drylands, remain virtually unknown. Here we evaluated the relative importance of grazing pressure and herbivore type, climate and plant functional traits on 24 soil physical and chemical attributes that represent proxies of key ecosystem services related to decomposition, soil fertility, and soil and water conservation. To do this, we conducted a standardized global survey of 288 plots at 88 sites in 25 countries worldwide. We show that aridity and plant traits are the major factors associated with the magnitude of plant effects on fertile islands in grazed drylands worldwide. Grazing pressure had little influence on the capacity of plants to support fertile islands. Taller and wider shrubs and grasses supported stronger island effects. Stable and functional soils tended to be linked to species-rich sites with taller plants. Together, our findings dispel the notion that grazing pressure or herbivore type are linked to the formation or intensification of fertile islands in drylands. Rather, our study suggests that changes in aridity, and processes that alter island identity and therefore plant traits, will have marked effects on how perennial plants support and maintain the functioning of drylands in a more arid and grazed world.
   In global drylands, soils tend to be more fertile beneath tree, shrub and grass islands. Soil fertility was greater beneath taller and wider plants but was unaffected by either grazing pressure or the type of herbivore.

AB  - Background and aims: Parque Interjurisdiccional Marino Costero Patagonia Austral is a protected area that is home to incredible biodiversity. Within the Park is Isla Valdes, an island whose vegetation is unknown and where European rabbits, an invasive herbivorous specie, have been introduced. The aims of this work are: a) to know the floristic richness of Isla Valdes; b) to evaluate the conservation status of its flora; c) to identify and characterize the different vegetation units; d) to analyze the differences and their possible causes between the vegetation units. M&M: the island was traveled around establishing the different vegetation units. Three transects were made in each one, using the Floristic -Holistic Method for arid, semiarid, and subhumid areas. With the data obtained, vegetation structure and ecological parameters were calculated, a list of the floristic composition was drawn up, each vegetation unit was described, and the current state of conservation of the vegetation was evaluated. Results: 74 species were identified, distributed in 31 botanical families. Five vegetation units with different floristic compositions and plant physiognomy were identified. 12 species are included in Argentina's preliminary red list of endemic plants, and two species have international conservation status (IUCN red list and CITES). Conclusions: The work constitutes the first floristic list of Isla Valdes, and provides important information for management decisions.

AB  - Wild boar growth in numbers and range is associated with increasing economic and environmental impact. Hunting has been traditionally used to reduce wild boar numbers. Areas where hunting is not allowed may attract wild boar from neighbouring hunting grounds. This phenomenon is called 'reserve effect' and could cause temporarily localised, high densities of wild boar in areas where hunting is banned. To investigate the occurrence of 'reserve effect', this study was conducted in two natural reserves of 400 and 250 ha inside the Montseny Natural Park, Catalonia, Spain where regular hunting of wild boar is not permitted, and only sporadic driven hunts/year are authorised for population control. The aims of the study were to evaluate if wild boar use these reserves as a refuge when hunting is carried out in the surrounding areas and to assess the effects that occasional drive hunts inside these reserves may have on wild boar numbers and social organization. From 2012 to 2015 camera traps were placed in the two reserves without using any bait. Cameras operated for 1.759 days, including hunting and non hunting seasons, and 37.574 wild boar images were obtained. A 'reserve effect' was detected, as following hunting in the surroundings grounds, the number of wild boar increases inside reserves. Occasional driven hunts conducted in the reserves are effective in reducing the number of individuals and the effects persist for at least 45 days. Hunting disrupts wild boar social organization, as group size was significantly reduced. These results suggested that targeting refuge areas, once hunting in the surroundings causes wild boar to concentrate in these areas, is effective for population control. These findings could also be used to design trategies to optimise population control and offer opportunities for disease management such as vaccination, or to facilitate eradication in areas affected by disease outbreaks.

AB  - Fallow deer is one of the most widespread alien mammals in Europe. We documented the response of the roe deer population shortly after the fallow deer was introduced to a hunting ground in central Poland. Mean roe density dropped from 17.6 ind./100 ha to 10.5 ind./100 ha after the alien species was introduced. In the reference area, where fallow deer was absent, the roe deer density did not change in the analogue study period. At both study sites, mean roe deer productivity before fallow deer introduction was similar (1.6 juv./female). However, in the first study area, the productivity dropped to 1.4, while in the reference study area, it slightly increased to 1.75. The presence of fallow deer influenced roe deer space use negatively, i.e., the number of pellet groups of roe deer decreased with an increase in the number of fallow deer feces. Overall, the introduction of the fallow deer was successful and the population grew quickly. Yet, the economic impact of its introduction was far from satisfactory. At the same time, its negative influence on the roe deer was apparent. This shows that the fallow deer is an alien species threatening local biodiversity.

AB  - The mechanisms driving species co-occurrence are varied and include biotic interactions, abiotic factors, and scale-dependent processes. Based on a comprehensive dataset of lepidopteran herbivores recorded from a large-scale forest biodiversity experiment, we tested the contribution to herbivore species co-occurrence of herbivore phylogenetic relatedness, plant diversity and functional traits, and spatial scale. We found that Lepidoptera co-occurrence was negatively associated with their phylogenetic relatedness, tree diversity, and defensive traits, but positively associated with nutritional functional traits. Furthermore, species co-occurrence was higher at larger spatial scales (tree species or plot) than at smaller scale (individual trees). Our results provide evidence supporting both environmental filtering and competition exclusion hypotheses, and highlight the significance of functionality in shaping species coexistence of herbivores in plant-arthropod systems.

AB  - Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) ecosystems are highly valued in the southwestern United States because of the ecological, economic, and aesthetic benefits they provide. Aspen has experienced extensive mortality in recent decades, and there is evidence that many areas in Arizona, United States lack adequate recruitment to replace dying overstory trees. Maintaining sustainable levels of regeneration and recruitment (i.e. juveniles) is critical for promoting aspen ecosystem resilience and adaptive capacity, but questions remain about which factors currently limit juvenile aspen and which strategies are appropriate for managing aspen in an increasingly uncertain future. To fill these critical knowledge gaps, we sampled aspen populations across Arizona and collected data representing a suite of biotic and abiotic factors that potentially influence juvenile aspen. Specifically, we addressed two questions: (i) Is aspen sustainably regenerating and recruiting in Arizona? and (2) Which biotic and abiotic factors significantly influence aspen regeneration and recruitment? We found that many aspen populations in Arizona lack sustainable levels of juvenile aspen, and the status of recruitment was especially dire, with 40% of study plots lacking a single recruiting stem. Aspen regeneration was less abundant on warmer sites than cooler ones, highlighting the threat that a rapidly warming climate poses to aspen sustainability. Aspen recruitment was significantly more abundant in areas with recent fire than in areas without fire, and recruitment had a strong positive relationship with fire severity. The most important limiting factors for aspen recruitment were ungulate browse, especially by introduced Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus canadensis nelsoni), and the invasive insect, oystershell scale (Lepidosaphes ulmi). We conclude with a discussion of how management can promote sustainability of aspen populations by addressing the array of threats that aspen faces, such as a warming climate, chronic ungulate browse, and outbreaks of oystershell scale.

AB  - Rangeland-based livestock production constitutes a primary source of livelihood for many inhabitants of dryland regions. Their subsistence relies heavily on maintaining the productivity, biodiversity and services of these ecosystems. Harsh environmental conditions (e.g., drought) combined with land use intensification (e.g., overgrazing) make dryland ecosystems vulnerable and prone to degradation. However, the interplay between livestock grazing intensity and aridity conditions in driving the conservation and nutritional value of forage in arid and semi-arid rangelands is still not fully understood. In this study, we performed structural equation models (SEM) to assess the simultaneous direct and indirect effects of livestock grazing intensity and aridity level on community structure, diversity, biomass, forage production, forage C:N ratio and forage fiber composition in two semi-arid Mediterranean rangelands, NE Spain. Not surprisingly, we found that higher livestock grazing intensity led to lower community plant cover, especially when combined with higher aridity. However, both increasing grazing intensity and aridity were associated with higher forage production after one year of grazing exclusion. We did not find any adverse effect of livestock grazing on plant diversity, although plant species composition differed among grazing intensity levels. On the other hand, we found an aridity-driven trade-off in regard of the nutritional value of forage. Specifically, higher aridity was associated with a decrease in the least digestible fiber fraction (i.e., lignin) and an increase in forage C:N ratio. More interestingly, we found that livestock grazing modulated this trade-off by improving the overall forage nutritional value. Altogether, our results provide further insights into the management of semi-arid Mediterranean rangelands, pointing out that maintaining traditional rangeland-based livestock production may be a sustainable option as long as rangeland conservation (e.g., community plant cover) is not severely compromised.

AB  - The risk of carbon emissions from permafrost is linked to an increase in ground temperature and thus in particular to thermal insulation by vegetation, soil layers and snow cover. Ground insulation can be influenced by the presence of large herbivores browsing for food in both winter and summer. In this study, we examine the potential impact of large herbivore presence on the soil carbon storage in a thermokarst landscape in northeastern Siberia. Our aim in this pilot study is to conduct a first analysis on whether intensive large herbivore grazing may slow or even reverse permafrost thaw by affecting thermal insulation through modifying ground cover properties. As permafrost soil temperatures are important for organic matter decomposition, we hypothesize that herbivory disturbances lead to differences in ground-stored carbon. Therefore, we analyzed five sites with a total of three different herbivore grazing intensities on two landscape forms (drained thermokarst basin, Yedoma upland) in Pleistocene Park near Chersky. We measured maximum thaw depth, total organic carbon content, delta C-13 isotopes, carbon-nitrogen ratios, and sediment grain-size composition as well as ice and water content for each site. We found the thaw depth to be shallower and carbon storage to be higher in intensively grazed areas compared to extensively and non-grazed sites in the same thermokarst basin. First data show that intensive grazing leads to a more stable thermal ground regime and thus to increased carbon storage in the thermokarst deposits and active layer. However, the high carbon content found within the upper 20 cm on intensively grazed sites could also indicate higher carbon input rather than reduced decomposition, which requires further studies including investigations of the hydrology and general ground conditions existing prior to grazing introduction. We explain our findings by intensive animal trampling in winter and vegetation changes, which overcompensate summer ground warming. We conclude that grazing intensity-along with soil substrate and hydrologic conditions-might have a measurable influence on the carbon storage in permafrost soils. Hence the grazing effect should be further investigated for its potential as an actively manageable instrument to reduce net carbon emission from permafrost.

AB  - Herbivory of insular plant communities by introduced animals has been widely studied for decades. Though their diet mainly includes palatable and highly nutritive species, goats will also eat plants that are toxic to other animals. Thus, severe affection of toxic species may indicate high herbivore pressure or a low quality of vegetative food. To evaluate whether herbivory damage to low-palatability shrubs could give us information about feral goat pressure on vegetation, we assessed the predation impact of feral goats on the shrub Euphorbia dendroides (Euphorbiaceae) on Mallorca Island (Spain). We aimed to investigate whether goats consume juvenile E. dendroides and affect their population structure and determine if the plants increase the concentrations of toxic compounds as an adaptation to herbivory. Overall, two experimental plots and analysis of eleven natural populations indicated E. dendroides is affected by ungulates and that the population structure change with the presence of feral goats. Euphorbia dendroides could be used as an ecological indicator to determine the extent of ungulate damage to vegetation or indicate poor food availability, and thus inform the maintenance of optimal animal populations. Depending on the management objective for the territory, E. dendroides could be used as an ecological indicator to determine the extent of ungulate damage to vegetation or indicate poor food availability for animals, and thus inform the maintenance of optimal animal populations.

AB  - The Argentinian Ministry of Environment has approved the translocation of 45 guanacos from Southern Patagonia to the Pampas region, a distance of 1500 km, as the initial phase toward future translocations into a National Park located in the Chaco region, another 1600 km further North. This decision raises concerns about the technical and ethical aspects of the translocation. Firstly, there is a lack of proper evaluation and scientific evidence to support the need, opportunity, and feasibility of this translocation. The guanaco population is currently over one million and is increasing, and genetic differences exist among local populations. The translocation could produce anthropogenic-driven admixed populations, leading to genetic swamping and disrupting evolutionary processes. Second, there are ethical conflicts around managing wild species populations that prioritize private objectives and disregard local, publicly funded science. Rewilding projects require a deep understanding of interacting ecosystem processes, and of the socio-economic context. This management decision violates guiding principles for rewilding and should have followed proper scientific evaluation and transparent local consultation.

AB  - The success of invasive macrophytes can depend on local nutrient availability and consumer pressure, which may interact. We therefore experimentally investigated the interacting effects of nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) addition, the exclusion of large herbivorous fishes and mimicked grazing on the expansion rates of the invasive seagrass Halophila stipulacea. The experiments were established on Bonaire and Aruba, two islands in the southern Caribbean, which differ in fish community structure. We observed that multiple Caribbean fish species feed on H. stipulacea. At both study sites, nutrient enrichment decreased invasive leaf carbon:nitrogen ratios. However only on Bonaire, where herbivore fish abundance was 7 times higher and diversity was 4.5 times higher, did nutrient enrichment result in a significant reduction of H. stipulacea expansion into native Thalassia testudinum meadows. This effect was likely due to increased herbivory on nutrient enriched seagrass leaves, as we found that excluding large herbivorous fish (e.g. parrotfish) doubled invasive expansion rates in bare patches on Bonaire. On Aruba, H. stipulacea expansion rates were higher overall, which coincided with lower abundances and diversity of native fishes, and were limited by mimicked fish grazing. We suggest that top-down control by the native fish community may counteract eutrophication effects by increased grazing pressure on nutrient-rich invasive seagrass leaves. We conclude that diverse and abundant herbivore communities likely play an important role in limiting invasion success and their conservation and restoration may serve as a tool to slow down seagrass invasions.

AB  - Insect groups are declining worldwide; Lepidoptera are among the taxa most affected in terrestrial ecosystems. The main drivers of these declines are a diverse set of factors relating to environmental change including habitat loss, pollution, and climate change. In 2019 and 2020, we surveyed 118 and 90 islands, respectively, in southern Finland's archipelago for occupancy of Parnassius apollo larvae and counted the abundance of their host plant Hylotelephium telephium. Compared with historical data (1997-2003), the occupancy of Apollo butterfly larvae has decreased remarkably from about 75% to about 20% of islands and abundance declined as well. However, the abundance of their host plant has not changed. Occupancy models showed that the present occupancy probability is not affected by host plant numbers, and shows substantial colonization-extinction dynamics making the population vulnerable to stochastic extinction. Implications for insect conservation Our results show that this Apollo butterfly population is declining, and conservation actions are needed.

AB  - Wildlife trade is a key driver of extinction risk, affecting at least 24% of terrestrial vertebrates. The persistent removal of species can have profound impacts on species extinction risk and selection within populations. We draw together the first review of characteristics known to drive species use - identifying species with larger body sizes, greater abundance, increased rarity or certain morphological traits valued by consumers as being particularly prevalent in trade. We then review the ecological implications of this trade-driven selection, revealing direct effects of trade on natural selection and populations for traded species, which includes selection against desirable traits. Additionally, there exists a positive feedback loop between rarity and trade and depleted populations tend to have easy human access points, which can result in species being harvested to extinction and has the potential to alter source-sink dynamics. Wider cascading ecosystem repercussions from trade-induced declines include altered seed dispersal networks, trophic cascades, long-term compositional changes in plant communities, altered forest carbon stocks, and the introduction of harmful invasive species. Because it occurs across multiple scales with diverse drivers, wildlife trade requires multi-faceted conservation actions to maintain biodiversity and ecological function, including regulatory and enforcement approaches, bottom-up and community-based interventions, captive breeding or wildlife farming, and conservation translocations and trophic rewilding. We highlight three emergent research themes at the intersection of trade and community ecology: (1) functional impacts of trade; (2) altered provisioning of ecosystem services; and (3) prevalence of trade-dispersed diseases. Outside of the primary objective that exploitation is sustainable for traded species, we must urgently incorporate consideration of the broader consequences for other species and ecosystem processes when quantifying sustainability.

AB  - European wood-pasture landscapes have been the subject of intense debate, particularly in the early twenty-first century. This chapter provides an overview of the critical research and ideas underpinning much of that discussion. The nature and function of wood-pastures are introduced and the historical drivers of European wood-pastures are considered. Specifically, the social roles of wood-pasture are notable - and within the system the roles of large grazing herbivores are key drivers of structure and ecology. Oak Quercus spp., Hazel Corylus avellana and Blackthorn Prunus spinosa are important species in this dynamic system which harks back to Europe's primeval landscapes.

AB  - Successful species reintroductions require land managers to balance the goal of viable wildlife populations with potential risks to human enterprise. Such risks are particularly acute at the wildland-agriculture interface, where native and domestic species are likely to come into contact. In a national park in northern California, we combined insights from three lines of evidence - long-term visual surveys, short-term GPS telemetry, and satellite remote sensing-based animal detections - to characterize spatial overlap between reintroduced tule elk (Cervus canadensis nannodes) and domestic cattle and to estimate the importance of multiple environmental features as predictors of habitat selection by elk. Our results indicate that, at large spatial scales (i.e., home-range level), cattle were the primary driver of habitat selection, with the occurrence of elk being negatively associated with cattle across all seasons. In addition, elk consistently selected for grasslands on gentle, south-facing slopes that occurred at high elevation and close to ponds. NDVI was a seasonally important, positive predictor of habitat selection, with a marked reversal when this resource was concentrated inside of fenced cow pastures during the dry summer months. By contrast, a novel analysis of satellite-derived animal locations yielded no evidence of avoidance of cattle by elk (within pasture areas commonly used by elk), indicating that this population has acclimated to the presence of cattle through spatial partitioning of resources. Thus, this once-imperiled native ungulate exhibits patterns of habitat selection that reduce the potential for grazing conflicts with cattle, even in cases where access to forage is limited.

AB  - 1. Cover crops are multifunctional tools that mitigate environmental impacts of agriculture, enhance resilience to weather extremes and suppress weeds and arthropod pests. Cover crops provide non-crop food and habitat resources that attract natural enemies of pests, but their outcomes for pest management are less clear in regions where keystone mutualisms between red imported fire ants and aphids dominate.
   2. Here, we manipulate ant exclusion treatments and cover crop treatments (living mulches and terminated cover crops) that vary in food/habitat resources and examine responses of ants, aphids, other herbivores and predators in a cotton agroecosystem.
   3. Living mulches reduced both ants and aphids in the crop canopy by 97% and 93%, respectively, relative to bare soil treatments, and terminated cover crops reduced them as well by a lesser degree (similar to 50%).
   4. Non-aphid herbivores occurred in low densities system-wide and increased in living mulches, whilst native predators had variable responses to cover crops and ant exclusion.
   5. Cover crops had no effect on prey removal in the crop canopy, but living mulches tripled rates of weed seed biocontrol, relative to bare soils.
   6. Cover crops elicited a shift in fire ant foraging from cotton foliage downward to the soil-surface, preventing competitive exclusion by keystone ant/aphid mutualists that dominate crop monocultures.
   7. Cover crops altered the system-wide impacts of fire ants: reducing ecosystem disservices (i.e. aphid tending) and enhancing ecosystem services (i.e. weed seed biocontrol). These results provide incentives for cover crop adoption as a regenerative practice in large-scale commercial agriculture.

AB  - For many mammal species, converting dung density into population density requires accurate estimates of defaecation rate and dung survival time. The latter parameter probably varies seasonally. In Nki National Park, south-east Cameroon, we monitored 216 dung piles of the blue duiker Philantomba monticola and 373 of the red duiker group (Cephalophus spp.), major game animals in Central Africa, and estimated dung survival time across seasons. Mean survival time was 6.83 days in the major dry season and 1.21-1.81 in other seasons for the blue duiker, and 7.37 and 1.53-4.05 for red duikers, lower than the values conventionally used for density estimations in Central Africa (i.e. 18 days for the blue duiker and 21 days for red duikers). Overall, beetles removed half of the dung within 1 day of deposition. However, the proportion of dung piles that beetles removed was significantly lower in the major dry season, and other dung piles remained longer until they disappeared as a result of other factors. As shorter dung survival time results in higher estimates of population density, our findings imply that in forests with intense beetle activity, duiker densities are higher than those based on the conventional values of dung survival time. Duiker densities and dung survival time should be estimated simultaneously. To minimize the bias introduced by rapid removal of fresh dung by beetles, only fresh dung (< 3 hours old) should be monitored when estimating mean dung survival time.

AB  - Environmental conditions and resource availability shape population dynamics through direct and indirect effects of climate, biological interactions and the human modification of landscape. Even when a species seems dependent on predictable anthropogenic food resources or subsidies, ecosystem-level factors can still determine population dynamics across taxa. However, there is still a knowledge gap about the cascade effects driven by climate, vegetation functioning, resource availability and governmental policies on key aspects of species reproduction for top scavengers. Here we put to good use 22 years (2000-2021) of extensive population monitoring from the endemic Canary Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus majorensis) on the Fuerteventura Island (Canary Islands, Spain) to study the relative importance of demographic factors, ecosystem conditions and availability of anthropogenic food sources on breeding success. Our results suggest that ecosystem-level primary productivity, the number of livestock animals present on the island and Density-dependent processes determine the temporal changes in the breeding success of this species. We firstly accounted for a top-down effect of livestock on island vegetation, where overgrazing directly reduces landscape-level vegetation biomass. We, consequently, found a bottom-up effect between vegetation and the Egyptian vulture's breeding success. In this context, minimal changes in ecological conditions can impact the species inhabiting these ecosystems, with direct consequences on a key population stage, such as breeding season, when energy requirements are higher. These results are especially relevant because cascading and indirect effects of ecosystem processes and governmental policies are often overlooked when pursuing conservation goals of endangered species.

AB  - Assessing the spatiotemporal behaviour of alien species is pivotal to designing effective management plans. Interspecific niche partitioning among ungulates is reported as a strategy to avoid direct interactions. The Mediterranean mouflon and wild boar are two ungulates introduced to Elba island for hunting and aesthetic purposes. We used intensive camera trapping to test whether species occupancy and temporal activity rhythms would vary in response to the presence or absence of the co-occurring species through multi-species occupancy modelling. Our findings report a lack of spatial and temporal segregation between the two species for the late spring-summer and late summer-autumn seasons. In contrast, results for the winter-early spring period suggest that spatial partitioning between wild boar and mouflon is present in areas with high artificial cover (e.g., paved roads). Animals may indeed exploit roads to move more rapidly in search of food; however, their occurrence in these areas seems to be influenced by the presence of the other species.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that organisms with narrow niche requirements are particularly disadvantaged in small habitat patches, typical of fragmented landscapes. However, the mechanisms behind this relationship remain unclear. Dietary specialists may be particularly constrained by the availability of their food resources as habitat area shrinks. For herbivorous insects, host plants may be filtered out of small habitat fragments by neutral sampling processes and deterministic plant community shifts due to altered microclimates, edge effects and browsing by ungulates. We examined the relationship between forest fragment area and the abundance of dietary-specialist and dietary-generalist larval Lepidoptera (caterpillars) and their host plants in the northeastern USA. We surveyed caterpillars and their host plants over 3 years in equal-sized plots within 32 forest fragments varying in area between 3 and 1014 ha. We tested whether the abundances and species richness of dietary specialists increased more than those of dietary generalists with increasing fragment area and, if so, whether the difference could be explained by reduced host plant availability or increased browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). The overall abundance of dietary specialists was positively related to fragment area; the relationship was substantially weaker for dietary generalists. There was notable variation among species within diet breadth groups, however. There was no effect of fragment area on the diversity of dietary-specialist or dietary-generalist caterpillars. Deer activity was not related to the abundances of either dietary-generalist or dietary-specialist caterpillars. Plant community composition was strongly associated with fragment area. Larger fragments were more likely to include host plants for both dietary-specialist and dietary-generalist caterpillars. Deer activity was correlated with decreased host plant availability for both groups, with a slightly stronger impact on host plants of dietary specialists. Although dietary specialists were more likely to lack host plants in fragments, the relationship between fragment area and host availability did not depend on caterpillar diet breadth. This study provides further evidence that decreasing patch area disproportionately impacts specialist consumers. Because this relationship was derived from equal-sized plots, it is robust to some criticisms levelled at fragmentation research. The mechanisms for specialist consumer declines, however, remain elusive.

AB  - The Trinidadian red-brocket deer (Mazama americana trinitatis) is the only species of deer in Trinidad and is classified as a unique subspecies of red-brocket deer. Despite the importance of the species in Trinidad, to date there have been no published studies on their densities. We report on the densities of this species at four different sites in Trinidad over a 3-year period, with the first 2 years sampled during a hunting moratorium. Diurnal surveys were conducted, with density estimates calculated using King's Estimator. Surveys were repeated in both the dry and rainy seasons. A total of 312 deer on 1131.4 km of transect were observed over the study. Density estimates varied between different sites (1-16 individuals/km(2)), and between one and eight individuals/km(2) island-wide. Overall, the estimated density of red-brocket deer increased in two of four sites during the study period, indicating that the institution of the moratorium may have had a positive impact on populations of deer. The fact that density estimates varied considerably across the island suggests that harvest levels may need to be tailored for different sites.

AB  - Simple Summary Rusa unicolor swinhoei is an economically important animal in Taiwan, owing to the market demand for its velvet antler. In this study, we investigated the genetic diversity and structure of Formosan sambar deer using microsatellites. The observed genetic diversity was low, which is likely attributable to inbreeding and bottleneck effects. Moreover, this study revealed two distinct genetic groups within the captive populations and found no significant population genetic structure among the captive populations in Taiwan. These findings have the potential to improve breeding management and contribute to the mitigation of inbreeding, thereby promoting the productive potential of Formosan sambar deer.Abstract Formosan sambar deer (Rusa unicolor swinhoei) are of great economic significance in Taiwan, resulting in a substantial increase in deer farming to meet the high demand for velvet antlers. Inbreeding depression and reduced genetic variability can lead to the deterioration of captive populations. In this study, 239 Formosan sambar deer were genotyped using 13 microsatellites to analyze their genetic diversity and population genetic structure. Our results indicate a high-resolution power of these microsatellites in individual discrimination and parentage analysis. However, captive populations exhibit a low level of genetic diversity, likely because of inbreeding and bottleneck effects. Both principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and STRUCTURE analyses revealed two distinct and segregated genetic groups within the captive populations and indicated no clear population genetic structure among the captive populations. Introducing new genetic material from the wild through translocation offers a potential solution for mitigating the impact of inbreeding and enhancing genetic diversity. The comprehensive information obtained from these genetic analyses is crucial for the development of effective breeding strategies aimed at preserving and enhancing Formosan sambar deer populations.

AB  - Urban wildlife ecology is gaining relevance as metropolitan areas grow throughout the world, reducing natural habitats and creating new ecological niches. However, knowledge is still scarce about the colonisation processes of such urban niches, the establishment of new communities, populations and/or species, and the related changes in behaviour and life histories of urban wildlife. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) has successfully colonised urban niches throughout Europe. The aim of this study is to unveil the processes driving the establishment and maintenance of an urban wild boar population by analysing its genetic structure. A set of 19 microsatellite loci was used to test whether urban wild boars in Barcelona, Spain, are an isolated population or if gene flow prevents genetic differentiation between rural and urban wild boars. This knowledge will contribute to the understanding of the effects of synurbisation and the associated management measures on the genetic change of large mammals in urban ecosystems. Despite the unidirectional gene flow from rural to urban areas, the urban wild boars in Barcelona form an island population genotypically differentiated from the surrounding rural ones. The comparison with previous genetic studies of urban wild boar populations suggests that forest patches act as suitable islands for wild boar genetic differentiation. Previous results and the genetic structure of the urban wild boar population in Barcelona classify wild boar as an urban exploiter species. These wild boar peri-urban island populations are responsible for conflict with humans and thus should be managed by reducing the attractiveness of urban areas. The management of peri-urban wild boar populations should aim at reducing migration into urban areas and preventing phenotypic changes (either genetic or plastic) causing habituation of wild boars to humans and urban environments.

AB  - Middle Miocene deposits at Maboko Island in the Nyanza Rift of Western Kenya (-15-14 Ma) have yielded a rich fossil mammalian record that documents a mid-Miocene faunal shift. Palaeoecological proxies for Maboko have previously been interpreted to indicate heterogeneous habitats, ranging from grassland to closed canopy forest and implicated in this turnover. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope data of fossil herbivore enamel from catarrhine-bearing deposits at Maboko were analyzed to reconstruct the nature of C3 vegetation (i.e., waterstressed or subcanopy), as well as determining if any C4 biomass, representative of more open woodland or grassland habitats, were consumed. Taxa sampled include representatives of ruminants, suoids, rhinocerotids, and proboscideans. 813Cenamel and 818Oenamel values of Maboko fossil herbivores indicate foraging strategies consistent with a C3 dominated ecosystem, exhibiting a range of 813Cenamel signatures similar to those of extant browsing herbivores foraging in mosaics of open forest/woodland habitats. Within the Maboko sequence, isotopic evidence indicates varying environments based on variable dietary spectra associated with discrete fossiliferous units within the succession. Relative to other stratigraphic beds, isotopic signals of herbivore enamel from Bed 5b, for example, reflect more closed woodland/forest foraging. The overall -4%o range of 813Cenamel values from Maboko (-14.1%o to - 10.2%o) is statistically similar to 813Cenamel values from the slightly younger middle Miocene site of Fort Ternan and is consistent with faunal and paleosol evidence from Maboko suggesting ecological variability. However, the isotopic evidence from Maboko indicates that environmental variability is more constrained than previously reconstructed, instead ranging from more open canopy forest to open woodland habitats, albeit with some spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Closed canopy forest plants and C4 biomass were not detectable as dietary components for any herbivores sampled thus far; nor was there evidence of significantly water-stressed C3 vegetation (possibly C3 grasses) being consumed.

AB  - Recovering species are often managed in small numbers, requiring management strategies that maintain genetic variation for long-term viability. Here, we evaluate the genetic outcomes of two restored American bison (Bison bison) populations 15 generations after its reintroduction as Colorado's first wildlife reintroduction. After initial reintroduction in 1914 to Genesee park, the herd was split into two separate populations in 1938. To determine the genetic viability of the restored populations, we genotyped 36 individuals from both herds, analyzing 52 microsatellite markers to asses heterozygosity, allelic richness, inbreeding, and population structure. Both herds exhibit relatively high observed heterozygosity (Genesee: 0.775 sd = 0.183; Daniels: 0.781 sd = 0.178), high allelic richness (Genesee: 5.17 sd = 1.45; Daniels: 4.96 sd = 1.46), and negative FIS values (Genesee: -0.112 bootstraps = -0.158, -0.065; Daniels: -0.15, bootstraps = -0.191, -0.108), indicating a lack of inbreeding. Despite ongoing gene flow, the herds remain genetically distinct, as supported by pairwise FST (0.0354, bootstraps = 0.024, 0.046), Nei's D (0.136), and AMOVA results (FST = 0.078, p = 0.001). STRUCTURE analysis further confirmed that the herds maintain genetic clustering despite some admixture. These results suggest that Denver Mountain Parks' long-term management strategies - promoting controlled gene flow while preventing inbreeding - have been effective in maintaining genetic variation. Intentional individual movement between herds and introductions from external metapopulations have contributed to the long-term viability of these herds. This study highlights the success of small, intensively managed bison populations in maintaining genetic health over many generations and underscores the importance of gene flow strategies in wildlife restoration.

AB  - Trophic interactions are widely recognized to be a fundamental force shaping plant populations and communities. However, our understanding of how different consumers (i.e. grazers, insect herbivores and pathogens) affect plant performance (i.e. biomass, diversity, reproduction and/or survival) is fragmentary, particularly across diverse ecosystems and environmental contexts. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 3135 data comparisons from 296 papers to quantify the effects of removing plant consumers on plant biomass, diversity, reproduction and survival. We examined how these effects varied across ecosystem types (forest or grassland), levels of ecological organization (population or community) and study designs (field or pot experiment), as well as along environmental gradients (e.g. of temperature and precipitation) and across spatial scales (i.e. different plot sizes). Pathogen removal increased plant survival but reduced plant species diversity, supporting a role for pathogens in maintaining diversity through conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD). The removal of insect herbivores enhanced plant biomass, reproduction and survival, particularly at the population level and in field experiments. Grazing exclusion increased plant biomass, reproduction and survival, with legumes and trees showing particularly strong responses. The effects of pathogen removal on survival and grazing exclusion on biomass and reproduction were moderated by plot area, with stronger effects observed in larger plots. Synthesis. Our findings highlight the critical role of trophic interactions in shaping plant communities through top-down regulation. Grazers, insect herbivores and pathogens differentially impacted plant performance, with pathogens playing a key role in maintaining plant diversity through CNDD, while herbivores and grazers strongly regulated plant biomass, reproduction and survival. Our results also underscore the importance of considering spatial scale and environmental context when assessing consumer effects on plant communities. Ongoing global change may amplify these effects, with significant implications for plant community structure and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Northern Australian biomes hold high biodiversity values within largely intact vegetation complexes, yet many species of mammals, and some other taxa, are endangered. Recently, six mammal species were added to the 20 or so already listed in the Australian endangered category. Current predictions suggest that nine species of mammal in northern Australia are in imminent danger of extinction within 20 years. We examine the robustness of the assumptions of status and trends in light of the low levels of monitoring of species and ecosystems across northern Australia, including monitoring the effects of management actions. The causes of the declines include a warming climate, pest species, changed fire regimes, grazing by introduced herbivores, and diseases, and work to help species and ecosystems recover is being conducted across the region. Indigenous custodians who work on the land have the potential and capacity to provide a significant human resource to tackle the challenge of species recovery. By working with non-Indigenous researchers and conservation managers, and with adequate support and incentives, many improvements in species' downward trajectories could be made. We propose a strategy to establish a network of monitoring sites based on a pragmatic approach by prioritizing particular bioregions. The policies that determine research and monitoring investment need to be re-set and new and modified approaches need to be implemented urgently. The funding needs to be returned to levels that are adequate for the task. At present resourcing levels, species are likely to become extinct through an avoidable attrition process.

AB  - Ecosystem services and disservices by key animal groups such as birds, fruit bats and primates are often understudied. The lack of ecological knowledge results in persecution and culling due to perceived damage to fruit trees. We combined a control-treatment study with questionnaire data to untangle the actual and perceived impact of birds, fruit bats and primates in South African litchi orchards. Control trees produced significantly higher yields than caged trees. There was a weak but non-significant trend toward higher vertebrate damage on control trees compared to treatment trees. Questionnaire data found that weather and monkeys caused more damage to litchi fruits compared to fruit bats. There was also a strong consensus among farmers that damage varied between vertebrate (monkeys, fruit bats, birds and wild pigs) and invertebrate (insects), as well as abiotic factor (weather) groups. Farm type (commercial versus small-scale) showed a statistically significant difference in perceived damage caused by vertebrate groups and weather. Commercial farms reported higher damage caused by groups compared to small-scale farms. Synthesis and application. This study recorded relatively low incidences of crop raiding by fruit bats and highlights the economic benefits of biocontrol by insectivorous bats and birds, which outweighed the yield losses by fruit bats, birds and monkeys. Vertebrate exclusion to prevent crop damage limits access and biocontrol benefits provided by bats and birds. Farmers are unaware of the economic benefits of bats and birds; thus, it is vital to educate them on the ecological importance, which can outweigh the disservices resulting from fruit bats and reduce persecution by fruit farmers.

AB  - The European bison ( Bison bonasus L.) is a species that has been successfully reintroduced in several European countries and requires ongoing monitoring to protect and restore its biodiversity. This study examines the population dynamics of free-ranging European bison in the Vanatori Neamt Natural Park in Romania, taking into account various local biotic and abiotic factors. Data collected from the collars of several European bison from 2014 to 2019, as well as vector maps of the study area, was used for the analysis. Furthermore, the study identifies the influence of slope and altitude on the distribution patterns of the European bison throughout the seasons. While a confluence of biotic and abiotic factors shapes exploration behavior, the study underscores that food supply and land use exert the most pronounced impact on the sustainability and growth of the European bison population. Despite an exhaustive analysis of correlations between various biotic and abiotic factors with recorded temperatures, no significant results reflecting discernible trends or linkages induced by temperature were obtained. The analysis of GPS collar data revealed that, in the research area, the European bison inhabited areas with forest vegetation for about 74% of their time and places without it for 26%. Over 80% of the localization patterns were found in wooded areas, with fewer than 20% found in non-forest areas, year after year. The age class distribution research shows that the European bisons have a significant preference (more than 55%) for old-growth forests that are older than 100 years. This preference is present in all seasons except winter, when the preference for these types of forests decreases. On the other hand, forests that are younger and less than 60 years old are preferred in the summer and spring, which offers important information on the diverse habitat preferences of the European bison population.

AB  - Understanding of secondary succession, long-used as a unifying theme in ecology, continues to be informed by early-20th century chronosequence studies of old fields in the southeastern United States. However, growing evidence suggests classical, site-based indicators of successional change alone are not robust enough to capture realized compositional variation in eastern North American forests a century later. We illustrate how long-term data can provide deeper insight into forest dynamics and help identify additional indicators for predicting successional change. Using 80 years of permanent plot data from 36 forest stands in the Piedmont of North Carolina (USA) as a case study within the model system examined by foundational authors, we examine long-term trends in tree species abundance in both old-field pine forests transitioning to hardwood dominance and long-standing hardwood stands representing a range of historical, topographic, and edaphic conditions. We use a suite of descriptive and multivariate analyses to examine these long-term data and to assess them within the context of site conditions and novel drivers of change (e.g., removal of chronic fire, hurricane damage, increase in herbivore populations, and introduction of non-native plants and pathogens). Results indicate that these southeastern forests have undergone various perturbations that have collectively resulted in forests that are developing differently than predicted by classical models. Of particular note is the low recruitment of putative climax species such as oaks (Quercus spp.) and hickories (Carya spp.) and their replacement by novel understory communities, dramatic loss of dominant species (e.g., Cornus florida) due to nonnative pathogens, overcrowding by invasive exotic species, shifts in stem size distributions due to deer herbivory, and overall accelerated shifts in successional trajectory due to hurricane damage. We propose that potential shifts in predator abundance, nonnative species dispersal risk, pest and pathogen potential, changes in disturbance regimes, and frequency and timing of high-intensity disturbance can interact in various ways leading to variable and sometimes stochastic successional outcomes, and so these variables should be considered repeatedly through time as indicators of successional change in addition to classically-utilized indicators such as underlying site and abundance conditions. Using such a broad (and even dynamic) suite of indicators of forest change can more comprehensively enable accurate, long-term successional floristics modeling and resulting ecological and silvicultural management of temperate forests.

AB  - Coral community structure exhibits variation at each stage of its life cycle, but the spatial distribution of corals in early life stages, including from juvenile to adult stages, is not well understood, especially at a larger scale. Spatially, our study compared the genera richness and abundance of juvenile and sub/adult corals at 9 locations and 83 sites along the coast and small islands of western and eastern Sumatra, Indonesia. Field surveys were conducted by recording juvenile corals measuring <= 5 cm in diameter in 1 x1 m quadrat transects with 6 times randomly at each site, while those with diameters greater than 5-10 cm were categorized as transitional to sub/ adult corals. A total of 52 genera from 16 juvenile coral families were recorded and identified, which is higher than the sub/adult level, where a total of 40 genera from 14 families were found. The most common genera came from the Acroporidae (23.0 %), Merulinidae (18.7 %), and Agariciidae (12.7 %) families. The genera richness at the juvenile stage showed variation between locations and regions in western and eastern Sumatra, except between locations in the eastern region, while at the sub/adult stage there was no variation between the western and eastern regions. Abundance at the juvenile stage also showed variation between locations, but did not differ between the western and eastern regions and at locations in the eastern region. In contrast, coral abundance at the sub/adult stage showed differences between locations and regions, but did not show variation at locations in the eastern region. The abundance of juvenile corals was influenced by live coral cover, the presence of herbivorous and corallivorous reef fish, and hard substrates of dead coral, limited to sandy or muddy bottoms and coral rubble. Genera richness was also influenced by live coral cover, but limited by sandy and rubble reef habitats, the cover of other biota such as soft corals, and the presence of herbivorous fish. Variations in water conditions and geomorphological forms between locations on the west and east sides of Sumatra impacted the diversity and abundance of corals in the early stages of life, affecting their success in becoming adult colonies. The transition from juvenile to sub/adult corals emerged as a critical phase in the early life stages of coral for population maintenance and sustainability.

AB  - The South China tiger (Panthera tigris amoyensis) is a tiger subspecies unique to China and one of the top ten endangered species in the world. It used to play an important role in the overall function of the ecosystem. This study rationally screened out key prey species of the South China tiger-the Chinese serow, Chinese goral, tufted deer, water deer, Chinese muntjac, red muntjac, sambar deer, and wild boar. Candidate sites for the rewilding and reintroduction of the South China tiger were derived by exploring changes in suitable habitats for the prey using the MaxEnt model. The results show that: (1) by 2070, except for the high-suitability areas of water deer and Chinese muntjac, the areas of suitable habitats for the other six prey species would all have decreased significantly; (2) the location of the high-suitability area of the South China tiger obtained by superimposing the suitable areas of the eight prey species would be almost stable in 2050 and 2070, but the habitat index of some high- and medium-suitability areas would decrease and turn into low-suitability areas; (3) the core candidate sites were 83,415 km(2) in total, of which 25,630 km(2) overlapped with existing protected areas, accounting for 30.7% of the core candidate sites, and the remaining 69.3% of the core candidate sites were mostly distributed around the protected areas; (4) the maximum core candidate site area was projected to be 10,000 km(2) by 2070, which could support a small population of 23 male tigers and 66 female tigers to survive and reproduce in the wild. This study revealed the core candidate sites for the rewilding of South China tigers and estimated the number of tigers that could be reintroduced to these areas, providing a preliminary research basis for promoting the rewilding of South China tigers in China.

AB  - Long-term ecological monitoring of coral reefs can reveal the state of the reef communities and responses of different reef components to various pulse and press disturbance events. Here, we describe long-term monitoring of reef fish assemblages from two U.S. National Parks in Hawai'i, Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park (KAHO) and Kalaupapa National Historical Park (KALA) over the past decade. These two parks experience different anthropogenic disturbances as KAHO is highly accessible with multiple types of adjacent land use while KALA is relatively inaccessible, surrounded by large expanses of native forest, and known for having the highest documented fish biomass within the main Hawaiian Islands. The fish assemblages in KAHO were numerically dominated by small-bodied damselfish Chromis spp. and herbivorous surgeonfishes Acanthurus nigrofuscus, Ctenochaetus strigosus and Zebrasoma flavescens, while those in KALA were numerically dominated by Chromis vanderbilti, A. nigrofuscus, Thalassoma duperrey and Paracirrhites arcatus. Multivariate control charts detected anomalies in the fish assemblages in some years. In KAHO, gradual shifts in the assemblages were detected in recent years due to changes (both increases and decreases) in relative abundances of numerically dominant species including Chromis agilis, C. vanderbilti, A. nigrofuscus, C. strigosus and Z. flavescens. There was a documented reduction in live coral cover in KAHO due to a bleaching event in 2015, and potential delayed effects of the coral mortality on the fish assemblages were found particularly in the North and South regions of the park. In KALA, increases in the abundances of Acanthurus (A. blochii, A. leucopareius, A. nigrofuscus, A. thompsoni and A. triostegus) and C. strigosus were found in 2014, likely due to a large recruitment event that had not been well reported. As localized thermal stress events were detected in both KAHO and KALA in 2019, continuous monitoring of these two parks is critical to assess how the coral-reef ecosystems under two different human-use scenarios respond to repeated heating events and whether there are immediate as well as delayed effects on reef organisms resulting from losses of live coral tissue and a subsequent decrease in structural complexity provided by the coral.

AB  - Hog deer were introduced to Australia in the 1860s, where they have spread across the Gippsland region of Victoria. Due to its status as an introduced species and an important game animal within Victoria, management of the species is complex. Given this complexity, genetic studies can provide important information regarding population structure and diversity which can assist in controlling problematic populations of hog deer, while also ensuring viable game stock in sites managed as game reserves. The aim of this study was to investigate the population genetic structure and diversity of the Victorian hog deer 150 years after introduction using short tandem repeats (STRs). Hog deer samples were collected across 15 sites of differing management regimes in the Gippsland region of Victoria and genotyped for 13 polymorphic STR loci. Up to four distinct genetic clusters were identified across the sites sampled, suggesting that despite low observed genetic diversity, population structure is present across their range. It was also possible to detect evidence of recent translocations among populations. This study suggests that the presence of distinct genetic clusters may enable management of separate genetic units, considering invasive species and game management objectives.

AB  - Large carnivores, including the grey wolf (Canis lupus), play an important role in the carbon cycle through modifying the behaviour and population of wild herbivores. Large carnivores have been eradicated from much of their former range and are now absent from the UK, contributing to increased herbivore populations, which can prevent natural regeneration of trees and woodland. A reintroduction of wolves to the UK could reduce deer populations and associated browsing of tree saplings, but the potential impacts on woodland expansion and carbon sequestration have not been assessed. Here we estimate the impact of a wolf reintroduction in the Scottish Highlands on red deer populations, native woodland colonisation and carbon sequestration. We use a Markov predator-prey model to estimate that a reintroduction would lead to a population of 167 +/- 23 wolves, sufficient to reduce red deer populations below 4 deer km-2, the threshold at which we assume browsing to be sufficiently suppressed to enable natural colonisation of trees. Using a model of potential new native woodlands we estimate the subsequent expansion of native woodland would result in an average annual carbon sequestration of 1.0 +/- 0.1 Mt CO2, with each wolf contributing an annual carbon sequestration of 6080 t CO2. Practical Implication. Our analysis demonstrates the ecosystem benefit that wolves can provide through control of red deer numbers, leading to native woodland expansion. Large-scale expansion of woodlands, facilitated through the return of wolves, can contribute to national climate targets and could provide potential economic benefits to landowners and communities through carbon finance.

AB  - Alpine meadows play a key role in maintaining biodiversity, soil nutrient retention, and herders' livelihoods in mountain regions. Livestock grazing-exclusion is common in grassland management to protect and promote the sustainable use of alpine meadows. However, there are few studies evaluating the effects of traditional light grazing practices in alpine regions and grazing-exclusion impacts on soil nutrient, especially under conditions of climate warming. In this study, we conducted a five-year grazing-exclusion and warming manipulation experiment to examine the effects of grazing-exclusion on soil nitrogen fractions, microbial communities, and enzyme activities under climate warming. Treatments consisted of light-intensity grazing, grazing-exclusion, and combined grazing-exclusion and warming. Our results showed that grazing-exclusion significantly decreased potential nitrogen mineralization at a 0-5 cm depth and at altitudes of 3850 m, 4000 m, 4150 m, and 4250 m. Combined grazing-exclusion and warming also significantly decreased potential nitrogen mineralization at a 0-5 cm depth and at relatively higher altitudes of 4000 m, 4150 m, and 4250 m. Grazing-exclusion, combined grazing-exclusion and warming all shifted microbial communities from bacteria toward fungi. Grazing-exclusion significantly decreased the relative abundances of phylum Chloroflexi (bacteria) and phylum Ascomycota (fungi), while combined grazing-exclusion and warming significantly increased the relative abundances of phylum Basidiomycota (fungi). The relative abundances of phylum Ascomycota (fungi) demonstrated a positive relationship with potential nitrogen mineralization, but the relative abundances of phylum Basidiomycota (fungi) had a negative relationship with potential nitrogen mineralization. The activities of dehydrogenase and protease in grazing-exclusion and combined grazing-exclusion and warming meadows were lower than those in grazed meadows. Our results demonstrated that in the context of climate change and global warming, grazingexclusion is unsuitable as a tool for the sustainable management of alpine meadows from soil nitrogen mineralization and fractions point of view. Of concern, climate warming could potentially amplify the adverse effects of grazing-exclusion and causes depletion of soil nutrients in the alpine meadow. This research suggests that a light-intensity grazing (0.5 yak ha(-1) year(-1)) is beneficial to increase soil enzyme activity and N mineralization in alpine meadows. Our results provide substantial evidence and a useful baseline and guidance for the sustainable grazing management of alpine meadows as environments change due to climate warming in the future.

AB  - Exotic plants are becoming increasingly common worldwide, often driven by ecological factors such as domestic livestock grazing and soil fertilization. In temperate grasslands, native C4 and exotic C3 grasses are generally expected to coexist due to their distinct temporal niches, which should reduce direct competition. However, their differing abilities to exploit limited resources or tolerate vertebrate herbivory can create fitness imbalances, favoring exotic forage species over native species and potentially undermining their long-term coexistence. Few studies have explored how seasonally distinct groups of native and exotic plants interact, especially under the simultaneous manipulation of biotic factors - such as grazing and species interactions - and abiotic factors - such as soil nutrients. We conducted short- and long-term manipulative experiments in a temperate Pampa grassland in Argentina to investigate how herbivore exclusion, fertilization, and their combination influence plant invasion by altering interactions between native warm-season (C4) and exotic cool-season (C3) grasses. Despite their phenological differences, native C4 and exotic C3 grasses interact, and their interactions were weak under grazing. However, with herbivore exclusion and nutrient addition, interactions shifted towards strong competition, particularly in spring. This competition resulted in a slight increase in exotic grass cover over natives after two years. However, fourteen years after the onset of the long-term herbivore exclusion, exotic grasses, particularly Festuca arundinacea, had become dominant, suggesting potential risks to the coexistence of native and exotic species. Our study uniquely reveals that even when niche differentiation is expected to prevent direct competition, biotic and abiotic changes can trigger interactions that favour exotic species' dominance, challenging assumptions about the stability of coexistence between phenologically distinct grasses.

AB  - Grazing exclusion is a common management strategy for improving grasslands degraded due to overgrazing. Although previous meta-analyses proved that grazing exclusion improved soil carbon (C) storage of grasslands in China, we know little about its effect on grassland ecosystems elsewhere and whether litter accumulation induced by grazing exclusion regulates soil C storage. Using meta-analysis, we integrated 91 publications to examine the effects of grazing exclusion on community litter and soil C storage, accompanied by analysis of the regulating roles of body size of herbivore, climatic conditions, and grazing exclusion duration. We found that grazing exclusion enhanced litter biomass and decomposition rate but did not change litter chemical quality. Generally, grazing exclusion enhanced plant production and soil C storage across grassland worldwide. Exclusion of medium and small herbivores had stronger effects on aboveground litter production and soil C storage than exclusion of large herbivores, and grazing exclusion's enhancement on litter production and soil C storage tended to increase as grazing exclusion proceeded. Notably, grazing exclusion-induced increase in aboveground litter biomass was attributed to the increase in biomass of graminoids, while root biomass, not aboveground litter biomass, primarily regulated the increase in soil C storage. The stimulating effect of grazing exclusion on soil C storage was enhanced possibly due to enhanced root biomass response along a precipitation gradient. Generally, our study provided new insights that management practice under grazing exclusion should take plant community dynamics, grazing exclusion duration, preceding grazer type, and climate conditions into account simultaneously.

AB  - Translocations and introductions are important events that allow organisms to overcome natural barriers. The genetic background of colonization success and genetic consequences of the establishment of populations in new environments are of great interest for predicting species' colonization success. The wild boar has been introduced into many parts of the world. We analyzed sequences of the mitochondrial-DNA control region in the wild boars introduced into the Ural region and compared them with sequences from founder populations (from Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Far East). We found that the introduced population has high genetic diversity. Haplotypes from all the major phylogenetic clades were detected in the analyzed group of the animals from the Urals. In this group, no haplotypes identical to Far Eastern sequences were detectable despite a large number of founders from that region. The contribution of lineages originating from Eastern Europe was greater than expected from the proportions (%) of European and Asian animals in the founder populations. This is the first study on the genetic diversity and structure of a wild boar population of mixed origin at the northern periphery of this species' geographical range.

AB  - Reintroduced animals-especially those raised in captivity-are faced with the unique challenge of navigating a wholly unfamiliar environment, and often make erratic or extensive movements after release. Naivete to the reintroduction landscape can be costly, e.g., through increased energy expenditure, greater exposure to predation, and reduced opportunities to forage. Integration with an extant population may provide opportunities for social information transfer. However, in the absence of interactions with residents, it is unclear how individual and social learning may affect an animal's ability to track resources in an unfamiliar landscape. We use integrated step selection functions (iSSFs) to address these knowledge gaps, by evaluating the extent to which environmental factors, individual experience (time since release), and social information-sharing (group size) influence movement decisions by scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah) reintroduced into their native range for the first time in ca. 30 years. We found that both experience and social factors influenced the habitat selection and movement behavior of reintroduced oryx. Of four candidate iSSFs, the model that included environmental, experience, and group size variables performed best in both dry and wet periods. Statistically significant interaction terms between environmental variables and experience were generally larger than similar terms for group size, indicating that experience may affect habitat selection by reintroduced oryx more strongly than social factors. These findings may inform the management of recovering wildlife populations, update widely-held expectations about how released ungulates acclimate to novel landscapes, and demonstrate the utility of long-term monitoring of reintroduced populations.

AB  - In the last years, several wildfires destroyed large areas in Central European forest stands and the risk for fires is predicted to increase in the future. However, little is known about post-fire succession including the effect of forest management for this region. We studied recolonization patterns of natural regeneration of the pioneer tree species Betula pendula Roth (silver birch), Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine), Populus tremula L. (European aspen) and Salix caprea L. (goat willow) on 200 plots in a large, 334 ha burned pine forest stand two years after a severe wildfire. Natural regeneration in general was high, reaching higher densities than artificial regeneration on most plots. The influence of fire severity, post-fire forest management (complete and partial salvage logging and soil disturbance like skidder traffic, ploughing and raking) and distance to the next potential seed source on the number of tree regeneration was tested with multiple linear regression. High fire severities decreased abundance of pine, aspen and willow. The regeneration of all four investigated tree species was influenced by forest management. High birch regeneration was predicted for completely salvage logged plots in combination with skidder traffic or early ploughing and plots without any forest management. Pine regeneration was predicted to be highest on completely salvage logged and sites without any salvage logging. Forest management which in-cludes partial salvage logging showed mostly lower predicted regeneration of birch, pine and aspen as probably an effect of timing. Willow regeneration was promoted by forest management which includes late ploughing. Regeneration of birch and pine decreased with increasing distance to the next potential seed tree, while aspen and willow sapling densities were not affected by distance due to their excellent dispersal by wind. For birch and especially pine, close seed trees are crucial for sufficient natural regeneration. Recolonization of burned areas is a highly dynamic process dependent on several factors. However, natural regeneration provides a fast, cost-effective way of reforestation which can be facilitated by suitable silvicultural treatments. We recommend to keep survived trees as green islands on site to provide close seed sources. To avoid seedling disturbance, forest management activities should be complied according to life cycles of naturally established tree seedlings. We also suggest using the benefits of deciduous pioneer trees in forestry in order to establish more diverse, less fire-prone forests after wildfires in the long term.

AB  - Fishes are conspicuous and threatened components of reef ecosystems. Understanding the role of the variables that shape their assemblages is important to buffer species, fishery stocks, and habitats from anthropogenic threats. So, the influence of depth and topographic complexity on trophic guilds and body size of reef fishes was assessed by underwater visual censuses (UVCs) conducted in biogenic reefs, rocky reefs, and rhodolith beds interspersed with algae, invertebrates, and sand. The study area lies in the southern continental shelf of Espirito Santo state, Brazil, a region that has lacked thorough UVC surveys of biogenic reefs and rhodolith habitats. A total of 105 species belonging to 42 fish families were registered. Among the eight trophic guilds registered, mobile invertebrate feeders and herbivores were the most representative in terms of density and biomass. Biogenic and rocky reefs showed higher biomass, density and richness than rhodolith habitats due to greater topographic complexity, which promotes more food resources and shelter. The five habitats hosted distinct fish assemblages (guilds and taxonomic diversity) probably because of the varying ability of resources they provide. Nevertheless, all habitats were dominated by species of low trophic level. Large fish, especially macrocarnivores, were mostly found in the deepest zones. This pattern is associated with ecological preferences but could also be strengthened by overfishing on shallower sites, decreasing the abundance of top predators and influencing their depth distribution. Our results provide a baseline for future studies, presenting subsidies for the management of human activities and the conservation of marine ecosystems in southeastern Brazil.

AB  - Background Savanna ecosystems constitute approximately 20% of the Earth's terrestrial surface and are increasingly under threat from various factors including effects of climate change. In Baikiaea plurijuga-dominated woodlands of Botswana, the combination of destructive fire regimes and large elephant populations has been cited as a major cause of adverse vegetation changes in African savanna and woodland systems.Aims We assessed the status of fire regimes in Botswana's premium wildlife eco-tourism Chobe region to determine whether market-based fire management could be applied to support broader ecological fire management and employment outcomes.Methods The methods used were: (1) reconstructed fire regimes from the early 1990s coinciding with the cessation of commercial timber exploitation; (2) combined automated MODIS 250 m and manually derived Landsat 30 m burn scar products to generate a 33-year Fire Frequency Index (FFI); (3) classified regional vegetation structural types derived from a 5-year (2021-2024) early dry season Landsat median image; and (4) assessed dry season elephant population density distributions in relation to fire occurrence.Key results Frequent (on average, one in every 2.5 years) and relatively severe late dry season fires were characteristic in more open-canopied legume-dominated savannas and grasslands in the eastern sector of the project area. Elephant distributions in the dry season were independent of fire occurrence. Wildfires plausibly cause relatively greater impacts to Baikiaea-dominated vegetation macro-structure than elephants.Conclusions Multiple factors including national fire exclusion policy contribute to contemporary fire patterning in the Chobe regional landscape.Implications We suggest that carbon market-based approaches have potential for contributing to ecologically sustainable fire management and local employment opportunities.

AB  - Sleeper populations of non-native species can remain at low abundance for decades before irrupting. For over a century, fallow deer (Dama dama) in the island state of Tasmania, Australia, remained at low abundance and close to the region in which they were released. Recently, there are indications the population has increased in abundance and distribution. Here, we spatially quantify the population change using a time series of annual spotlight counts from 1985 to 2019 (up to 172 transects annually, totalling of 5756 transect counts). Next, we predict the potential for further range expansion, using global occurrences to characterise the species' climatic niche, and remote-camera surveys (3225 camera sites) to model fine-grained habitat suitability. Spotlight counts of fallow deer increased by 11.5% annually, resulting in a 40-fold increase from 1985 to 2019. The core distribution increased 2.9-fold during this 35-year period, and now spans c. 27% of Tasmania's land area. Satellite populations have established in locations where farmed deer have escaped or been released, suggesting that humans have facilitated range expansion via new introduction events. Based on climate and habitat suitability, our models predict that 56% of Tasmania is suitable under the current climate. This suggests range expansion is likely to continue unless the population is actively managed, which could include the eradication of satellite populations and containment of core populations. This case study cautions that despite over a century of slow population growth, sleeper populations of non-native species can abruptly increase.

AB  - The expansion of linear infrastructure presents a significant threat to biodiversity, emphasizing the urgent need for regional studies on spatial variations and comprehensive multispecies research. This study surveyed and monitored wildlife passages across eight nature reserves in Xinjiang, evaluating their construction status, utilization patterns, and key factors influencing utilization rates, as well as providing optimization recommendations. The findings revealed that dedicated wildlife passages were scarce, especially in smaller reserves, which primarily relied on small bridges and culverts originally designed for water flow. Enhancing the construction of passages in these areas is strongly recommended. A total of 32 wildlife species were recorded, comprising 13 bird species and 19 mammal species. Ungulates, including bharal (Pseudois nayaur), goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa), Asian wild ass (Equus hemionus), and wild Bactrian camel (Camelus ferus), exhibited high relative abundance indices, indicating a strong preference for utilizing passages. Passage utilization rates exhibited significant seasonal and diurnal variations. Winter usage was the lowest, followed by an increase in spring, peaking in summer and autumn. Birds exhibited particularly high passage utilization rates during migratory seasons, with the peak occurring in April. Additionally, nocturnal passage utilization rates were significantly higher than during other periods, with both sunrise and sunset showing positive selection, as indicated by 86.86% and 91.30% of monitored sites recording JSI > 0. To enhance the effectiveness of passages, seasonal and diurnal variations should be fully considered in passage construction and management, particularly by minimizing human activity during nighttime, dawn, and dusk. Utilization rates were significantly constrained by the intensity of human activity and the density of linear infrastructure. Passage type, size, and proximity to water were also critical factors. Optimizing passage layout, implementing dynamic management in grassland fence areas, increasing passage density, and enhancing ecological functionality are recommended strategies to facilitate wildlife movement and support biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Context. Helicopter-based shooting has been widely used to kill deer in Australasia, but the animal welfare outcomes of this technique have not been evaluated.
   Aim. To assess the animal welfare outcomes of helicopter-based shooting of deer in Australia by quantifying the fates of deer seen and shot at, the duration of procedures and the number and location of bullet wounds in deer.
   Methods. Three deer control operations were assessed. These operations targeted: (1) chital deer (Axis axis) in Queensland, (2) fallow deer (Dama dama) in Australian Capital Territory and (3) fallow deer in New South Wales. For each operation, an independent veterinarian conducted ante-mortem (i.e. from the helicopter as shooting occurred) and post-mortem (i.e. from the ground after shooting had ceased) observations. The ante-mortem data were used to estimate the proportion of deer seen that were shot, chase time (CT), time to insensibility (TTI) and total time (TT; CT thorn TTI). The numbers and locations of bullet wounds were recorded post-mortem.
   Key results. Ante-mortem and post-mortem observations were performed for 114-318 and 60-105 deer, respectively, in the three operations. Shots were fired at 69-76% of deer that were observed. Median CT ranged from 73 to 145 s. Median TTI ranged from 17 to 37 s and median TT ranged from 109 to 162 s. The mean number of bullet wounds per deer ranged from 1.43 to 2.57. Animal welfare outcomes were better in the two fallow deer operations than in the chital deer operation. In both fallow deer operations, most deer were shot multiple times and at least once in the head or thorax. In contrast, chital deer were shot fewer times and less often in the head or thorax, and non-fatal wounding was observed.
   Conclusions. The best animal welfare outcomes were achieved when helicopter-based shooting operations followed a fly-back procedure and mandated that multiple shots were fired into each animal.
   Implications. Animal welfare outcomes for helicopter-based deer shooting in Australia could be improved with a national-level standard operating procedure requiring helicopters to fly back over shot animals and repeatedly shoot animals in the head or thorax.

AB  - Climate change is expected to disproportionately affect species occupying ecosystems with relatively hard boundaries, such as alpine ecosystems. Wildlife managers must identify actions to conserve and manage alpine species into the future, while considering other issues and uncertainties. Climate change and respiratory pathogens associated with widespread pneumonia epidemics in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) may negatively affect mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) populations. Mountain goat demographic and population data are challenging to collect and sparsely available, making population management decisions difficult. We developed predictive models incorporating these uncertainties and analyzed results within a structured decision making framework to make management recommendations and identify priority information needs in Montana, USA. We built resource selection models to forecast occupied mountain goat habitat and account for uncertainty in effects of climate change, and a Leslie matrix projection model to predict population trends while accounting for uncertainty in population demographics and dynamics. We predicted disease risks while accounting for uncertainty about presence of pneumonia pathogens and risk tolerance for mixing populations during translocations. Our analysis predicted that new introductions would produce more area occupied by mountain goats at mid-century, regardless of the effects of climate change. Population augmentations, carnivore management, and harvest management may improve population trends, although this was associated with considerable uncertainty. Tolerance for risk of disease transmission affected optimal management choices because translocations are expected to increase disease risks for mountain goats and sympatric bighorn sheep. Expected value of information analyses revealed that reducing uncertainty related to population dynamics would affect the optimal choice among management strategies to improve mountain goat trends. Reducing uncertainty related to the presence of pneumonia-associated pathogens and consequences of mixing microbial communities should reduce disease risks if translocations are included in future management strategies. We recommend managers determine tolerance for disease risks associated with translocations that they and constituents are willing to accept. From this, an adaptive management program can be constructed wherein a portfolio of management actions are chosen based on risk tolerance in each population range, combined with the amount that uncertainty is reduced when paired with monitoring, to ultimately improve achievement of fundamental objectives.

AB  - The invasive species Bubalus bubalis was introduced in Guapor & eacute; Biological Reserve in 1953. Since then, the buffaloes have become feral, posing a threat to the populations, communities, and natural ecosystems of the region. In the last decade, there has been no study or monitoring of the invasive population and its potential impacts. We utilized systematic flights and multitemporal remote sensing analysis to address (i) What is the distribution range, abundance and density of Asian buffalo in the protected area? (ii) How has this species changed the land scape in the protected area over the past 34 years? The population survey resulted in 4.782 +/- 533.27 buffaloes within 966.22 km(2), population density of 4.9 +/- 0.55 buffaloes per km(2). The study also identified a 51% expansion of occupied areas within the Guapor & eacute; Reserve over the last 10 years. The multitemporal remote sensing analysis revealed significant environmental changes over the years, resulting in 48% loss of naturally flooded areas in the region occupied by buffalo. The government must take urgent measures to develop and implement a plan to control and eradicate this invasive species.

AB  - Grazing has proven to be a successful management tool in terms of the maintenance and restoration of biodiversity. Sheep and pastoralism can provide a various set of ecosystem services, i.e., benefits for humans from the environment. The Silesian Beskids, the westernmost part of the Carpathian Mountains, is an area with a long tradition of pastoralism. Since the 13th century, sheep have grazed clearings located in forests and in large areas of grasslands in mountains. In this study, we tried to identify all possible aspects of provisional, regulating and cultural services provided by sheep and the pasturage tradition bearing in mind the specificity of this region. The biodiversity maintenance and habitat creation due to grazing and the cultural values of pastoralism was illustrated using a literature review of data concerning cultural heritage, tourism and education and using our own phytosociological field studies performed in nine vegetation types within grazing sites. In order to examine the impact of grazing, an observation of sheep's daily grazing activity during the vegetation season using tractive GPS locators was conducted. The results showed that grazing has a positive impact on the maintenance of vegetation including EU-protected habitats. In addition, the pastoral activity introduced to the Beskids by the Vlachs contributed to the development of a specific highlander culture that continues to this day. Not all potential ecosystem services associated with the use of sheep are realized in the study area. Amongst the provisional services, sheep bones are not used while dairy is the most popular followed by meat. In turn, the cultural heritage of pastoralism is one of the most important drivers for the touristic attraction of Silesian Beskid.

AB  - The timing of seedling emergence is strongly linked with fitness because it determines the biotic and abiotic environment experienced by plants in this vulnerable life stage. Experiments and observations consistently find that earlier-emerging plants have a competitive advantage over those emerging later. However, substantial genetic and phenotypic variation in emergence timing is harbored within and among plant populations, making it important to characterize the selective agents-including biotic interactions-that contribute to this variation. In seasonal herbaceous communities, we hypothesized that consumption of early-emerging individuals by vertebrates could weaken the strength of directional selection for earlier emergence in competitive environments. To investigate this, we carried out phenotypic selection analyses on emergence timing in two California grass species, the native Stipa pulchra and non-native Bromus diandrus, growing in intraspecific competitive neighborhoods with and without vertebrate herbivore exclusion. Vertebrate herbivores consistently weakened directional selection for earlier emergence. Our results demonstrate that vertebrate herbivores play an underappreciated selective role on phenology in plant populations, with implications for contemporary evolution, such as the potential of species to adapt to global environmental changes.

AB  - The timing of seedling emergence is strongly linked with fitness because it determines the biotic and abiotic environment experienced by plants in this vulnerable life stage. Experiments and observations consistently find that earlier-emerging plants have a competitive advantage over those emerging later. However, substantial genetic and phenotypic variation in emergence timing is harbored within and among plant populations, making it important to characterize the selective agents-including biotic interactions-that contribute to this variation. In seasonal herbaceous communities, we hypothesized that consumption of early-emerging individuals by vertebrates could weaken the strength of directional selection for earlier emergence in competitive environments. To investigate this, we carried out phenotypic selection analyses on emergence timing in two California grass species, the native Stipa pulchra and non-native Bromus diandrus, growing in intraspecific competitive neighborhoods with and without vertebrate herbivore exclusion. Vertebrate herbivores consistently weakened directional selection for earlier emergence. Our results demonstrate that vertebrate herbivores play an underappreciated selective role on phenology in plant populations, with implications for contemporary evolution, such as the potential of species to adapt to global environmental changes.

AB  - Expanding knowledge of the trophodynamic of ecosystems improves the understanding of energy flow and interactions formed in food webs; therefore, structural knowledge of food webs helps to understand the ecosystem dynamics. This study describes the marine trophic structure of the largest marine protected area (MPA) of the Colombian Pacific in Malpelo Island, using delta 13C and delta 15N. A total of 293 (38 groups/families) samples were collected and analyzed, being mostly represented by teleosts, followed by crustaceans, elasmobranchs, zooplankton, seabirds, and others functional groups. The marine isospace was between -21.5%o and - 10.0%o for delta 13C and between 4.6%o to 16.9%o in delta 15N. The Malpelo Island marine ecosystem showed a food web composed of five trophic levels (TLs): TL -I (primary producers), TL -II (herbivores), TL -III (primary carnivores), TL -IV (secondary carnivores), and TL -V (tertiary carnivores), along with three intermediate TLs (TLs II -III, III -IV, and IV -V). The isotopic diversity index showed global low values of uniqueness (IUni) (0-0.349), intermediate values of IRicGlobal, and IDisGlobal (0.350-0.640), and high values of IDivGlobal, and IEveGlobal (0.650-1). TLs reflected high trophic interaction indices as a result of multifunctionality (12 feeding mechanisms) and possible ontogenetic changes of organisms in this ecosystem. This study includes the first insights into the marine trophic structure of the Malpelo Island and indicate some functional aspects of the entities that inhabit this ecosystem. This study fill information gaps for the MPA and constitute an important tool to improve the elaboration of management and conservation measures based on the knowledge of the ecosystem function.

AB  - Successful conservation efforts have led to recent increases of large mammals such as European bison Bison bonasus, moose Alces alces and grey wolf Canis lupus and their return to former habitats in central Europe. While embraced by some, the recovery of these species is a controversial topic and holds potential for human-wildlife conflicts. Involving the public has been suggested to be an effective method for monitoring wildlife and mitigating associated conflicts. To assess two interrelated prerequisites for engaging people in Citizen Science (CS)-knowledge of returning species and respondents' readiness to participate in CS activities for monitoring and managing these species-we conducted a survey (questionnaire) in two wildlife parks located in different states of Germany. Based on 472 complete questionnaires, we developed generalized linear models to understand how sociodemographic variables and exposure to the species affected visitors' knowledge of each species, and to investigate if sociodemographic variables and knowledge influenced the likelihood of visitors to participate in CS activities. Almost all visitors were aware of the returning wolf population, while knowledge and awareness about bison and moose were significantly lower. Knowledge of the two herbivores differed geographically (higher knowledge of moose in the north-eastern state), possibly indicating a positive association between exposure to the species and knowledge. However, models generally performed poorly in predicting knowledge about wildlife, suggesting that such specific knowledge is insufficiently explained by sociodemographic variables. Our model, which explained stated willingness in CS indicated that younger participants and those with higher knowledge scores in the survey were more willing to engage in CS activities. Overall, our analyses highlight how exposure to large mammals, knowledge about wildlife and human demographics are interrelated-insights that are helpful for effectively recruiting citizen scientists for wildlife conservation.

AB  - Global ecosystems underwent major changes through the Quaternary, as climates cycled from cool and dry glacial conditions to relatively warm and humid interglacial conditions. How these changes affected the diversity and composition of small-mammal communities is mostly unknown, especially for the southern-temperate regions of Australia. We used fossil assemblages from owl regurgitates to investigate changes in small mammals from Tasmania's forest environments over the last 20,000 years, encom-passing the transition from cold glacial conditions of the Last Glacial0 Maximum (LGM) into the warmer Holocene. During the early part of this period, Tasmania was connected to mainland Australia via a low -elevation land bridge, but was transformed into a large island by rising sea levels during the Late Pleistocene -Holocene transition. Despite these changes, the regional small-mammal fauna appears to have been persistent over this entire period, with no loss of species. However, the relative abundance of most species changed dramatically, apparently in response to habitat changes, which also provoked substantial shifts in community composition and diversity. A strong indicator of the magnitude of change is Mastacomys fuscus, a graminivorus specialist murid, which dominated the assemblage prior to and during the LGM, but declined as temperature and sea level rose during the Late Pleistocene -Holocene. In contrast, the generalist rodent Pseudomys higginsi, along with the small forest-dependent marsupials Cercartetus spp. and Antechinus spp., became more common during the Holocene. The continued survival of these species to the present, despite divergent environmental needs, implies that Tasmania's complex geomorphology provided multiple refugia that conferred resilience in the face of environmental change.

AB  - Sea urchins are considered the most important grazers in Mediterranean shallow sublittoral rocky reef ecosystems, but fish can also have an important role in overgrazing and the reduction of habitat complexity. In this study, the trophic behavior of fish was recorded when provided access to experimental surfaces with increased macroalgal biomass and associated benthic fauna, created by herbivore exclusion cages. After a sufficient period for substantial algal growth, the cages were removed and the activity of fish on these surfaces was recorded for 3 h by an automated photographic camera system. Control surfaces with no restriction on grazers were defined on similar substrates for comparison. To quantify the effects of fish feeding activity on macroalgal coverage, photographic samples were taken immediately after the opening of the cages and after each 3 h recording. The response of fish when the cages were removed was immediate and intense. Feeding activity by 13 different fish species was recorded in total, of which the most frequent were the omnivores Diplodus vulgaris, Coris julis and Thalassoma pavo, and to a lesser extent the herbivore Sarpa salpa. The coverage of erect algae was substantially decreased on the experimental surfaces due to fish feeding activity. The algae were either directly consumed by the fish or cut off when the fish were feeding on macroinvertebrates. We conclude that in addition to grazing by herbivores, fish of higher trophic levels can also significantly affect macroalgal assemblages and restrict the recovery of erect algae in overgrazed reefs where prey is scarce.

AB  - Despite many studies that have explored the effect of livestock grazing on plant communities, the response of species composition and diversity to livestock grazing in arid rangelands remains ambiguous. This study examined the effects of livestock grazing on plant communities in arid steppe rangelands of North Africa. Plant diversity of annual species, perennial species, and all species combined were measured and compared between grazed and grazing-excluded areas. We also examined the relative importance of species turnover and community nestedness. Moreover, the effects of livestock grazing on beta diversity at local among transects and landscape among sites scales were examined using the multiplicative diversity partitioning. Results revealed that livestock grazing significantly decreased the alpha diversity of all species combined and the diversity of annual plants. Livestock grazing induced a shift in plant community composition where most species composition variation (similar to 74%) was due to infrequent species replacement 'turnover' between the two management types rather than nestedness (similar to 26%). Results revealed also that among transects, beta diversity was higher in grazed steppes than in grazing-excluded steppes. Whereas, among sites, beta diversity was lower in grazed steppes compared to grazing-excluded steppes. These findings suggest that livestock grazing in arid steppe rangelands increases the variation in plant species composition at a local spatial scale and engenders vegetation homogeneity at a landscape spatial scale. Therefore, the implementation of appropriate management practices such as short-term grazing exclusion is mandatory to prevent these ecosystems from large-scale biotic homogenization.

AB  - Invasive mammals represent a critical threat to island biodiversity; eradications can result in ecological restoration yet may fail in the absence of key population parameters. Over-browsing by invasive Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) is causing severe ecological and cultural impacts across the Haida Gwaii archipelago (Canada). Previous eradication attempts demonstrate forest regeneration upon deer removal, but reinvasion reverses conservation gains. Here we use restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (12,947 SNPs) to investigate connectivity and gene flow of invasive deer (n = 181) across 15 islands, revealing little structure throughout Haida Gwaii and identifying the large, central island of Moresby (>2600 km(2)) as the greatest source of migrants. As a result, the archipelago itself should be considered the primary eradication unit, with the exception of geographically isolated islands like SGang Gwaay. Thus, limiting eradications to isolated islands combined with controlled culling and enhanced biosecurity may be the most effective strategies for achieving ecological restoration goals.
   Genomic data presented in this study provide clues about why previous attempts to eradicate the invasive Sitka black-tailed deer from the Haida Gwaii archipelago in Canada have been incomplete. The authors find substantial gene flow between islands, with the exception of the remote island of SGang Gwaay, which they argue is a viable option for near-term eradication efforts.

AB  - Fences are a common feature throughout the landscape of North America's Great Plains region. Knowledge surrounding the harmful implication that fences have on the movement of wildlife, specifically ungulates, is expanding. Across the region, it is accepted that there is a need to mitigate the impacts of barbed wire fencing and that "wildlife-friendlier" fence designs are emerging as a practical tool to meet these goals. Here we evaluate the response of sympatric deer species to the implementation of two fence modifications, fastening the top two wires together using clips and the installation of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe to encompass the top two wires. We also aim to determine the optimal top wire height to allow for successful crossing by deer, with the goal to provide a more robust understanding of effective wildlife-friendlier fence standards. We used remote trail cameras to capture crossing events and recorded responses for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Using generalized linear mixed modelling, we tested the influence modifications had on crossing success and decisions prior to and after the modifications were installed compared to control sites. We found that these modifications had little impact on deer crossing behavior. We determined that wire height had the greatest impact on the permeability of fences, but that deer permeability was strongly influenced by species and sex. We found that the current maximum recommended top wire height of 102 cm (40 inches) is adequate to allow individuals of both deer species to cross over the fence, with the exception of female mule deer. Our results also indicate as the top wire height reaches 110 cm (43 inches) or higher, that the probability of successfully jumping over the fence dramatically drops off, with the exception for male mule deer. We recommend the installation of clips as a cost-effective method to lower top wire height and PVC pipe to improve fence visibility and potentially reduce entanglement events, all while effectively keeping livestock in intended pastures.

AB  - Nonnative plant invasion is among the most severe environmental threats facing terrestrial ecosystems. When introduced into new regions, nonnative plants are thought to shed adapted herbivores. This enemy release may contribute to plant invasiveness, but it also implies that by hosting fewer herbivores, nonnative plants contribute little to supporting diverse food webs and ecosystem services. However, for many widespread invasive plants, arthropod communities have not been extensively surveyed, limiting our ability to assess their contribution to ecosystems. Here, we report on the caterpillar fauna of an important invasive shrub in the Midwest U.S, Amur Honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). We find that, despite its nonnative status, L. maackii hosts a surprising diversity of caterpillar and sawfly species. We recorded 91 caterpillar species from L. maackii, and though some were likely vagrants, we were able to rear 61 species to pupation on this host. This diversity is similar to that found on common native woody plant genera in the region. The caterpillar community on L. maackii is dominated by generalist Noctuidae, Geometridae, and Erebidae, but also includes species specialized on native relatives. Overall survival was relatively low on L. maackii, suggesting that despite the diverse community we documented, physiological barriers may hamper its colonization by native herbivores. Size at collection, date and caterpillar family all significantly affected the likelihood of caterpillar survival on L. maackii. Our results provide a foundation for understanding the ecological impacts of L. maackii on insect herbivore communities and the processes by which invasive plants are integrated into local food webs.

AB  - Subtropical coral reefs such as the lagoonal reefs of Norfolk Island in the remote South Pacific are vastly understudied, with many benthic species unrecorded in the scientific literature. Here we report on ascidian populations from 2021 to 2023 at Norfolk Islands inshore reefs. Quantitative assessments spanning that period were conducted to assess ascidian presence, cover, and benthic interactions. We show ascidian cover remained persistently low and stable across the lagoonal reefs during the study period. We find adjacent reef site, Cemetery Bay showed variation in ascidian cover over time, where we measure a 3.2-fold increase in cover over 2 years. Ascidians were associated primarily with sand and sediment substrates at all reef locations. Recorded interactions between hard corals and ascidians were low. This study provides valuable insights into the population dynamics of ascidians within subtropical reef ecosystems. Ongoing ascidian population monitoring can provide a comprehensive understanding of ascidian dynamics whilst also providing insight of theimpact of anthropogenic stressors on benthic communities. Together, this can aid in informing management and conservation strategies for subtropical reefs.

AB  - Wisent Bison bonasus is an example of a species saved from extinction and reintroduced into nature after a few decades of captive breeding. There were only twelve founders of the Lowland-Caucasian line (LC) and even fewer (seven out of twelve) of Lowland (LB) animals. The genetic diversity in studies based on pedigree or markers is very low. In this paper, we present a summary of the long-term genetic monitoring conducted for the worldwide population of European bison. We summarized the long-term genetic monitoring studies conducted on the worldwide population of wisents to date. We genotyped 2227 wisents from two genetic lines (LC and LB) and different populations at ten microsatellite loci. We found low polymorphism, with only 2.7 alleles per locus, and much lower values of observed heterozygosity (0.380 and 0.348 in the LC and LB lines, respectively) than expected heterozygosity. The difference between the lines is only noticeable in allele proportions, so the number of markers is not enough to distinguish the two genetic lines. We also present the genetic distance among four free-roaming populations that are geographically close to each other. We found that the genetic distance of one of them is larger than that of the others, which could be the effect of genetic drift.

AB  - Bycatch is one of the main causes of mortality among marine megafauna around the world. In the coastal waters of southern Brazil, bycatch in gillnet fisheries affects threatened species that use this region as a breeding and feeding area. The identification of hotspot areas of bycatch is necessary to design and prioritize efficient spatial-temporal closures that protect the largest possible number of threatened species of marine megafauna. In this context, the use of a multispecies approach is an important step towards planning effective fisheries management measures. This study has two main objectives: (1) to identify hotspot areas of bycatch in gillnet fisheries for the most threatened marine megafauna species on the continental shelf of Rio Grande do Sul (RS); (2) compare single species and multispecies mapping methods for the identification of these areas. To meet these objectives, data collected by onboard observers during fishing trips in the coastal commercial RS-based gillnet fleet between 2013 and 2015 and between 2018 and 2020 were analyzed. For the identification of the areas, hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal models were implemented, using monospecific and multispecific approaches and a weighting system for the conservation status of the species. Both approaches provide similar results, identifying three bycatch hotspots according to the time frame analysed. Based on our findings, we propose these areas as the top candidates for fishing exclusion zones, based on their biodiversity value. The suggested spatio-temporal closures would benefit several endangered species while also contributing to the recovery of fish populations.

AB  - A negative dependence of the digestibility of grassland vegetation on the amount of grasses in the feed consumed, which is in turn associated with an increased content of silicon compounds in grasses, is found. Using the example of four species of herbivores (Przewalski's horse, American bison, Bactrian camel, and saiga), which differ in the specifics of digestion, the selectivity of their nutrition was studied in relation to two groups of plants differing in digestibility-grasses and forbs. Saigas, like other obviously highly selective consumers of easily digestible food, strictly select forbs with a low silicon content and high digestibility. With the dominance of low-digestible grasses on the grassland and their forced consumption, the saiga population is not viable. Horses and bison, like other representatives of equines and large ruminants, due to the characteristics of the digestive system, are able to assimilate low-digestible grass feeds successfully and are highly specialized in feeding on grasses. The exclusion of forbs from the diet of horses and bison is associated with the increased toxicity of this group of plants. Camels do not discriminate in the choice of grasses and forbs of different nutritional value and currently actively use fallow areas (on former arable land) dominated by weedy plants, which are avoided by other herbivores. Different specialization in the choice of forage plants when different species of animals graze together causes their division in the use of grassland feed resources, eliminates competition between them, and acts as a necessary factor in preserving the species diversity of grassland vegetation.

AB  - Ongoing support for an eradication program depends on clear information being provided to on-ground operational and managerial personnel and funding agencies about the performance of control effort. This paper describes the methods used to track the success of control activities during goat eradication on Kangaroo Island, Australia, from 2006 to 2017. A range of techniques were used during the program to monitor the goat population, including helicopter surveys, Judas goats, walking transects, camera trapping, scat count transects, and opportunistic community observations. A Bayesian catch-effort model contained within a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet enabled data from multiple monitoring techniques to be accommodated. The familiar spreadsheet format made it relatively easy for operational staff to add data and visualize the strength of individual or combined monitoring techniques to track population decline. This provided greater incentive to maintain accurate records of hunting and survey effort during the eradication program. Combined survey effort data indicated there was a 1% chance that feral goats remained extant at the beginning of 2017. This probability was reduced to 0.1% if in another 12 months no further feral goat activity was detected by hunting effort and landholder/manager monitoring.

AB  - Increases in sea surface temperature impact animal metabolism, which in turn could influence benthic structure and resulting algal-coral balance. We utilized a long-term coral reef dataset from the west coast of Hawai'i Island to investigate impacts of annual positive and negative sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) on benthic cover [algal turf, macroalgae, crustose coralline algae (CCA), and coral], herbivore density (sea urchins, grazers, browsers, and scrapers) and the relationship between benthic cover and herbivore density. Results showed significantly lower coral cover, but higher CCA cover with positive SSTA. Additionally, the density of sea urchins, grazers and browsers increased with increasing SSTA. Warming disrupted the normal relationship between herbivores and benthic cover on reefs, particularly for grazers where higher densities were coupled with lower algal turf cover only during negative SSTA. The direction of the relationship between benthic cover and herbivore type changed with positive SSTA, where increased algal turf cover was associated with increased herbivore density. Here, herbivores are likely responding accordingly to increases in food availability due to increased metabolism under warming. Despite herbivore populations increasing in density over the past two decades, algal turf cover remains on an upward trajectory. These results indicate that warming can alter herbivore-algal dynamics, where greater herbivore densities may be required to cause a reduction in algal turf cover. Protection of herbivores in addition to reducing nutrient input onto reefs will be essential in driving a reduction in algal turf cover on Hawaiian reefs.

AB  - Following an incidental observation of captive Clibanarius corallinus () supposedly removing algae from each other's shells, we conducted a feeding experiment over 72 hours to understand its potential role as a mesograzer in coral reef ecosystems. Epiphyte-covered, coral rubble fragments of Acropora spp. were exposed to hermit crab (N = 41) activity for 72 h in a flow-through seawater aquarium system at Heron Island, southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia to understand whether hermit crabs could remove epilithic algae and if so, to what extent. Coral fragments exposed to the hermit crabs had 9.1% less chlorophyll at the end of the experiment. The detritus generated in the experimental set-up had 2.4 times more chlorophyll and 33.4% less organic biomass than the detritus generated in the control environment. The crabs did on average lose 0.11 g of their initial weight, which could have been a consequence of the experimental set-up. These results suggest that C. corallinus has the potential to contribute to the control of epilithic algae in coral reefs, with such effect having hitherto been overlooked as a result of the cryptic behaviour of this hermit crab species.

AB  - The study of interspecific interactions helps scientists and conservationists understand the ability of species to coexist in a given area, improving the conservation and management of ecological communities. Here we present a case study where we tested whether spatial and temporal interactions of whitetailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), an ungulate native to Costa Rica, and horses (Equus caballus), a domestic ungulate reintroduced to a protected area, might result in avoidance. We used a paired field design with 40 camera traps deployed in two adjacent 228-ha fields within northwestern dry forest of Costa Rica during the wet season. We used general linear models to evaluate the effect of horse presence and vegetation type on white-tailed deer spatial distribution, as well as the Pianka's index to assess evidence of spatial overlapping. In addition, temporal overlap between horses and deer was assessed using the overlap coefficient, and the temporal response of white-tailed deer to horse presence was assessed using a spatially explicit null model approach. Evidence indicated that white-tailed deer used sites with horses more than sites without horses and used grass and shrubland sites more than forested sites. Within the area with horses, spatial overlap between horses and white-tailed deer was intermediate, suggesting insights of a moderate degree of spatial partitioning. Horses and white-tailed deer both showed similar activity patterns with a high degree of overlap, but our null model approach suggested neutral interaction; thus, our results indicated non-negative effects of horse presence on white-tailed deer spatiotemporal activity. Our results are limited by spatial and temporal replication, so caution is recommended when using this information to make decisions in other sites where horses and deer coexist.

AB  - Past research has demonstrated how local-scale human impacts-including reduced water quality, overfishing, and eutrophication-adversely affect coral reefs. More recently, global-scale shifts in ocean conditions arising from climate change have been shown to impact coral reefs. Here, we surveyed benthic reef communities at 34 U.S.-affiliated Pacific islands spanning a gradient of oceanic productivity, temperature, and human habitation. We re-evaluated patterns reported for these islands from the early 2000s in which uninhabited reefs were dominated by calcifiers (coral and crustose coralline algae) and thought to be more resilient to global change. Using contemporary data collected nearly two decades later, our analyses indicate this projection was not realized. Calcifiers are no longer the dominant benthic group at uninhabited islands. Calcifier coverage now averages 26.9% +/- 3.9 SE on uninhabited islands (compared to 45.18% in the early 2000s). We then asked whether oceanic productivity, past sea surface temperatures (SST), or acute heat stress supersede the impacts of human habitation on benthic cover. Indeed, we found variation in benthic cover was best explained not by human population densities, but by remotely sensed metrics of chlorophyll-a, SST, and island-scale estimates of herbivorous fish biomass. Specifically, higher coral and CCA cover was observed in more productive waters with greater biomass of herbivores, while turf cover increased with daily SST variability and reduced herbivore biomass. Interestingly, coral cover was positively correlated with daily variation in SST but negatively correlated with monthly variation. Surprisingly, metrics of acute heat stress were not correlated with benthic cover. Our results reveal that human habitation is no longer a primary correlate of calcifier cover on central Pacific island reefs, and highlight the addition of oceanic productivity and high-frequency SST variability to the list of factors supporting reef builder abundance.

AB  - Climate change is increasing the frequency of droughts and the risk of severe wildfires, which can interact with shrub encroachment and browsing by wild ungulates. Wild ungulate populations are expanding due, among other factors, to favorable habitat changes resulting from land abandonment or land-use changes. Understanding how ungulate browsing interacts with drought to affect woody plant mortality, plant flammability, and fire hazard is especially relevant in the context of climate change and increasing frequency of wildfires. The aim of this study is to explore the combined effects of cumulative drought, shrub encroachment, and ungulate browsing on the fire hazard of Mediterranean oak woodlands in Portugal. In a long-term (18 years) ungulate fencing exclusion experiment that simulated land abandonment and management neglect, we investigated the population dynamics of the native shrub Cistus ladanifer, which naturally dominates the understory of woodlands and is browsed by ungulates, comparing areas with (no fencing) and without (fencing) wild ungulate browsing. We also modeled fire behavior in browsed and unbrowsed plots considering drought and nondrought scenarios. Specifically, we estimated C. ladanifer population density, biomass, and fuel load characteristics, which were used to model fire behavior in drought and nondrought scenarios. Overall, drought increased the proportion of dead C. ladanifer shrub individuals, which was higher in the browsed plots. Drought decreased the ratio of live to dead shrub plant material, increased total fuel loading, shrub stand flammability, and the modeled fire parameters, that is, rate of surface fire spread, fireline intensity, and flame length. However, total fuel load and fire hazard were lower in browsed than unbrowsed plots, both in drought and nondrought scenarios. Browsing also decreased the population density of living shrubs, halting shrub encroachment. Our study provides long-term experimental evidence showing the role of wild ungulates in mitigating drought effects on fire hazard in shrub-encroached Mediterranean oak woodlands. Our results also emphasize that the long-term effects of land abandonment can interact with climate change drivers, affecting wildfire hazard. This is particularly relevant given the increasing incidence of land abandonment.

AB  - Due to the vulnerability of neonatal ungulates, selection of a birth site can have important implications for offspring survival and thus fitness of the mother. We studied parturition site selection in cow Elk in southeastern Kentucky, United States, using a use-availability framework to evaluate the effects of landscape variables sampled at multiple spatial grains on the relative probability of use of parturition sites. We identified 81 Elk parturition sites during May-Aug 2020-2022 and fit several candidate resource selection function models using a sample of 24,314 random locations to characterize habitat availability. Using an information-theoretic approach to rank candidate models, we identified two top-performing models (cumulative wi = 0.97), which indicated that at fine spatial grains (-10-and 30-m pixels) parturient cow Elk selected for intermediate canopy cover and lower terrain ruggedness compared to available locations. At coarse grains (250-1,000-m buffers/neighborhoods), Elk selected against vegetation greenness/biomass, for higher topographic positions, for closer proximity to major roads, and with higher solar radiation potential. We also found evidence that Elk responded positively to forest/open edge densities at coarse grains, demonstrating that calving habitat throughout the Kentucky Elk Restoration Zone is associated with heterogeneous landscapes resulting from surface mine reclamation. As a result, habitat management actions should aim to increase patchy, early successional shrub cover on gentle topography.

AB  - Even though there is extensive research on the rocky reefs in the Gulf of California, some areas still have scarce information, such as the Farall & oacute;n de San Ignacio, which is well known for its high biodiversity and its location in the biogeographic transition zone known as the "Sinaloa gap." Due to the limited information available for this site, the present study aimed to describe the composition and structure of asteroid and echinoid fish assemblages at the Farall & oacute;n de San Ignacio. For this purpose, visual surveys were conducted in November 2016 using belt transects of 25 m long by 4 m wide for fish and 25 m long by 2 m wide for invertebrates, to estimate species abundance, richness, diversity, and evenness indices, and to compare them with other rocky reefs located at the same latitude on the western coast of the Gulf of California that were visited the same year. A total of 34 species were recorded, including two asteroids and four echinoids. The most abundant species were the fish Azurina atrilobata, the starfish Phataria unifacialis, and the sea urchin Diadema mexicanum. Despite the Farall & oacute;n's isolation, the complexity of its community structure is similar to that of other islands in the Gulf of California, although there were differences in species composition due to the high abundance of herbivorous species at this site.

AB  - Sea urchins are keystone herbivores in coral reefs that can prevent coral-algae phase shifts and promote coral resilience in the Caribbean. However, knowledge of sea urchin populations in the Indo- Pacific region is less extensive and their role in marine ecosystems remains uncertain. To fill this knowledge gap, this study examined the spatial distribution and species-habitat association of sea urchins in Peninsular Malaysia as a first step in exploring their potential for promoting reef resilience. Firstly, geographical information on the population characteristics of sea urchins in Peninsular Malaysia (Sunda Shelf and Malacca Strait Marine Ecoregions) was gathered. Using literature, questionnaire, and field surveys, ten species of sea urchins from six families were identified in the species record for Peninsular Malaysia. Prionocidaris bispinosa represents the first record for Malaysia, documented in the intertidal seagrass meadow at Tanjung Kupang, Johor. Combining density data from literature and field surveys, sea urchin density for Peninsular Malaysia was estimated to be 46.94 +/- 66 individuals/100 m2. Secondly, the species-habitat association of Diadema setosum and Echinothrix calamaris were determined in belt-transect surveys (n=57), with transects laid parallel to shore at Pulau Rawa, Johor. Multivariate regression analysis identified D. setosum to be more associated with live coral cover and coral growth form, while E. calamaris distribution was driven by habitat rugosity, water depth and live coral cover. These findings suggest contrasting species-habitat associations for the two co-existing species. Given the limited information about sea urchins in Malaysia, this study appears to be the first in-depth study of its kind in the country, deepening our knowledge of sea urchin distribution and the importance of habitat in shaping that distribution. This baseline data serves as valuable information in the planning and management of natural habitats for biodiversity and conservation in Malaysia's marine ecosystem.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Food provides essential nutrients and energy for wildlife and directly influences the compositional patterns of the gut microbiota in natural reservoirs. Little is known about the interspecific differences and correlations between diet and microbial communities in sympatric herbivores. We conducted chloroplast trnL and 16S rRNA genes amplicon sequencing of 90 faecal samples from sika deer (Cervus nippon kopschi), Reeve's muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi), and a Chinese hare (Lepus sinensis). Diet analysis revealed that sika deer predominantly foraged on Rubus (36.5 %), Loropetalum (25.5 %), and Eurya (13.4 %) at the genus level; Reeve's muntjac favoured Rubus (51.8 %), Eurya (11.0 %), and Euonymus (6.1 %); Chinese hare showed dominance in Rubus (15.8 %), Smilax (15.6 %), and Rhus (10.6 %) consumption, with all these forage plants being shrubs. The gut microbiota of the three herbivores was characterised by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria, although the relative abundances of these taxa differed across herbivore species. Alpha diversity indicated no significant differences between sika deer and Reeve's muntjac, whereas alpha indices showed significant differences between sika deer and Chinese hare (p < 0.05). Beta diversity analysis indicated significant differences between the Chinese hare and sika deer, as well as between the Chinese hare and Reeve's muntjac (p < 0.05), with no significant difference found between the two cervid species, which may be attributed to the influence of interspecific genetics and evolutionary factors. Due to seasonal shifts, the food availability for herbivores decreased, resulting in the convergent adaptation of shrubs consumed by the three species. Furthermore, PICRUSt functional profile prediction indicated that the gut microbiota of the three species were mainly enriched in metabolic functions. Mantel correlation analysis suggested that the gut microbiota of sika deer showed a significant positive correlation with five genera of plants, one genus of Reeve's muntjacs, and three genera of Chinese hare (p < 0.01), suggesting that the gut microbiota of sika deer may be more susceptible to changes in food abundance. Our study emphasises how the winter climate affects the foraging strategies and microbial communities of the three herbivores, as well as their correlations. These results may further contribute to the food selection, regulation of gut microbiota, disease prevention, conservation, and management of sika deer and other sympatric herbivores.

AB  - The Hawaiian Islands have long been seen as relatively devoid of native toxic plant species, a result of the paucity of herbivorous predators in this biogeographically isolated archipelago. This assertion has been subjective, without quantitative comparison to floras that evolved in the presence of such predators. We test this assertion by comparing the richness of toxic species in the native flora of the main Hawaiian Islands to that in the naturalized flora of these islands. That test shows the assertion to be correct: the relative abundance of toxic plant species in the naturalized Hawaiian flora is nearly ten times greater than the relative abundance of those species in the Hawaiian native flora. Of the approximately 150 toxic plant species now found in these islands, 92% are naturalized. The species richness of both native and naturalized Hawaiian plant species correlates positively with island size, as does the richness of toxic native and toxic naturalized plant species. These results, and the lack of significant residuals in species-area relationships across the main Hawaiian Islands, suggest that the relative youth of Hawaii Island is not needed to account for native plant species richness on this island.

AB  - Fire directly impacts soil properties responsible for soil function and can result in soil degradation. Across the globe, climate change-induced droughts and elevated temperatures are exacerbating fire regime severity, breadth, and frequency, thus posing a threat to soil function and dependent ecosystem services. In Australia, the 2019-2020 fire season consumed nearly 50% of Kangaroo Island, South Australia, burning both dry sclerophyll woodland and adjacent historically cleared and grazed pastureland. Due to exacerbated fire regime elements, e. g., intensity and area affected, and interactions with historical land use, post-fire recovery of soil function was uncertain. This study assessed the impacts of a) the 2019-2020 fire event in Western River, Kangaroo Island on dry sclerophyll woodland and b) the interaction between this fire event and historical clearing and grazing on post-fire function of the soil. To do so, the following physicochemical and biological soil properties were analysed: labile active carbon, total carbon, total nitrogen, carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N), pH, electrical conductivity, soil water repellency, aggregate stability, microbial community composition, and microbial diversity. Our results showed that the fire was of high severity, causing a reduction in nutrient content, an extreme rise in pH, and significant modifications to fungal communities in burnt compared to unburnt dry sclerophyll woodland. Furthermore, clearing and grazing raised post-fire soil nutrient levels and soil microbial diversity but reduced soil C/N and the abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi in burnt pastureland compared to burnt woodland soils. This study highlights the role of management and fire severity in post-fire outcomes and emphasizes the need for comprehensive soil function assessments to evaluate the impacts of disturbance on soil. Taking direct measure of soil properties, as done here, will improve future assessments of fire season impacts and post-fire recovery in fireprone landscapes.

AB  - Here we describe the methods and results for biological characterization of the benthos on a previously unexplored area of central California, USA seafloor. We conducted 40 remotely operated vehicle dives from 371 to 1173 m water depth. Seafloor habitats and megafauna (fish and invertebrates) were documented from 46.8 km of seafloor video footage. Our expanded development and analysis of biotopes from quantitative data allowed us to describe detailed biological communities, along with the physical characteristics and habitat associations within the study area. This method provides a framework for potential monitoring, detection of future environmental change (natural and anthropogenic) and comprehensive comparison to other deep water regions. From 185 h of observational video at 25 sites, nearly 120,000 annotations of organisms, habitat characters, biological detritus and anthropogenic debris were recorded and analyzed. We identified a total of 228 taxa, with 173 of them present on linear quantitative transects. Species richness for transects ranged from 0.04 to 0.28 m(-2) (8-55 taxa), with densities ranging from 0.07 to 5.20 ind. m(-2). Both were highest on hard substrate with greatest surface area. Densities decreased with depth. Within soft substratum zones was a large field of pockmarks, which are seafloor depressions averaging 175 m in diameter and 5 m in depth. Pockmarks have sometimes been associated with seafloor gas seepage, but here we found no biological evidence of chemosynthetic organisms. No significant differences were found in either density nor species richness at pockmark sites vs. non-pockmark sites. Mud draped greenish-black coarse sand occurred only in low oxygen areas, while hummocky, rugose mud supported somewhat different species than flat mud plains. Seventy percent of the transects occurred inside the oxygen minimum zone. We conclude that high rugosity, slope, and the presence of hard substratum were better predictors of species richness and density than oxygen concentration in this specific study. Abundant biological detritus, in the form of dead and dying pelagic pyrosomes and salps, created a large, presumably ephemeral flux of carbon to the seafloor during the study period.

AB  - Introduction With increasing human activities, the area affected by humans increases annually and many wild animals are under threat of extinction. On the other hand, there are serious conflicts between human and many wildlife. In order to mitigate conflicts, it is important to understand how animals perceive the balance of benefits and risks in human-inhabited areas and how they use the land. In this study, we investigated how African forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis), which are in serious conflict with humans, use anthropogenic environments by focusing on their trails.Methods This study targeted two parameters of anthropogenic environments: vegetation, particularly savannas, which have been maintained by human burning for many years, and population density, particularly in low-density seminatural land. Within Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon, and an adjacent village, we mapped elephant trails and compared their density and structure between vegetation (forest and savanna) and areas (inside and outside the national park).Results In the forest, only 31.4% of the elephant trails were well-established with exposed ground. In the savanna, the density of elephant trails was lower than that in the forest; however, the trails were narrower and 65% of the trails were well established. This suggests that elephants tend to follow specific routes in the savanna that may help them travel more easily, and that they are perceiving some risks. The density of elephant trails outside the national park was higher, and the trails were wider than those in the national park, suggesting frequent elephant use. This was probably due to the crop fields and mango trees attracting elephants.Discussion In the study area, available food may be a greater attractant to elephants relative to the risk of being threatened by humans. The findings show that elephant trail surveys can be carried out inexpensively over a short period of time. Moreover, they can clarify land use by elephant populations, including fine-scale heterogeneous movements.

AB  - Unlike most feral domestic animals, ranging behavior, diet dependence, and human socialization have been used as criteria to define feral dogs. These criteria can obstruct wildlife conservation if decisions depend on identifying ferality in dogs. We argue that diet dependence and human socialization are unnecessary to define ferality in situations where dogs constitute a threat to wildlife. Human-dependent diet and sociability are not exclusive to house dogs; thus, they do not differentiate ferality with certainty, and they have no established testing methods or thresholds. Most notably, they obstruct management by complicating feral dog identification. As a case study, legislation in Chile surrounding dog management does not recognize the existence of feral dogs and bans the application of lethal methods on dogs. This impairs conservation because the current definition makes it impossible to distinguish if a dog is feral at first sight. This is a problem in the small-scale livestock industry, where goat and sheep losses are mainly caused by dogs. Stakeholders could kill attacking dogs to defend their livestock, risking a lawsuit if those dogs were owned, or continue to lose their livelihood. Neither option benefits livestock owners. To not hinder conservation, we propose feral dogs be defined based only on ownership status, ranging behavior, and location in the context of management, and offer a classification based on these criteria. However, we contend that whether a dog is feral is not important for decision-making. Instead, dogs should be controlled if they are found on any public space unaccompanied by humans.

AB  - In this study, the long-term restoration success of calcareous grasslands was investigated using a functional trait approach. The study site is located in the Swabian Alb, Germany, where a former calcareous grassland patch was restored in the 1990s by clearance of a spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) afforestation and subsequent reintroduction of sheep grazing as mobile dispersal vector. Vegetation development was monitored over a period of 25 years, both on the restored and an adjacent never afforested ancient grassland which is still managed by traditional sheep grazing. Changes in the functional composition of fifteen ecological meaningful traits were investigated by comparing the respective attribute expressions of the restored with the ancient reference grassland for each year of observation. A RLQ-analysis was conducted in order to identify plant functional groups. The comparison of attribute expressions showed that differences between restored and ancient grassland decreased rapidly over time. The greatest differences were found in persistence-related traits (e.g., life span and growth form) while dispersal- and establishmentrelated traits recovered faster. The clustering of plant functional groups showed similarities with Grime's CSR-strategy, as cluster analysis grouped species with either ruderal, competitive or stress-tolerant trait attributes. 20 years after restoration, stress-tolerators dominated, while the ruderal cluster could not longer be detected and only a small group of competitive, mostly woody species remained. In 2018, RLQ analysis revealed no differences in the functional composition between restored and ancient grassland. The quick functional recovery is most likely attributed to the reestablishment of the traditional low-intensive grazing management but also to the close vicinity of the ancient grassland as no spatial isolation prevented dispersal of plant species. Hence, the functional trait approach showed that restoration by clearance and subsequent sheep grazing was a suitable management in our study.

AB  - High herbivore abundances on trees surrounded by distantly related neighbors (phylogenetic isolation) might in part be due to local adaptation of herbivores to host trees, but this has not been tested. We studied if free-feeding and semi-concealed (shelter-building) Lepidoptera can be adapted to leaf traits of individual trees, and if this is affected by phylogenetic isolation. We performed a reciprocal transplant experiment on free-feeding and semi-concealed lepidopteran caterpillars collected from oak trees (Quercus petraea) in a mixed forest in Poland. Within a set of trees with early and a set with late budburst, we selected oak trees that varied from being surrounded by other oak trees (low phylogenetic isolation) to oaks surrounded by pine trees (high phylogenetic isolation), and collected canopy branches to obtain caterpillars. We then fed half of the caterpillars leaves from the tree they were collected from (home tree) and others on the leaves of another tree in the set (away trees) in the laboratory. We measured caterpillar mass over a five-day interval to calculate growth rate and determined aspects of leaf chemistry of each tree. Five species of Lepidoptera (Acrobasis repandana, Eudemis profundana, Operopthera brumata, Phycita roborella, Zeiraphera isertana) yielded sufficient sample sizes for statistical analyses. Overall, we found faster growth on home trees, which could be attributed to one species, E. profundana. There was no effect of phylogenetic isolation. Our results indicate that local adaptation to leaf traits of individual trees is rare in these lepidopterans, and we found no evidence that local adaptation would be more pronounced on trees that are more phylogenetically isolated from their neighbors. Therefore, the effects phylogenetic isolation on herbivory are not likely to be mediated by local adaptation to individual trees.

AB  - Management of invasive alien species is a high priority for biodiversity conservation. Here, we studied the effects of glyphosate application, at 0.06 g/m(2) concentration, on physiologically integrated basal and apical ramets of the invasive clonal plant Carpobrotus edulis. Physiological integration allows the transport of resources and other substances between connected ramets in clonal plants. We found a significant reduction of growth and photochemical efficiency both in basal and apical ramets of C. edulis after glyphosate application. Interestingly, we also observed a significant growth reduction in untreated basal ramets when they remained connected to apical ramets treated with glyphosate. This result was interpreted as a cost for basal ramets due to supporting severely stressed apical ramets. Therefore, local application of glyphosate to apical ramets of C. edulis can negatively affect not only their own growth, but also the growth of their interconnected, untreated basal ramets. Our results suggest that glyphosate effectiveness can be maintained when applied only to one part of the clone so that the amount of herbicide used in eradication programs can be greatly reduced, which can minimize the negative impact of chemical herbicides on ecosystems.

AB  - Trees have a great value in terms of ecosystem services in urban areas. LIFE CLIVUT is an "Information and Governance" European project developed in 4 Mediterranean Cities, with the goal of increasing the knowledge and awareness of citizens, especially young people, on the importance of the presence and good management of urban trees to mitigate the "Heat Island" effects. The data collected on the value of tree heritage and their future potential are used to design a green asset management strategy that will help urban planners adopt better practices for the mitigation of the effects of climate change in urban environments. This paper illustrates the results of tree census activity in four urban green areas of Perugia, Central Italy, that will be compared with those recorded in others cities involved in the project. Dendrometric parameters (diameter at breast height, tree height, first branch height, max and min crown width, crown shape and density) were recorded in situ using a dedicated software operating through a web app ("Clivut-Treedb"). The following ecosystem services were estimated: CO2 sequestration, particulate matter (PM) absorption, shadow effect, biodiversity indexes. Several tree species characterized by important wood structures during their adult phase, such as Pinus pinea, Quercus ilex, Q. pubescens, Ulmus carpinifolia, Populus alba and Aesculus hippocastanum showed the highest estimates of CO2 stored. Q. ilex was the most efficient species in particulate adsorption, showing similar estimates (about 60 g PM10 tree(-1) year(-1)) in the 3 oldest green areas established in the 1980s, while the youngest plantations (dating back to 2005) absorbed about 10 g tree(-1) of PM10 per year. In terms of the potential cooling effect of trees, preliminary estimates of the shaded areas highlighted the difference between the older green areas (about 50% of shading) compared to the younger ones (about 15% and 8%).

AB  - The protobranch Aequiyoldia eightsii is one of the most common bivalves in Antarctica and for the first time, its population structure was studied in Admiralty Bay, an Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA), to establish a baseline for future monitoring. Density, size structure, length-weight relationship, condition index, and shell morphometry were evaluated at the shallow coastal zone of the bay. High abundance values of A. eightsii were related to sites with greater contributions of mud particles and total organic carbon contents in the sediment, while the condition indexes were higher in Martel Inlet, possibly due to higher food availability. Individuals obtained from gravel-rich sediments were significantly larger than compressed, while rounded forms were observed in sandy and muddy bottoms of the bay. Positive allometric growth was reported in most sites, except Botany Point, where specimens presented an isometric growth. The results demonstrated that the sediment composition and its organic content influence the population structure of A. eightsii as well as biological factors such as predation and recruitment rates. It is also worth noting that the phenotypic shell variability observed for this protobranch species in geographically close sites (hundreds of meters) highlights the importance of local-scale heterogeneity to be considered in future monitoring programmes for Antarctic marine ecosystems.

AB  - Introduction. Tuberculosis (TB) is a widespread disease known to affect livestock and wildlife, as well as humans. However, its incidence in wildlife remains poorly recognized on the global level. In Europe, the majority of TB cases have been confirmed in red deer, badgers and wild boar. Objective. The aim of the study was to examine the occurrence of TB in Cervidae in Poland, in areas where TB has been detected in cattle and wildlife. Materials and method Head and thoracic lymph nodes were collected from a total of 76 free-living red deer (Cervus elaphus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), from nine Polish provinces during a single hunting season (autumn - winter 2018-19). Samples were subjected to conventional microbiological procedures to isolate mycobacteria. Results. No Mycobacteria was isolated in the material collected from red or roe deer. Conclusions. There is a need to continue monitoring the presence of TB in cattle and other animal species to ensure the protection of public health.

AB  - As wild areas disappear and agricultural lands expand, understanding how people and wildlife can coexist becomes increasingly important. Human-wildlife conflicts (HWCs) are obstacles to coexistence and negatively affect both wildlife populations and the livelihood of people. To facilitate coexistence, a number of frameworks have been developed to both understand the drivers of conflict and then to find solutions that mitigate conflict. However, each framework has different foci and strengths in particular stages of analysis. Here, we propose an integrated framework that leverages the individual strengths of previously fairly isolated methodologies, allowing for holistic HWC analysis. The framework for participatory impact assessment (FoPIA) provides a toolset for developing wildlife scenarios, selecting assessment indicators and assessing the impact of different scenarios. The social-ecological framework of ecosystem services and disservices (SEEDS) analyzes the ecosystem services trade-offs related to scenarios, and the 3i stakeholder analysis approach, supports the identification of stakeholders and provides a mechanism to explore, in detail stakeholders' interests, relative influence, and how outcomes of research are likely to impact different stakeholders. We apply these approaches to eastern Germany, where the increase in several wildlife populations (i.e., wild boar, common crane, gray wolf, and European bison) has contributed to conflict with people. We demonstrate the complementarity of FoPIA, SEEDS, and 3i in identifying stakeholder needs and showing how wildlife dynamics may affect coexistence and create imbalanced ecosystem service and disservice distributions. The integrated framework introduced here provides guidelines for analyzing the multistage process of stakeholder participation and enables a comprehensive approach to the complex challenge of HWCs.

AB  - Fire and grazing in forest ecosystems modify the characteristics of plant communities, favoring colonization by sprouting shrub species. These shrubs may offer protection and facilitate greater survival in slow-growing spe-cies, which are less tolerant of biotic and abiotic stressors. The objective of this study was to evaluate Nothofagus antarctica seedling performance (survival, morphology, water potential, and biomass) under the influence of Berberis microphylla shrubs in sites with different grazing use intensities in burned forests in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. For that, four treatment were established: N. antarctica seedlings planted a) with fence-under shrub b) with fence-outside shrub c) without fence-under shrub d) without fence-outside shrub. Edaphoclimatic condi-tions were measured inside and outside the shrub at the beginning of the experiment and seedling's performance was measured each summer from 2018 to 2020. Results showed that B. microphylla created favorable edapho-climatic condition under its canopy. There was lower soil bulk density, cover of bare soil, PAR, soil and air temperatures, but also higher relative humidity, pH, and vegetation cover. N. antarctica seedlings growing under B. microphylla shrubs had less leaf number, but the survival and the other morphological variables were similar to those growing with fenced outside the shrub. Therefore, B. microphylla shrubs provide physical protection against livestock and generate a favorable microenvironment for N. antarctica seedlings in sites with a high grazing use intensity that negatively affect N. antarctica seedlings. To restore burned or degraded landscapes, our study results suggest that fencing N. antarctica seedlings or planting them under the cover of shrubs to protect N. antarctica seedlings from biotic (herbivore) and abiotic (edaphoclimatic) stress.

AB  - Fences serve multiple purposes, including livestock management, agriculture, property delineation, and conservation. However, fences often act as ecological barriers, limiting wildlife movement and access to resources, particularly for species like bison (Bison bison) in North America. Despite the substantial impacts of fencing, large-scale datasets on fence densities are lacking. Our goal was to create potential fence density maps for the western and central U.S. and Canada using GIS modelling and freely accessible data. Specifically, we aimed to: (1) map potential fence density and identify high density of fence, (2) contrast the potential fence density map with the patterns of high human influences, and (3) identify areas with high bison habitat suitability and low density of potential fences. Using GIS modelling, we generated potential fence density maps by integrating data on land parcels, croplands, roads, and railroads. Subsequently, we identified regions with high and low potential fence density and compared them with patterns of human influence and bison habitat suitability. We found high total potential fence density in central regions of Canada and the U.S., mainly due to agriculture and transportation corridors. Interestingly, areas with high potential density of fence in the western U.S., often had low other human influence, suggesting that human influence maps may underestimate impacts if they miss fences. We also identified large areas with high bison habitat suitability and low fence density, which are promising for bison restoration. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing fences for wildlife conservation and supporting bison restoration in the Great Plains.

AB  - A study was made of the features of the soil cover of solonetz complexes in different parts of the pasture of an average sheep farm in the dry steppe zone in the Manych river basin in the conditions of dissected relief. It has been established that several types of soil cover can be distinguished on the territory of the pasture that differ in the degree of transformation of the profile of different components of the solonetz complex under the influence of intensive grazing. It is shown that the heterogeneity of the soil cover is due to the uneven impact of grazing, which, in turn, is determined both by the degree of remoteness from the farm and by the characteristics of the vegetation cover in different parts of the pasture. The areas with a well-pronounced complexity of the soil cover and a high proportion of solonetzes, dominated by grass-wormwood associations, are subject to the greatest pasture load. A tendency to a reduction in the thickness of the AJ and SEL horizons of light chestnut soils and solonetzes was noted as the pasture load increased. In the soil cover of feather grass areas of pastures, the share of solonetzes is much lower, which can be associated with a short-term pasture load on these soils.

AB  - Resource selection informs understanding of a species' ecology and is especially pertinent for invasive species. Since introduced to Canada, wild pigs (Sus scrofa Linnaeus, 1978) remain understudied despite recognized negative impacts on native and agricultural systems globally. Elsewhere in North America, pigs typically use forests and forage in agricultural crops. We hypothesized Canadian wild pigs would behave similarly, and using GPS locations from 15 individuals, we examined diel and seasonal resource selection and movement in the Canadian prairie region. Forests were predominately selected during the day, while corn (Zea mays L.), oilseeds, and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were predominately selected at night. Forests and corn were consistently selected throughout the growing season. Wetlands and forests showed greater use rates than other habitats, with evident trade-offs as crop use increased with the timing of maturation. Activity was consistent with foraging in growing crops. Results indicate diel patterns were likely a function of short-term needs to avoid daytime anthropogenic risk, while seasonal patterns demonstrate how habitats that fill multiple functional roles-food, cover, and thermoregulation-can be optimized. Understanding selection by invasive species is an important step in understanding their potential environmental impacts in novel environments and informs their management.

AB  - Forest ecosystems are complex systems where it is often hard to predict and explain mutual activities and interactions of individual factors. Different species of big game make an inseparable part of these ecosystems. Game, particularly big ruminants and wild boar are in a constant interaction with the flora of the area they inhabit. Their positive and negative effects vary during different forest stand phenophases and depend on the forest stand age, presence and number of different game species, availability of food, etc. The negative effects of big game on forest stands have been studied worldwide and in Croatia as well. The focus of this research was to analyse the bark damage induced by red deer on young trees of narrow-leaved ash. The research was conducted in two narrow-leaved ash forest stands situated in the Sava river basin in Croatia, where red deer is known to be present. The obtained results indicate that debarking (bark peeling) of young trees starts immediately upon the removal of the protective fence which is usually put up around forest stands during the regeneration period. Diameter at the breast height (DBH) of damaged narrow-leaved ash trees varied from 2 to 18 cm. In trees of greater diameter, new bark peeling didn't occur, and damage induced in previous years became less conspicuous due to the formation of thicker bark layer. Bark damage was visible from the root collar (ground level) up to 190 cm of the stem height. With the increase of DBH (in the range from 2 to 18 cm), the girdling intensity, i.e., the cumulative damage from previous years increased as well. In some research plots the damage was visible on all narrow-leaved ash trees. Bark damage induced by red deer was not observed on the pedunculate oak and indigo bush, which were the two most common woody species in the researched area just after narrow-leaved ash. Conducted bark analysis didn't indicate that the lack of nutrients, soluble sugar or minerals is the reason for the extensive bark peeling of the narrow-leaved ash bark.

AB  - Evaluating plant functional traits helps to understand how plants respond to changing environmental conditions and resource availability associated with disturbance events. Livestock production is one of the primary drivers of tropical forest loss and degradation. Livestock alter environmental conditions within the forest by grazing, trampling and nutrient inputs, which in turn can influence species composition and functional traits of species. Understanding how livestock influence functional traits along a successional gradient is poorly understood. Here, we studied the effect of cattle grazing and fallow age on plant functional traits and soil nutrients in secondary and old-growth tropical dry forests. We analyzed plant functional traits of the most important species in successional and old-growth forest communities in both cattle present and cattle excluded plots. Our results showed the effects of cattle grazing and fallow age on plant functional traits, with fallow age explaining more variation than cattle grazing. In early succession, functional traits were associated with water conservation (thicker leaves, lower specific leaf area), and in later successional they were linked with sunlight conservation (larger height, higher specific leaf area). The presence of large fruits and seeds in advanced successional sites suggests high resource availability, which may help plants to successfully reproduce. Moreover, under cattle grazing some functional traits are associated with herbivory defense (high foliar dry weight and thick leaves). Even though N and C increased as succession advanced, the sites with cattle grazing had higher NH4 and NO3 concentrations as a result of fecal deposition. Plant functional traits responded to fallow age than to cattle grazing. Our study showed that cattle exclusion, as a management and biodiversity conservation strategy, contributes positively to soil nutrition. Thus, fallow age and cattle exclusion facilitate soil recovery and allows establishing species with suitable functional attributes for overcoming environmental filters in abandoned cattle fields.

AB  - Grassland plant diversity has been observed with divergent responses in grazing experiments around the world. However, the dominant role of nitrogen (N) availability in controlling this global variation has not been well explored, impeding our capacity to formulate effective strategies for preserving grassland plant diversity. Here, we synthesized data from 306 grazing experiments that measured plant diversity and soil N content across global grasslands. Overall, grazing reduced plant diversity by 7.63%, with substantial variations observed across the dataset. Our study revealed that these contrasting effects were best explained by soil N change. Plant diversity under enhanced soil N showed a strong increase in response to grazing. We found that lower grazing intensity and higher background N deposition could collectively enhance soil N, thereby promoting diversity. These results suggest that while avoiding high grazing intensity is crucial in maintaining biodiversity of grazed grasslands, it alone is not sufficient. In regions with lower N deposition (< 500 mg N m-2 yr-1), additional management strategies that target improving soil fertility are needed. Our analysis propounds that local environmental conditions should be incorporated into decision-making of grassland biodiversity conservation, or ignoring this may lead to counterproductive impacts.

AB  - Intercropping is an agricultural practice applied worldwide to promote biodiversity and biological control services in an agroecosystem. Here, we assessed the differences in arthropod communities in the canopy between pecan (Carya illinoinensis) orchards intercropped with two flowering crops, rapeseed (Brassica rapa) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus), and monoculture pecan orchards. Our results showed that introducing rapeseed and sunflower changed the community composition of arthropods in the canopy. Compared with the monocropping system, the abundance of total arthropods and arthropod herbivores in the intercropping system was reduced, while the abundance of arthropod natural enemies and neutral arthropods significantly increased. The richness and Shannon diversity index of total arthropods and arthropod natural enemies, as well as the Shannon diversity index of arthropod herbivores, were dramatically higher in the intercropping system. However, the effect of the cropping system on the Shannon diversity index of neutral arthropods showed annual variation. Furthermore, compared to the monocropping system, the intercropping system displayed a more complex co-occurrence network structure and stronger co-occurrence patterns among arthropod natural enemies, arthropod herbivores, and neutral arthropods. Our study indicated that intercropping with rapeseed and sunflower can significantly improve arthropod communities in the canopy in pecan orchards and enhance biological control potential.

AB  - Trace elements are the essential mineral nutrients in grassland, however, we still know little about the distributions of trace elements in grassland with long-term grazing exclusion. The contents, stocks, and proportions of iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), manganese (Mn), and boron (B) in green plant-litter-root-soil were evaluated by enclosing for 18, and 39 years inside the fence (F18 and F39) and grazing outside the fence (F0) in Inner Mongolia grassland. The results showed that F18 and F39 decreased the stocks of Fe, Al, and Mn in green plant and root compared to F0 (p < .05), while increased the stocks of them in litter (p < .05). The stock of Fe, Al, and Mn in green plant at F39 was 28.6%, 13.9%, and 39.2% higher than that at F18. The stocks of four trace elements in first layer litter at F39 were increased by 12.7%-52.2% compared to F18, whereas the stocks of them in third layer litter were decreased by 32.2%-42.5%. The F18 obviously increased the stocks of Fe and Mn in soil, especially B (p < .05). While the stocks of these trace elements in soil at F39 were 9.1%-28.0% lower than that at F18, especially B (p < .05). In conclusion, the trace elements were mainly shifted from green plant and root to soil and third layer litter with 18-year grazing exclusion. Compared to 18-year grazing exclusion, the trace elements were shifted from third layer litter and soil to root with 39-year grazing exclusion.

AB  - We examined natural regeneration changes in an urban natural area forest, the Good Woods, Cobbs Creek Park, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, after placement of exclusion fencing to prevent white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) browsing and unplanned North American beaver (Castor canadensis) felling. Seedlings (stem dbh < 2.5 cm, stump at 15 cm < 3.0 cm), saplings (stem dbh > 2.5-10 cm, stump at 15 cm > 3.0-11 cm), and trees (stem dbh > 10 cm, stump at 15 cm > 11 cm) were surveyed in 65 permanent 10 m X 10 m plots: 6 y after fencing placement to exclude white-tailed deer and 5 mo after the start of beaver felling. Overall seedling abundance increased by 5% while sapling populations grew by 20% and the number of trees expanded by 34% after white-tailed deer exclusion. Red maple (Ater rubrum) seedlings, tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) seedlings, and red oak (Quercus rubra) saplings increased significantly while pignut hickory (Carya glabra) and white ash (Fraxinus americana) seedlings decreased significantly. Seedling and tree losses to North American beaver felling were small (<2% for all seedlings and <3% for all trees). However, beaver felling caused a greater than 60% loss of saplings for red maple, black cherry (Prunus serotina), white oak (Quercus alba), and red oak. Less than 30% of the saplings were lost for pignut hickory, white ash, and tulip poplar. Urban North American beaver preferences for native species saplings paralleled rural beaver in the eastern United States. Our results indicate white-tailed deer exclusion fencing is an effective management method for increasing natural regeneration of both seedlings and saplings in an urban natural area forest when the fencing also effectively excludes North American beaver.

AB  - The majority of tallgrass prairie has been converted to agriculture over the past two centuries. Restoration projects have sought to increase the quality and size of prairie fragments, with the potential to increase grassland breeding bird habitat. American bison (Bison bison) are being reintroduced to prairie restoration sites and the immediate impacts of these reintroductions are unclear. Our goal was to understand how bison reintroduction influences grassland bird nests and the potential mechanisms behind any change. We measured nest density, nest success, and brood parasitism with a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design to determine if bison influenced pooled nesting success of breeding passerines and field sparrows (Spizella pusilla), the most common nester. In addition, we measured visual obstruction and avian species composition to determine if they changed after the reintroduction. Bison did not influence nest density, brood parasitism, or visual obstruction. Pooled nest success was higher during the first 2 y in bison sites after the reintroduction but decreased the following 2 y. Bird species composition differed slightly between areas with and without bison, but this was not due to the reintroduction and was likely due to other site characteristics. Field sparrow nest success was higher before and after reintroduction in bison sites and drove the pooled nest success results in bison sites. Caution should be taken when interpreting pooled nest data, but these results suggest that bison did not negatively impact nest success of grassland nesting birds immediately following their reintroduction (<5 y).

AB  - In Australia, livestock predation by dingoes (Canis familiaris) has contributed to what some livestock producers consider a dire situation for rangeland pastoralism, driving demand for cooperative regional-scale exclusion ('cell') fencing (i.e. pest-proof fences that encompass one or more individual properties) and landscape-scale predator control. The present case study predicted the effect of four cell-fences in the state of Western Australia (WA) on the gross margin of sheep (for meat or meat and wool) and cattle pastoral enterprises. We modelled the potential effects of the following four key variables: (1) four levels of commodity prices, (2) five levels of livestock weaning rate (based on livestock records collected 1985-1995; weaning rate is defined as number of lambs or calves that are born and survive to weaning, expressed as percentage of total mated females), (3) three predicted levels of time required to remove dingoes from within the fenced area, and (4) five levels of macropod (mainly kangaroo) response as competitive grazers, with a total of 3600 scenarios representing all combinations of these factors. Each scenario was assessed for profitability (i.e. net present value (NPV) over 25 years) and benefit of fencing (i.e. NPV compared with an unfenced enterprise of the same livestock type, region, and commodity prices). Finally, the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of investment in cell fencing was calculated for each fenced scenario. The majority (67%) of scenarios representing continuation of current management (i.e. no cell fencing) returned a negative NPV (i.e. livestock enterprises were projected to make a loss). However, only 37.4% of cell-fenced scenarios returned a positive NPV, meaning that even with a cell-fence and successful removal of dingoes, the enterprise was still unlikely to be profitable. Only 43.4% of cell-fenced scenarios returned a BCR of cell fencing greater than one. Weaning rate following dingo removal was the most important factor determining return on investment for cell-fencing. Survival and reproduction of small livestock, particularly wool sheep, benefit most from cell-fencing, whereas cell-fencing and dingo removal did not result in greater profits for cattle enterprises. Running sheep for wool and meat within cell fencing coupled with removal of dingoes would maximise the likelihood of achieving a positive return on investment in cell fencing (although the enterprise may remain unprofitable overall); otherwise, unfenced enterprises affected by dingoes should run cattle as this will be more profitable.

AB  - Rare or endangered species largely contributing to global biodiversity are essential components of ecosystems. Because genetic diversity depends not only on apparent population size but also demographic processes, the conservation priority of endangered species based on population genetics needs to be assessed by comparison with common congeners and demographic events. In this study, we performed population genetic analysis for Gentiana yakushimensis Makino, a rare and endangered plant species with an isolated distribution on Yakushima Island, Japan. We performed comparison of genetic diversity with the congener (Gentiana triflora Pall. var. japonica [Kusn.] H.Hara), demographic inference, and bottleneck test based on genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms. The result was that G. yakushimensis had an extremely low genetic diversity level and a high inbreeding coefficient level compared with those of the congener. The population of G. yakushimensis was estimated to experience an expansion during the Last Glacial Maximum and a recent bottleneck by the demographic inference and the bottleneck test. Therefore, the low level of genetic diversity of this species might have resulted from the impact of the recent bottleneck and the long-term maintenance of a small population size. Due to the long lifespan of the genus Gentiana, the current level of genetic diversity probably does not reflect a large part of recent demographic events, which requires long-term monitoring of changes in genetic diversity to identify the time lag between the reduction in apparent population size and genetic diversity as a future outlook.

AB  - This study aims to describe the distribution of ocean sunfishes (family Molidae) in the greater Dyer Island ecosystem off the southwest coast of South Africa. Between 2014 and 2022, local whale watching vessels operating under Dyer Island Cruises conducted 3 227 trips which resulted in 274 trips with Molidae sightings, with a total of 300 individuals sighted. Molidae sightings showed a significant correlation to sea surface temperature and a strong seasonal pattern. Sightings in the greater Dyer Island area increased significantly after 2016, suggesting a correlation with the decline of white shark Carcharodon carcharias sightings, with further increases in 2021. This suggests that the greater Dyer Island ecosystem has become a more favoured habitat for species of Molidae.

AB  - The settlement of Iceland is known to have had profound impacts on vegetation and landscape stability, but there remain uncertainties around the spatial variability and timing of environmental change, and the impacts of settlement on aquatic ecosystems. Here a new multiproxy palaeoenvironmental reconstruction spanning the last 3000 years is presented from Kalmanstjorn, a small lake in Myvatnssveit, northeast Iceland. Sedimentology, pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs, and geochemical proxies, dated using tephrochronology, are used to reconstruct terrestrial vegetation, landscape stability and aquatic ecosystems. The data reveal complex environmental dynamics after settlement. At this site, substantial tree populations persisted until the late 15th century, in strong contrast to the rapid deforestation shown by almost all other records from Iceland. The eventual loss of woodland may have been caused by changes in direct human activity and the location of extensive grazing, in combination with Little Ice Age climatic cooling. The loss of woodland was accompanied by increased soil erosion. Conversely, the lake ecosystem showed an immediate response to settlement, becoming more productive for several centuries, perhaps in response to increased availability of nutrients from grazing herbivores. The late persistence of woodland in the Kalmanstjorn record adds to our understanding of the spatial variations in ecosystem responses to settlement in Iceland, while the evidence for decoupling of the aquatic and terrestrial systems suggests that palaeolimnological reconstructions focusing on aquatic ecosystem responses may be important new sources of information on the wider ecological consequences of human settlement.

AB  - Mammal studies in the South of the Yucatan Peninsula often focus on local diversity, abundance, or subsistence hunting impacts. Our study uniquely examines the effects of water availability and human disturbance on medium- and large-sized terrestrial mammal diversity. Using 109 camera traps across two areas, Silvituc and Centenario, with differing human influence and water availability, we recorded 4,105 independent events representing 23 species. Silvituc, with higher water availability and lower hunting pressure, exhibited slightly greater species diversity (D1) than Centenario. Rank-abundance curves and NDMS analysis highlighted differences in mammal community structure between the two areas. Our findings suggest that water availability and hunting pressure may influence the presence of certain species, with potential impacts on habitat-dependent mammals. These results underscore the need for tailored management strategies in the Natural Protected Area, particularly to address anthropogenic effects in the Centenario area.

AB  - European grasslands and their biodiversity are declining rapidly due to land use changes, which highlight the need to develop effective restoration strategies. This study investigates the impact of reintroducing the Swedish national horse breed (the Gotland Russ) on grassland plant diversity and evenness in abandoned agricultural landscapes in Southeast Sweden. Twelve horses were introduced into three 10-13-hectare enclosure replicates (four horses per enclosure) in a three-year (2014-2016) rewilding experiment. Plant species richness, evenness, and diversity were investigated in both grazed and un-grazed conditions. The results indicate that horse grazing significantly increased grassland plant species diversity and richness, with higher Shannon and Simpson's diversity indices in grazed areas. In addition, the abundance of white clover (Trifolium repens), a signal species beneficial to pollinators, increased significantly in grazed areas. These findings emphasize the need for integrating large herbivore grazing into ecological restoration practices. Considering the recently enacted EU Nature Restoration Law, which aims to restore 20% of Europe's degraded ecosystems by 2030, this research provides critical insights into scalable restoration methods. The implementation of restoration strategies that include large herbivores may enhance the resilience and biodiversity of European grasslands, thereby aligning with the EU's restoration goals.

AB  - The summer season of 2019-2020 has been named Australia's Black Summer because of the large forest fires that burnt for months in southeast Australia, affecting millions of Australia's citizens and hundreds of millions of animals and capturing global media attention. This extensive fire season has been attributed to the global climate crisis, a long drought season and extreme fire weather conditions. Our aim in this study was to examine the factors that have led some of the wildfires to burn over larger areas for a longer duration and to cause more damage to vegetation. To this end, we studied all large forest and non-forest fires (>100 km(2)) that burnt in Australia between September 2019 and mid-February 2020 (Australia's Black Summer fires), focusing on the forest fires in southeast Australia. We used a segmentation algorithm to define individual polygons of large fires based on the burn date from NASA's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fires product and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burnt area product (MCD64A1). For each of the wildfires, we calculated the following 10 response variables, which served as proxies for the fires' extent in space and time, spread and intensity: fire area, fire duration (days), the average spread of fire (area/days), fire radiative power (FRP; as detected by NASA's MODIS Collection 6 active fires product (MCD14ML)), two burn severity products, and changes in vegetation as a result of the fire (as calculated using the vegetation health index (VHI) derived from AVHRR and VIIRS as well as live fuel moisture content (LFMC), photosynthetic vegetation (PV) and combined photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation (PV+NPV) derived from MODIS). We also computed more than 30 climatic, vegetation and anthropogenic variables based on remotely sensed derived variables, climatic time series and land cover datasets, which served as the explanatory variables. Altogether, 391 large fires were identified for Australia's Black Summer. These included 205 forest fires with an average area of 584 km(2) and 186 non-forest fires with an average area of 445 km(2); 63 of the forest fires took place in southeast (SE) Australia (the area between Fraser Island, Queensland, and Kangaroo Island, South Australia), with an average area of 1097 km(2). Australia's Black Summer forest fires burnt for more days compared with non-forest fires. Overall, the stepwise regression models were most successful at explaining the response variables for the forest fires in SE Australia (n = 63; median-adjusted R-2 of 64.3%), followed by all forest fires (n = 205; median-adjusted R-2 of 55.8%) and all non-forest fires (n = 186; median-adjusted R-2 of 48.2%). The two response variables that were best explained by the explanatory variables used as proxies for fires' extent, spread and intensity across all models for the Black Summer forest and non-forest fires were the change in PV due to fire (median-adjusted R-2 of 69.1%) and the change in VHI due to fire (median-adjusted R-2 of 66.3%). Amongst the variables we examined, vegetation and fuel-related variables (such as previous frequency of fires and the conditions of the vegetation before the fire) were found to be more prevalent in the multivariate models for explaining the response variables in comparison with climatic and anthropogenic variables.
   This result suggests that better management of wildland-urban interfaces and natural vegetation using cultural and prescribed burning as well as planning landscapes with less flammable and more fire-tolerant ground cover plants may reduce fire risk to communities living near forests, but this is challenging given the sheer size and diversity of ecosystems in Australia.

AB  - A photographic seabed survey conducted off the Antarctic Peninsula region provided the opportunity to study spatial patterns, abundance and behaviour of the notothenioid benthic fish fauna. Overall, a total of 12,715 images taken with the Ocean Floor Observation System (OFOS) along 26 transects in three ecoregions (Joinville Island, Bransfield Strait and Drake Passage) were analysed. The fish fauna consisted of at least 34 species belonging to four families of both low-Antarctic and high-Antarctic origin. Nototheniids showed the highest relative abundance and species richness, followed by channichthyids, bathydraconids and artedidraconids. Direct in-situ observations in OFOS seabed images allowed descriptions of fish behaviour, such as aggregation of individuals (Notothenia coriiceps), specific body postures (Cygnodraco mawsoni and Cryodraco antarcticus) and parental care (Chaenodraco wilsoni, Chionodraco rastrospinosus, Pagetopsis macropterus and Trematomus hansoni). Fish density and species richness was primarily correlated with the occurrence of bryozoans, ascidians, and large cup-shaped sponges, providing a three-dimensional habitat suitable for fish settling, foraging, breeding and refuge from predators. Fish diversity was higher (a) off Joinville Island and in Bransfield Strait than in Drake Passage, where almost exclusively low-Antarctic species were recorded, and (b) between 100 and 600 m than at greater depths. Overall, the benthic fish fauna off the northern Antarctic Peninsula is zoogeographically composite and widespread, with well-structured spatial partitioning.

AB  - AimGlobal-scale studies are necessary to draw general conclusions on how trophic interactions vary with urbanization and to explore how the effects of urbanization change along latitudinal gradients. We predict that the intensity of trophic interactions decreases in response to urbanization (quantified by human population density). Since trophic interactions are more intense at lower latitudes, we also expect major impacts of urbanization at higher latitudes, where base levels are essentially lower.LocationGlobal (881 study sites).Time period2000-2021.Major taxa studiedBirds, arthropods and woody plants.MethodsWe compiled global data on insect herbivory and bird predation from studies that employed similar methods and fitted generalized linear mixed models to test how these trophic interactions vary with human population density, latitude and their interactions.ResultsThe intensity of herbivory and predation decreased with an increase in human population density at lower latitudes. Surprisingly, it remained unaffected at intermediate latitudes and even increased at higher latitudes.Main conclusionsThe observed patterns may be attributed to local climate changes in urban areas, such as the Urban Heat Island effect, which disrupts thermal stability in the tropics while increasing niche availability at polar latitudes.

AB  - The axis deer (Axis axis) is a species of ungulate native to the Indian subcontinent. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the axis deer was introduced to many regions of the world, where it established non-native free-ranging populations. The introduction of the axis deer to Croatia resulted in three populations that still live on the Adriatic islands. In this study, two new mitochondrial DNA control region (D-loop) haplotypes were identified in 39 axis deer samples from two Adriatic islands Rab and Dugi Otok in Croatia. Two distinct D-loop haplotypes found in Croatian axis deer populations indicate that axis deer in Croatia were introduced from at least two maternal lineages. Genetic differentiation between populations was quite low and not significant. Haplotype (0.497) and nucleotide (0.006) diversity of Croatian axis deer was similar to that of axis deer from Queensland, Australia (0.461 and 0.002, respectively). For a better understanding of the origin and genetic diversity of the introduced axis deer from Croatia, analysis of native populations and the addition of highly variable nuclear markers is required.

AB  - Declining arthropod communities have recently gained a lot of attention, with climate and land-use change among the most frequently discussed drivers. Here, we focus on a seemingly underrepresented driver of arthropod community decline: biological invasions. For approximately 12 000 years, earthworms have been absent from wide parts of northern North America, but they have been re-introduced with dramatic consequences. Most studies investigating earthworm-invasion impacts focus on the belowground world, resulting in limited knowledge on aboveground-community changes. We present observational data on earthworm, plant and aboveground arthropod communities in 60 plots, distributed across areas with increasing invasion status (low, medium and high) in a Canadian forest. We analysed how earthworm-invasion status and biomass impact aboveground arthropod community abundance, biomass and species richness, and how earthworm impacts cascade across trophic levels. We sampled approximately 13 000 arthropods, dominated by Hemiptera, Diptera, Araneae, Thysanoptera and Hymenoptera. Total arthropod abundance, biomass and species richness declined significantly from areas of low to those with high invasion status, with reductions of 61, 27 and 18%, respectively. Structural equation models suggest that earthworms directly and indirectly impact arthropods across trophic levels. We show that earthworm invasion can alter aboveground multi-trophic arthropod communities and suggest that belowground invasions might be underappreciated drivers of aboveground arthropod decline.

AB  - BackgroundWinters are expected to warm more than summers in central and northern Europe, with largely unknown effects on grassland plant communities.AimsBy studying the interactions between winter warming and summer grazing, we aimed to disentangle their effects and give recommendations for future grassland management.MethodsOur study area Upper Teesdale, England has winter temperatures close to 0 degrees C and a well-studied vegetation, known for its arctic-alpine species growing at their climatic warm range limits. We set up a winter warming experiment using open top chambers (ca. +0.5 degrees C) from mid-September until mid-May 2019 to 2022 and excluded sheep grazing during summer in a fully factorial design.ResultsGraminoid biomass increased, and bryophyte biomass decreased with winter warming. There was little to no evidence that winter warming affected any of the other plant response variables we measured, neither did grazing nor the interaction between winter warming and grazing.ConclusionsOur experiment was relatively short in duration and treatments were realistic in magnitude, therefore the plant communities responded only slightly. Nevertheless, our data suggest a change towards more dominant vascular species and less bryophytes with winter warming, which might lead to lasting changes in the plant communities in the longer-term if not buffered by suitable grazing management.

AB  - Aim: Introduced mammal herbivores are predicted to negatively affect insular flora. However, disentangling which particular traits (1) developed from exaptations and (2) are functional to avoid herbivory remains mainly unknown. This study aims to assess if the flora of continental islands with historic native herbivores are exapted to the introduction of new mammal herbivores and to predict the potential vulnerability of endemic species from islands where mammal herbivores have not been introduced.Location: Balearic Islands.Taxon: 96 Balearic endemic plant species.Methods: We investigated whether the endemic flora on continental islands maintains functional traits that resist introduced mammal herbivores by analysing the chemical and morphological traits related to plant resistance of five individuals for each of 98 species. Also, we measured plant-size variables to assess plant escape strategies. Overall, we combined these traits with the accessibility to goats. Predictive models were generated for species that inhabit islands where goats have not been introduced to assess their potential vulnerability.Results: Endemic species may defend against new herbivores (e.g. goats) if they contain highly toxic compounds (alkaloids, glycosides, coumarins), spinescent and urticating structures, or specific plant architecture (low plant size, high specific leaf area). If such traits are absent, the species may become extinct-unless they inhabit areas inaccessible to goats. On continental islands, some endemic species are expected to resist the introduction of herbivores, while others may be significantly affected.Main Conclusions: From the ancient connection with the mainland, exaptations may allow the plants to resist the presence of introduced herbivores. However, non-exapted species could be threatened by the introduction of non-native ungulates.

AB  - Cabo Verde is a well-known marine megafauna biodiversity hotspot in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean. As a Small Island Developing State, fishing is one of its most important economic activities and a major source of animal protein. Yet, the interaction and impacts of the artisanal fisheries on shark species are poorly known in this region. To fill this gap, between April and June 2024, we conducted 152 face-to-face interviews with fishers from the 10 main fishing communities on Santiago Island, Cabo Verde. Most respondents (95%) reported the presence of sharks in their fishing grounds all year round (59%) and at certain times of the year (41%). Eighty-five percent indicated that they catch sharks, but the majority (63%) said they do so unintentionally. The catch is made up of at least 18 species of sharks, almost all of which are threatened with extinction, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Most fishers (80%) had noticed a reduction in the number of sharks over the last 15 years, attributing the cause almost unanimously to fishing (96%) mainly by the international fleet. Around half (51%) believed that it will continue to reduce over the next 15 years. Nevertheless, 33% of the fishers interviewed declared that they do not support shark conservation. Although fishers are valuable sources of information, the present results also show the need to improve fisher's perceptions of sharks and involve them in decision-making processes and management measures to reduce the impacts of artisanal fishing on endangered species.

AB  - Feral goats, Capra hircus (Bovidae), currently occur across 28% of Australia, and are found in all states and territories as well as some offshore islands. Feral goats are harvested for live export or processed as game meat, with feral goats making up approximately 90% of goats sent to slaughter in Australia. Nymphs of the pentastomid parasite, Linguatula serrata, are common parasites of goats elsewhere in the world, where they cause Halzoun or Marrara disease in humans through the consumption of nymphs in raw or semi-cooked edible offal. Despite being commonly encountered in cattle at slaughter in Australia, L. serrata nymphs have never been reported from feral goats in Australia. Goats at slaughter, however, commonly show infections of lymph nodes, the majority of which are diagnosed as caseous lymphadenitis caused by bacteria, although a small number have no known aetiology. Examination of 33 feral goats from locations in New South Wales and South Australia found a Linguatula sp. nymph encased in the mesenteric lymph node of one goat from the Cooma region of New South Wales. The potential risk of transmission of Linguatula sp. to humans and other domestic animals is discussed. This study has highlighted the importance of continued surveys of feral animals for infection with parasites, especially as their distribution changes.

AB  - Depredation of domestic horses (Equus caballus) by jaguars (Panthera onca) is an example of human-wildlife conflict that has not received much attention. We monitored spatio-temporal activity and distribution of horses in a 2.64-km(2) fenced area in the dry forest of northwestern Costa Rica in response to 16 jaguar killings of horses during January-November 2017. We monitored 4 horses (2 males, 2 females) equipped with global positioning system transmitters from February-September 2018 to identify daily and seasonal patterns of use of cover types and a water source by horses. We then compared these results to the previous locations where jaguars killed horses to identify the circumstances under which horses seemed more vulnerable to jaguar predation. Based on 1,693 locations, horses spent most time in grassland (92%) rather than forest and edge vegetation (8%) and used a core area of 0.74 km(2) (kernel density estimation) to 0.86 km(2) (minimum convex polygon). Of 16 horse predation events by jaguars, 9 events (56%) occurred in grasslands, 4 in forested areas (25%), and 3 in the forest edge (19%), indicating predation events occurred disproportionately from expected counts based on horse use of vegetation. The predation sites were characterized by a higher proportion of edge and a lower proportion of forest compared to a random points. We suggest that when horses explored areas near the edge of forested areas, the chances of being preyed on by jaguars increased.

AB  - Nutrient enrichment is widespread throughout grassland systems and expected to increase during the Anthropocene. Trophic interactions, like aboveground herbivory, have been shown to mitigate its effect on plant diversity. Belowground herbivory may also impact these habitats' response to nutrient enrichment, but its influence is much less understood, and likely to depend on factors such as the herbivores' preference for dominant species and the symmetry of belowground competition. If preferential toward the dominant, fastest growing species, root herbivores may reduce these species' relative fitness and support diversity during nutrient enrichment. However, as plant competition belowground is commonly considered to be symmetric, root herbivores may be less impactful than shoot herbivores because they do not reduce any competitive asymmetry between the dominant and subordinate plants. To better understand this system, we used an established, two-layer, grassland community model to run a full-factorially designed simulation experiment, crossing the complete removal of aboveground herbivores and belowground herbivores with nutrient enrichment. After 100 yr of simulation, we analyzed communities' diversity, competition on the individual level, as well as their resistance and recovery. The model reproduced both observed general effects of nutrient enrichment in grasslands and the short-term trends of specific experiments. We found that belowground herbivores exacerbate the negative influence of nutrient enrichment on Shannon diversity within our model grasslands, while aboveground herbivores mitigate its effect. Indeed, data on individuals' above- and belowground resource uptake reveals that root herbivory reduces resource limitation belowground. As with nutrient enrichment, this shifts competition aboveground. Since shoot competition is asymmetric, with larger, taller individuals gathering disproportionate resources compared to their smaller, shorter counterparts, this shift promotes the exclusion of the smallest species. While increasing the root herbivores' preferences toward dominant species lessens their negative impact, at best they are only mildly advantageous, and they do very little reduce the negative consequences of nutrient enrichment. Because our model's belowground competition is symmetric, we hypothesize that root herbivores may be beneficial when root competition is asymmetric. Future research into belowground herbivory should account for the nature of competition belowground to better understand the herbivores' true influence.

AB  - We used a network of motion-sensitive cameras and weekly transect surveys during a replicated cattle grazing experiment to assess the influence of dormant season grazing, spring-summer rotational grazing, and grazing exclusion on the activity of rodent, meso-mammalian, lagomorph and reptilian species in southeast Oregon, USA, from 2018-2021. Activity of chipmunks ( Neotamias spp.) and mice (subfamily Neotominae ), was lower in moderate intensity rotationally grazed pastures compared to nongrazed pastures. When considering differences with respect to rotation (spring or summer) or cattle presence, we found evidence for reduced activity of most rodents (including chipmunks, ground squirrels [ Urocitellus spp.], kangaroo rats [family Heteromyidae ], and mice), with the largest reductions during summer grazing. We did not observe a direct effect of grazing on meso-predators, including American badgers ( Taxidea taxus ), and coyotes ( Canis latrans ). Perennial forb cover was associated with increased ground squirrel activity and coyote and badger occupancy, suggesting indirect effects stemming from vegetation food resources. Our results suggest grazing influences the activity and occupancy of many species within the sagebrush ecosystem food web, which has implications for several species of management concern. As the sagebrush ecosystem continues to shrink, managers should consider the influences of grazing management on the dynamics of species interactions, including predator-prey relationships.

AB  - Reintroduction and dispersal of the livestock and wildlife pest, southern cattle fever tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Canestrini), along the U.S.-Mexico border in the southernmost counties of Cameron and Willacy has been attributed mostly to nilgai antelope, Boselaphus tragocamelus (Pallas), and to a lesser extent, white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmerman). Nilgai are competent hosts of R. microplus, have large home ranges, and are distributed from southern Texas into northeastern Mexico where R. microplus, a vector of bovine babesiosis, is endemic. The study documents movement of nilgai and white-tailed deer through gaps in game fencing previously built to redirect movements of the endangered ocelot, Leopardus pardalis (L.), to wildlife crossings. Game fencing limits movement of nilgai and white-tailed deer and thus reduces the spread of cattle fever ticks. Additional game fencing is proposed to limit movement of tick-infested nilgai, white-tailed deer, and further redirect ocelots to crossings to avoid mortality on roads. In other parts of Cameron and Willacy counties where road mortality to ocelots is not an issue, game fencing is designed with large openings to block nilgai but allow free movement for endangered feline species. This research demonstrates how efforts to protect livestock from an exotic pest can also merge with goals of protecting endangered species in the same environment.

AB  - Swine coronaviruses affecting pigs have been studied sporadically in wildlife. In Argentina, epidemiological surveillance of TGEV/PRCV is conducted only in domestic pigs. The aim was to assess the prevalence of TGEV/PRCV in wild Suina. Antibodies against these diseases in wild boar and captive collared peccary were surveyed by ELISA. Antibodies against TGEV were found in three collared peccaries (n = 87). No TGEV/PRCV antibodies were detected in wild boar (n = 160). Preventive measures should be conducted in contact nodes where the transmission of agents may increase. Epidemiological surveillance in wildlife populations and in captive animals before their reintroduction should be attempted.

AB  - Island biogeography is the study of the spatio-temporal distribution of species, communities, assemblages or ecosystems on islands and other isolated habitats. Island diversity is structured by five classes of process: dispersal, establishment, biotic interactions, extinction and evolution. Classical approaches in island biogeography focused on species richness as the deterministic outcome of these processes. This has proved fruitful, but species traits can potentially offer new biological insights into the processes by which island life assembles and why some species perform better at colonising and persisting on islands. Functional traits refer to morphological and phenological characteristics of an organism or species that can be linked to its ecological strategy and that scale up from individual plants to properties of communities and ecosystems. A baseline hypothesis is for traits and ecological strategies of island species to show similar patterns as a matched mainland environment. However, strong dispersal, environmental and biotic-interaction filters as well as stochasticity associated with insularity modify this baseline. Clades that do colonise often embark on distinct ecological and evolutionary pathways, some because of distinctive evolutionary forces on islands, and some because of the opportunities offered by freedom from competitors or herbivores or the absence of mutualists. Functional traits are expected to be shaped by these processes. Here, we review and discuss the potential for integrating functional traits into island biogeography. While we focus on plants, the general considerations and concepts may be extended to other groups of organisms. We evaluate how functional traits on islands relate to core principles of species dispersal, establishment, extinction, reproduction, biotic interactions, evolution and conservation. We formulate existing knowledge as 33 working hypotheses. Some of these are grounded on firm empirical evidence, others provide opportunities for future research. We organise our hypotheses under five overarching sections. Section A focuses on plant functional traits enabling species dispersal to islands. Section B discusses how traits help to predict species establishment, successional trajectories and natural extinctions on islands. Section C reviews how traits indicate species biotic interactions and reproduction strategies and which traits promote intra-island dispersal. Section D discusses how evolution on islands leads to predictable changes in trait values and which traits are most susceptible to change. Section E debates how functional ecology can be used to study multiple drivers of global change on islands and to formulate effective conservation measures. Islands have a justified reputation as research models. They illuminate the forces operating within mainland communities by showing what happens when those forces are released or changed. We believe that the lens of functional ecology can shed more light on these forces than research approaches that do not consider functional differences among species.

AB  - Reef building corals are important in subtropical marine ecoregions, shaping ecosystems and providing habitats for fish and benthic species. Algal communities contribute substantially to the benthic population structure across subtropical coral reefs, however increasing algal cover on subtropical reefs is also linked to degraded ecosystems as has been shown on tropical systems. As such, the dynamics of coral-algal interactions on subtropical reefs are also likely to be an indicator of ecosystem health on subtropical ecosystems. The subtropical lagoonal coral reef of Norfolk Island within the Norfolk Marine Park has been impacted by a regime of disturbance since 2020 including flooding, sedimentation, and heat stress events. Assessing the type and extent of algal interactions with the dominant coral Pocillopora damiconis within the reef sites of Emily Bay, Slaughter Bay, and Cemetery Bay has the potential to provide insight into drivers of ecosystem decline within the reef. Similarly, photochemical efficiency, as measured by yield (Fv/Fm) using pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry, can be used to provide a measure of the health of corals on reefs during degradation events. Here we assess the extent of coral-algal interactions and health of colonies of P. damicornis prior to the onset of summertime conditions (April 2023) and during summertime conditions (December 2023). Seasonal and within site dynamics of coral-algal interactions were evident by a significant bloom of red cyanobacteria (P < 0.0001, April 2023) and Lyngbya {P < 0.01 [Slaughter Bay West (SBW)], P < 0.01 [Slaughter Bay East (SBE)], December 2023}. Within reef, variability of coral-algal interactions was most evident for Lyngbya, and on the Norfolk reef, interactions of Lyngbya with P. damincornis were found to be significantly higher at slaughter bay west (SBW 30.2% of interactions) and east (SBE 24.6% of interactions) in December 2023 than at neighboring Emily (11.6% of interactions) and Cemetery Bay (0.6% of interactions). Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) fluorometry also highlighted the potential for algal interactions to influence the photochemical efficiency of Pocillopora damicornis. Benthic structure, as measured by coral-algal interactions, and coral health within the Norfolk lagoonal, both highlight the potential for anthropogenic drivers of reef decline to influence the health of the ecosystem. Further investigation is therefore necessary to elucidate the specific causes and consequences of algae linked to poor water quality, such as red cyanobacteria and Lyngbya, interacting with corals.

AB  - Background Refaunation/rewilding by large ungulates represents a cost-efficient approach to managing natural biotopes and may be particularly useful for areas whose biodiversity depends on disturbance dynamics and is imperilled by successional changes. To study impacts of refaunation on invertebrates, we focused on butterflies inhabiting the former military training range Milovice, Czech Republic, refaunated since 2015 by a combination of Exmoor pony ("wild" horse), Tauros cattle ("aurochs"), and European wisent. Methods We analysed butterfly presence-absence patterns immediately after the military use termination (early 1990s), prior to the refaunation (2009), and after it (2016-19); and current abundance data gained by monitoring butterflies at refaunated and neglected plots. We used correspondence analysis for the presence-absence comparison and canonical correspondence analysis for the current monitoring, and related results of both ordination methods to the life history and climatic traits, and conservation-related attributes, of recorded butterflies. Results Following the termination of military use, several poorly mobile species inclining towards oceanic climates were lost. Newly gained are mobile species preferring warmer continental conditions. The refaunated plots hosted higher butterfly species richness and abundances. Larger-bodied butterflies developing on coarse grasses and shrubs inclined towards neglected plots, whereas refaunated plots supported smaller species developing on small forbs. Conclusion The changes in species composition following the cessation of military use were attributable to successional change, coupled with changes in species pool operating at larger scales. By blocking succession, large ungulates support butterflies depending on competitively poor plants. Restoring large ungulates populations represents a great hope for conserving specialised insects, provided that settings of the projects, and locally adapted ungulate densities, do not deplete resources for species with often contrasting requirements.

AB  - The tragic decline of plains bison (Bison bison bison) in North America is well known. By the turn of the 20th century, plains bison, once numbering in the tens of millions, were extirpated from the wild in Canada. Banff National Park, AB, Canada, is within the original range of bison in North America, and still contains suitable habitat for the species. In 2017, we used measures of genetic diversity, as well as age and reproductive status, to select 16 plains bison for reintroduction to an unoccupied corner of their former historic range in Banff National Park. However, five of the preferred founders from this genetically diverse group needed to be substituted for less ideal candidates when aggressive behavior was observed, which could have compromised animal welfare during translocation. The level of genetic diversity in the founding population was therefore lower than if all proposed founders had been used, although the difference was not substantial. As expected, adults in this small, reintroduced herd had lower observed heterozygosity and number of alleles than the larger source herd, but expected heterozygosity was higher, likely a result of preferentially choosing individuals with rare alleles. Another substantial contribution to genetic diversity was in unborn fetuses: sired by males that were not translocated, the calves born a few months later provided a boost to the genetic diversity of this small founder herd. Where opportunities allow, the inclusion of pregnant females can significantly increase the genetic diversity of small founder populations. When compared to other founded herds of bison, the techniques described here have ensured that the newly established Banff NP herd is one of the most diverse bison herds in Canada, despite its relatively small number of founders.

AB  - Fucus vesiculosus (here Fucus) is a key species on rocky shores of the Baltic Sea, providing habitat for a diverse invertebrate community. While the invertebrate species within Fucus belts and their general distribution in the Baltic Sea are well known, much less is known about variation in invertebrate abundances and in community composition on different spatial scales. With requirements to monitor the status of marine habitats and com-munities, knowledge on species variation across environmental gradients is increasingly important. Knowledge on the abundances of different grazer species is also needed to evaluate the effects of fauna on Fucus on different spatial scales.In this study, a large-scale field campaign in seven geographically distinct areas along the Baltic Sea coast was conducted to assess variation in Fucus-associated invertebrate communities along eutrophication gradients (areas classified as either good, moderate or poor status). In addition, local scale exposure effects on invertebrate communities were studied. Eutrophication-related variation in invertebrate communities was found, with generally lower species abundances in the good status areas compared to areas in poor or moderate status. Especially in poor status areas, Fucus hosted high abundances of gammarids and chironomids. No specific taxa clearly functioned as an indicator for the eutrophication status and Pielou's evenness was similar across studied areas. However, lower Shannon diversity and number of taxa were found in areas where the status of Fucus is poor. Furthermore, abundances of some taxa, e.g. Idotea spp. isopods and Theodoxus fluviatilis snails were lower in areas where the non-indigenous crab Rhithropanopeus harrisii has been observed. On a local scale, exposed sides of small islands had less T. fluviatilis. This study took the first step to unravel spatial patterns in Fucus- associated invertebrate fauna, and the results illustrate how different environmental and biotic drivers shape these communities both on large and local scales.

AB  - Despite the domestication of sheep and goats by humans for several millennia, we still lack comparative data on their cognitive capacity. Comparing the cognitive skills of farm animals can help understand the evolution of cognition. In this study, we compared the performances of sheep and goats in inference by exclusion tasks. We implemented two tasks, namely a cup task and a tube task, to identify whether success in solving the task could be attributed to either low-level mechanisms (avoiding the empty location strategy) or to deductive reasoning (if two possibilities A and B, but not A, then it must be B). In contrast to a previous study comparing goats and sheep in a cup task, we showed that both species solved the inferential condition with high success rates. In the tube task, performances could not be explained by alternative strategies such as avoiding the empty tube or preferring the bent tube. When applying a strict set of criteria concerning responses in all conditions and controlling for the potential effects of experience, we demonstrate that two individuals, a goat and a sheep, fulfil these criteria. This suggests that sheep and goats are able to make inferences based on deductive reasoning.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) are a leading driver of biodiversity loss worldwide, and have negative impacts on human societies. In most countries, available data on monetary costs of IAS are scarce, while being crucial for developing efficient management. In this study, we use available data collected from the first global assessment of economic costs of IAS (InvaCost) to quantify and describe the economic cost of invasions in Mexico. This description was made across a range of taxonomic, sectoral and temporal variables, and allowed us to identify knowledge gaps within these areas. Overall, costs of invasions in Mexico were estimated at US$ 5.33 billion (i.e., 109) ($MXN 100.84 billion) during the period from 1992 to 2019. Biological invasion costs were split relatively evenly between aquatic (US$ 1.16 billion; $MXN 21.95 billion) and terrestrial (US$ 1.17 billion; $MXN 22.14 billion) invaders, but semi-aquatic taxa dominated (US$ 2.99 billion; $MXN 56.57 billion), with costs from damages to resources four times higher than those from management of IAS (US$ 4.29 billion vs. US$ 1.04 billion; $MXN 81.17 billion vs $MXN 19.68 billion). The agriculture sector incurred the highest costs (US$ 1.01 billion; $MXN 19.1 billion), followed by fisheries (US$ 517.24 million; $MXN 9.79 billion), whilst most other costs simultaneously impacted mixed or unspecified sectors. When defined, costs to Mexican natural protected areas were mostly associated with management actions in terrestrial environments, and were incurred through official authorities via monitoring, control or eradication. On natural protected islands, mainly mammals were managed (i.e. rodents, cats and goats), to a total of US$ 3.99 million, while feral cows, fishes and plants were mostly managed in protected mainland areas, amounting to US$ 1.11 million in total. Pterygoplichthys sp. and Eichhornia crassipes caused the greatest reported costs in unprotected aquatic ecosystems in Mexico, and Bemisia tabaci to terrestrial systems. Although reported damages from invasions appeared to be fluctuating through time in Mexico, management spending has been increasing. These estimates, albeit conservative, underline the monetary pressure that invasions put on the Mexican economy, calling for urgent actions alongside comprehensive cost reporting in national states such as Mexico.

AB  - Insular populations of mammals have been shown to undergo drastic morphological changes relative to mainland counterparts, and these adaptations can provide insight into the evolutionary effects of predation and competition. Selection has been shown to favor more energetically efficient body plans in insular mammals, even when this entails the reduction of anti-predator defenses, but few studies have focused on morphological effects within the same species. Previous research has established that insular large mammals tend to reduce in body size, and that size reduction may not scale isometrically across all body parts. The brain has been a particular subject of interest due to its high energy requirements. Here, we report that an extant, dwarfed island population of black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) exhibits significantly reduced brain mass relative to body mass in comparison to their mainland conspecifics, with brain mass 4.9% smaller in the island population for a given body mass. Further, in the dwarfed population, orbital area was 4.1% smaller for a given body mass, but this reduction was not significant. Foramina magna reduced isometrically. In resource-limited insular environments, negative allometry of the brain is consistent with predictions of reduced investment in energetically costly organs. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to examine the morphological effects of insularity on brain size in two conspecific populations, and these findings suggest that selection toward reduced brain size may act relatively quickly after isolation.

AB  - Caribbean coral reefs are experiencing a shift to algal dominance at the expense of stony corals. Determining the factors leading to algal phase shifts is crucial for assuring the survival of Caribbean coral reefs. In this study, factors controlling the growth of the abundant brown macroalgae Dictyota spp. were investigated by varying herbivory pressure (caging) and nutrients (fertilizer addition) on coral reefs near St. Thomas (US Virgin Islands). Experiment 1 measured Dictyota heights and percent cover at 3 sites (11-20 m depth) and showed no growth response to nutrient addition and a weak negative response to herbivory. To confirm results of Experiment 1, a caging and nutrient manipulation (Experiment 2) was conducted at one site (14 m depth) using the dependent variable Dictyota biomass. A strong negative response of growth to nutrient addition was shown, presumably because of nutrient inhibition, and an equally negative response to herbivory (loss of similar to 50% biomass over 21 d). The inhibitory effect of fertilization on growth was confirmed in a third experiment that showed increasing biomass loss over 4 treatment levels of increasing fertilizer addition (0 [ambient], 5, 10, 20 g). Overall, Dictyota was not nutrient limited at any sites, and was weakly controlled by herbivore populations. Factors responsible for Dictyota abundance on Caribbean reefs may reflect decreased herbivory caused by overfishing and reductions in coral cover and do not appear to be affected by recent changes in nitrogen or phosphorus load. This study reinforces the need for conservation and management of herbivores in coral reef ecosystems, to mitigate the effects from anthropogenic stressors.

AB  - Global savannas are the third largest carbon sink with large human populations being highly dependent on their ecosystem services. However, savannas are changing rapidly due to climate change, fire, animal management, and intense fuelwood harvesting. In southern Africa, large trees (>5 m in height) are under threat while shrub cover (<3 m) is increasing. The collection of multi-date airborne LiDAR (ALS) data, initiated over a decade ago in the Lowveld of South Africa, provided a rare opportunity to quantify the ability of L-band SAR to track changes in savanna vegetation structure and this study is the first to do so, to our knowledge. The objective was to test the ability of ALOS PALSAR 1&2, dual-pol (HH, HV) data to quantify woody cover and volume change in savannas over 2-, 8-and 10-year periods through comparison to ALS. For each epoch (2008, 2010, 2018), multiple PALSAR images were processed to Gamma0 (gamma 0) at 15 m resolution with multi-temporal speckle filtering. ALS data were processed to fractional canopy cover and volume, and then compared to 5 x 5 aggregated (75 m) SAR mean gamma 0. The ALS cover change (Delta CALS) and volume change between pairs of years were highly correlated, with (R2 > 0.8), thus results for cover change applied equally to volume change. Cover change was predicted using (i) direct backscatter change or (ii) the difference between annual cover map product derived using the Bayesian Water Cloud Model (BWCM) and logarithmic models. The linear relationship between Delta gamma 0 and Delta CALS varied between year pairs but reached a maximum R2 of 0.7 for 2018-2010 and a moderate R2 of 0.4 for 2018-2008. Overall, 1 dB Delta gamma 0 corresponded to approximately 0.1 cover change. The three cover change models had very similar uncertainties with mean RMSE = 0.15, which is 13% of the observed cover change range (-0.6 to +0.6). The direct backscatter change approach had less underestimation of positive and negative cover change. The L -band backscatter had a higher sensitivity than suggested by previous studies, as it was able to reliably distinguish cover change at 0.25 increments. The SAR-derived cover change maps detected the loss of stands of big trees, and widespread increases in cover of 0.35-0.65 in communal rangelands due to shrub encroachment. In contrast, the maps suggest that cover generally decreased in conservation areas, forming distinct fence-line effects, potentially caused by significant increases in elephant numbers and frequent, intense wildfires in reserves.

Using a bryophyte-microarthropod microecosystem we tested the combined effects of habitat loss, episodic heat-shocks and an introduced non-native apex predator on ecosystem function (chlorophyll fluorescence as an indicator of photosystem II function) and microarthropod communities (abundance and body size). The photosynthetic function was degraded by the sequence of heat-shock episodes, but unaffected by microecosystem patch size or top-down pressure from the introduced predator. In small microecosystem patches without the non-native predator, Acari abundance decreased with heat-shock frequency, while Collembola abundance increased. These trends disappeared in larger microecosystem patches or when predators were introduced, although Acari abundance was lower in large patches that underwent heat-shocks and were exposed to the predator. Mean assemblage body length (Collembola) was reduced independently in small microecosystem patches and with greater heat-shock frequency. Our experimental simulation of episodic heatwaves, habitat loss and non-native predation pressure in microecosystems produced evidence of individual and potentially synergistic and antagonistic effects on ecosystem function and microarthropod communities. Such complex outcomes of interactions between multiple stressors need to be considered when assessing anthropogenic risks for biota and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Anoa (Bubalus spp.) is a protected endemic species on the Sulawesi Island. An assessment of its habitat is needed to maintain the conservation, especially for the forage plants consume. Therefore, this study aims to determine the types, abundance, and diversity of the available forage plants for Anoa in the Abdul Latief Forest Park. The study was carried out using checkered lines with a descriptive approach in three blocks, including station I as protection block, station II as utilization block, and station III as collection block. The checkered line method contains three repetitions in three blocks with a total area of 1.8 ha. Data analysis was carried out using the Shannon-Wienner variability formula, Margalef wealth index, Evenness abundance, and dominance index. Based on the results, six plants were identified as Anoa feed, including Ficus racemosa L., Elatostema integrifolium (D. Don) Wedd., Nephrolepis sp., Begonia sp., Scleria multifoliata Boeck., and Alpinia sp. Furthermore, the leaf is the most consumed part of the plant by Anoa, and the E. integrifolium (D. Don) Wedd. is the forage plant with the highest abundance value of 49,167 (ind ha-1) in the protection block. Meanwhile, for the diversity value, each block was in a low category at 0.88, 1.28, and 1.44, respectively. Based on the index value of species wealth, the highest value was observed in the collection block; hence more species were discovered in this block than the other two blocks. However, Elatostema integrifolium (D. Don) Wedd. showed a dominance index in the protection block. This study affects the conservation of Anoa in the area to be continued by observing the biodiversity utilization, which is too burdensome without regard to sustainability.

AB  - As communities assemble, species establishment can be driven by multiple factors. Two such factors, nutrients and consumers, are predicted to interact, but few studies have explored whether this interaction results from synergistically altering the same biotic and abiotic mediators or complementarily altering different mediators.To test this, I added seeds of multiple native species to old field communities in which I experimentally manipulated soil nutrients, leaf litter and consumers (insect herbivores and fungal pathogens). Using Bayesian hierarchical modelling, I evaluated the degree to which changes in light and water availability, fungal disease and insect herbivory, and community functional composition influenced seedling establishment and the richness of colonizing species and were driven by experimental treatments. I then examined whether nutrients, litter and consumers interactively determined the success of colonizing species with different resource allocation strategies.Contrary to expectation, nutrient addition and consumer exclusion reduced, and litter removal increased, seedling establishment and colonizer richness independently and via different pathways. Also contrary to expectation, seedling resource allocation strategy did not interact with nutrient addition and consumer exclusion to alter establishment success. Rather, as community damage (foliar fungal disease + insect herbivory) increased, seedlings with high % leaf nitrogen (a proxy for an acquisitive resource allocation strategy) become increasingly disadvantaged relative to seedlings with low % leaf nitrogen (a proxy for a conservative resource allocation strategy).Synthesis: These results indicate that seedling establishment is unlikely to be interactively impacted by nutrients and consumers (fungal pathogens + insect herbivores) because these two drivers act on different environmental pathways to influence community assembly.
   Nutrients and consumers are important drivers of plant community assembly, which are often predicted to act synergistically. In this study, nutrients and consumers acted independently of one another to alter the success of native seedlings. This may have occurred because nutrient addition primarily impacted the availability of other resources, like light and water, while consumer exclusion primarily impacted biotic interactions, like disease and herbivory. Better understanding context-dependence in community assembly will be important for predicting community responses to global change.image

AB  - Grazing by large herbivores can potentially affect interspecific interactions between small herbivores by reducing the ecological fitness of animals. Desert rodents are important components in desert ecosystems and indicators of environmental change. Grazing reduces food resources, but rodents can decrease interspecific niche overlap by adaptive behavior. However, the key factors driving rodent behavioral activities and coexistence in the Alxa desert remains unstudied. We monitored population density and behavioral activities of Midday gerbil (Meriones meridianus) and northern three-toed jerboa (Dipus sagitta) in a grazing exclusion experiment in Alxa desert, Inner Mongolia, China, in 2017. We assessed the relationship between environmental factors (such as plant height, density, coverage, rainfall and temperature) and the behavioral activities of two coexisting rodent species. The results showed that: (1) In summer, grazing significantly reduced the activity time of gerbil and jerboa compared to that in grazing exclusion areas (gerbil: F = 5.98, p < 0.05, eta(2) = 0.22; jerboa: F = 8.57, p < 0.01, eta(2) = 0.28). Grazing reduced the temporal niche overlap with an obvious shifting of activity peaks between two species. (2) Grazing exclusion enhanced the temporal niche overlap between the two rodent species due to greater food availability which relieved inter-specific competition in each season. (3) Grazing strengthened the sensitivity of rodents to environmental changes in all seasons. These results indicated that grazing affected competition between the rodent species by altering vegetation conditions, which in turn affected the temporal niche and activity patterns of rodents.

AB  - The total number of species on earth and the rate at which new species are created are fundamental questions for ecology, evolution and conservation. These questions have typically been approached separately, despite their obvious interconnection. In this study, we approach both questions in conjunction, for all terrestrial animals. To do this, we combine two previously unconnected bodies of theory: general ecosystem models and individual-based ecological neutral theory. General ecosystem models provide us with estimated numbers of individual organisms, separated by functional group and body size. Neutral theory, applied within a guild of functionally similar individuals, connects species richness, speciation rate, and number of individual organisms. In combination, for terrestrial endotherms where species numbers are known, they provide us with estimates for speciation rates as a function of body size and diet class. Extrapolating the same rates to guilds of ectotherms enables us to estimate the species richness of those groups, including species yet to be described. We find that speciation rates per species per million years decrease with increasing body size. Rates are also higher for carnivores compared to omnivores or herbivores of the same body size. Our estimate for the total number of terrestrial species of animals is in the range 1.03-2.92 million species, a value consistent with estimates from previous studies, despite having used a fundamentally new approach. Perhaps what is most remarkable about these results is that they have been obtained using only limited data from larger endotherms and their speciation rates, with the predictive process being based on mechanistic theory. This work illustrates the potential of a new approach to classic eco-evolutionary questions, while also adding weight to existing predictions. As we now face an era of dramatic biological change, new methods will be needed to mechanistically model global biodiversity at the species and individual organism level. This will be a huge challenge but the combination of general ecosystem models and neutral theory that we introduce here is a way to tractably achieve it.

AB  - Restoring free-roaming mammals that fill critical ecological roles requires large connected landscapes that cross jurisdictional boundaries. Plains bison, once nearly extirpated from North America, are now confined to several larger free-roaming herds and a number of small fenced herds in regions where they are often managed as livestock rather than wildlife. Although bison reintroduction efforts are rapidly gaining momentum, restoring free-roaming bison remains challenged by real and perceived wildlife-human conflict. Thus, developing a shared vision for bison recovery, or at least understanding and acknowledging diverse visions, could be critical to success. To address this need, we surveyed experts from government, academia, and conservation organizations to evaluate if there is a shared long-term vision for bison, and to identify the most significant challenges, promising strategies, and research priorities for achieving this vision. We found that most respondents support a future with fenced herds as well as more free-roaming (unfenced) herds, and value bison as wildlife and cultural animals, rather than for livestock. Key challenges to achieving more free-roaming bison included political will, social acceptability, and management across jurisdictional boundaries. Respondents identified successful strategies for overcoming barriers as bottom-up collaborations, economic incentives, and demonstration projects. Research priorities were largely social rather than biophysical, with a strong focus on how to motivate broad public support for free-roaming herds. As an ecological and cultural keystone species, restoring large and connected bison herds where human-bison co-existence is feasible will reap rewards for nature and people.

AB  - Aim: Large herbivore grazing is a popular conservation management tool to promote vegetation structural diversity of rangelands. However, vegetation patch dynamics, that is, how patches of grazing-defended tall vegetation and grazer-preferred short lawns shift over space and time, is poorly understood. Here, we describe a new conceptual framework for patch dynamics within rangelands, combining theories of classical cyclical succession, self-organization and multitrophic feedbacks between grazers, vegetation and bioturbating soil fauna.Location: We use the cattle-grazed salt marsh of the island Schiermonnikoog, The Netherlands, as a model system. The grazed salt marsh is characterized by distinct tall vegetation patches dominated by the grazing-defended rush Juncus maritimus and grazing-intolerant grass Elytrigia atherica, surrounded by a matrix of grazing lawn (dominated by Festuca rubra).The Framework: Based on previous observational and experimental studies, we propose a cyclical patch dynamic where plant species composition and structure transitions through four phases: patch initiation (a) occurs when the grazing-defended rush J. maritimus establishes in the grazed lawn. Patch establishment (b) follows when the grazing-intolerant grass E. atherica establishes in the patch due to associational defence by J. maritimus and produces a large amount of litter that attracts the key bioturbating amphipod Orchestia gammarellus. Patch expansion (c) occurs when O. gammarellus activities improve soil properties of the patch, which favours E. atherica growth, leading to E. atherica competitively displacing J. maritimus in the centre of the patch. Patch degeneration (d) follows when cattle enter the enlarged patch to consume E. atherica in the centre, trample the soil, displace O. gammarellus and decrease vegetation cover, opening space for grazing-lawn species to invade. The cycle restarts when remnants of the rush J. maritimus in the degenerated patches (or individuals recently established from seed dispersal) initiate new patches in the grazing lawn.Synthesis: Our proposed patch-dynamic model provides a means to describe the mechanisms driving vegetation patch dynamics and serves as a foundation for further experimental and observational exploration, not only for this specific system, but more generally for grazed systems worldwide that show patches of typical grazing-defended and grazer-preferred vegetation.

AB  - Carrion is a valuable resource exploited not only by obligate scavengers but also by a wide variety of facultative scavengers. These species provide several important ecosystem services which can suffer if the scavenger community composition is altered, thus reducing the ecosystem provided. We studied the response of the Mediterranean facultative scavenger community to the exclusion of larger scavenger species (red fox Vulpes vulpes, European badger Meles meles, and wild boar Sus scrofa) using an exclusion fence permeable to small scavenger species (mainly Egyptian mongoose Herpestes ichneumon, common genet Genetta genetta, and stone marten Martes foina). The exclusion of dominant facultative scavengers led to a significant reduction in the amount of carrion consumed and an increase in carrion available for smaller species and decomposers, over a longer period of time. Although carrion consumption by the non-excluded species increased inside the exclusion area relative to the control area, it was insufficient to compensate for the carrion not eaten by the dominant scavengers. Of the small scavenger species, only the Egyptian mongoose significantly increased its carrion consumption in the exclusion area, and was the main beneficiary of the exclusion of dominant facultative scavengers. Therefore, altering the facultative scavenger community in Mediterranean woodlands can reduce the efficiency of small carcass removal and benefit other opportunistic species, such as the Egyptian mongoose, by increasing the carrion available to them. This interaction could have substantial implications for disease transmission, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem function.

AB  - Animal migration is a key process underlying active subsidies and species dispersal over long distances, which affects the connectivity and functioning of ecosystems. Despite much research describing patterns of where animals migrate, we still lack a framework for quantifying and predicting how animal migration affects ecosystem processes. In this study, we aim to integrate animal movement behavior and ecosystem functioning by developing a predictive modeling framework that can inform ecosystem management and conservation. We propose a framework to model individual-level migration trajectories between populations' seasonal ranges as well as the resulting dispersal and fate of propagules carried by the migratory animals, which can be calibrated using empirical data at every step of the modeling process. As a case study, we applied our framework to model the spread of guava seeds, Psidium guajava, by a population of migratory Galapagos tortoises, Chelonoidis porteri, across Santa Cruz Island. Galapagos tortoises are large herbivores that transport seeds and nutrients across the island, while Guava is one of the most problematic invasive species in the Galapagos archipelago. Our model can predict the pattern of spread of guava seeds alongside tortoises' downslope migration range, and it identified areas most likely to see establishment success. Our results show that Galapagos tortoises' seed dispersal may particularly contribute to guava range expansion on Santa Cruz Island, due to both long gut retention time and tortoise's long-distance migration across vegetation zones. In particular, we predict that tortoises are dispersing a significant amount of guava seeds into the Galapagos National Park, which has important consequences for the native flora. The flexibility and modularity of our framework allow for the integration of multiple data sources. It also allows for a wide range of applications to investigate how migratory animals affect ecosystem processes, including propagule dispersal but also other processes such as nutrient transport across ecosystems. Our framework is also a valuable tool for predicting how animal-mediated propagule dispersal can be affected by environmental change. These different applications can have important conservation implications for the management of ecosystems that include migratory animals.

AB  - Ecological restoration commonly emphasizes reestablishing native plant communities. Implicit in this approach is the assumption that actively restoring plant communities can passively restore structure and function of other community components like wildlife. However, this assumption is rarely tested. We evaluated how plant restoration in grasslands of the northwestern United States affected the structure (composition and relative abundance) of native small mammal communities and the important functional role they play as seed predators. We quantified vegetation, small mammal community structure, small mammal seed predation, and effects of seed predation on native plant recruitment in comparable grasslands that were either native-dominated, planted with introduced forage grasses, or had undergone restoration treatments to suppress introduced grasses and increase native plants with and without supplemental watering. Native plant cover averaged >= 5 times higher at restoration sites relative to introduced grass sites. Small mammals, primarily deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), were least abundant in introduced grass sites and most abundant in water-supplemented restoration treatments, with intermediate levels in native and unwatered restoration sites. Seed offerings and seed sowing experiments indicated that seed predation and its effects on plant recruitment correlated with small mammal abundance, with effects generally weakest in introduced grass and strongest in restoration sites. Our results suggest that active plant restoration can passively restore the structure and function of native small mammal communities. While small mammal seed predation is a desired long-term function, it can also inhibit restoration efforts. We discuss emerging strategies for mitigating seed predation during restoration seeding.

AB  - The enemy release hypothesis proposes that invasion by exotic plant species is driven by their release from natural enemies (i.e. herbivores and pathogens) in their introduced ranges. However, in many cases, natural enemies, which may be introduced or managed to regulate invasive species, may fail to impact target host populations. Landscape heterogeneity, which can affect both the population dynamics of the pathogen and the susceptibility and the density of hosts, may contribute to why pathogens fail to control hosts despite established negative disease impacts.
   We explored patterns of post-fire infection of the fungal head-smut pathogen Ustilago bullata on the invasive annual cheatgrass Bromus tectorum, which has caused the notorious grass-fire cycle and ecosystem degradation across Western North America. We asked whether infection level was a driver of host density or vice-versa, and how weather affected infection and how spatial patterns of infection varied with time since fire, using a combination of structural equation modelling (SEM), proportional odds modelling and entropy-based local indicator of spatial association (ELSA) on data from >700 plots spanning >100,000 ha remeasured annually for 4 years.
   Observed infection levels increased with greater prior-year cheatgrass cover, and disease severity did not suppress cheatgrass populations. Warm, humid fall/winters and proximity to fire refugia (unburned patches) were associated with more infections. Infection clustering was most evident 2-3 years following fire with warm-wet fall-winter conditions and decreased after two drier, colder winters.
   Synthesis. Severity of fungal disease did not result in measurable reductions of populations of a non-native, invasive host species, cheatgrass, which suggests that natural enemies may not strongly regulate cheatgrass in its introduced range. Landscape heterogeneity associated with disturbance and weather limited population-level infection of hosts by the fungal pathogen. Disturbance (specifically wildfire) and variable weather are key components of this and similar invasion systems, and likely need to be considered when evaluating disease dynamics and potential for natural enemies to influence invasion potential.

AB  - 1. Food chain length provides key information on the flow of nutrients and energy in ecosystems. Variation in food chain length has primarily been explained by environmental drivers such as ecosystem size and productivity. Most insights are obtained from theory or aquatic systems, but the importance of these drivers remains largely untested in terrestrial systems.2. We exploited red wood ant nests markedly differing in size as natural experiments to quantify the drivers of trophic structure and food chain length of their symbiont arthropod communities. Using stable isotopes, we explored the variation in the trophic positions of four symbiont species with the trophic position of the top predator as a proxy for food chain length of the symbiont community.3. Nest size did not affect food chain length, nor trophic distance between the symbionts. Instead, food chain length and the trophic positions of the symbionts were strongly affected by the host's foraging decisions. When the host diet shifted from predominantly herbivorous to more predacious, the trophic position of the symbionts and food chain length strongly increased.4. We show for the first time that a food web can be structured by biotic interactions with an engineering species rather than by abiotic environmental variables.

AB  - Hunting is a method commonly used in several European countries to reduce crop damages by wild boar Sus scrofa. However, results are still controversial and poorly treated. Using data on official claims (i.e., damages to crops) and wild boar local counts and hunting bags collected from 2019 to 2022, the purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of the hunting system (divided into eradication and non-eradication areas) carried out in the north-east of Italy on the number of agricultural damages. The spatio-temporal distribution of wild boar hunting, density and damages as well as the effect of hunting, were evaluated through the hotspot analysis and the zero-inflated models, respectively. The results obtained revealed no clear spatial overlap among wild boar hunting, wild boar density and damages to agriculture in both the eradication and non-eradication areas. Moreover, the current level of harvesting did not significantly affect the number of agricultural damages. A multifaceted approach focused on the numeric control of the species based on accurate local counts and oriented towards more age classes in a similar percentage should be preferred to mitigate damages to cultivars.

AB  - Monitoring ecosystem processes resulting in ecosystem services (ESs) and disservices (EDs) is crucial in agricultural ecosystems. Traditionally, ESs/EDs provided by arthropods have been estimated indirectly by measuring arthropod abundance and diversity, overlooking the recognised limitations of such approach. Using a consistent methodology based on the sentinel approach, we quantified the intensity of five ecological processes leading to four ESs and two EDs in vineyards and citrus orchards on Terceira Island, Azores. We assessed herbivory rates on lettuce plants (ED), predation rates on green plasticine caterpillars by vertebrates and invertebrates (ES), the intensity of insect pollination on strawberry plants (ES), the rates of predation on wheat and dandelion seeds (ED and ES, respectively) by rodents and invertebrates, and decomposition rates using tea and rooibos leaves (ES). Herbivory rates after 2 weeks were significantly lower in vineyards (mean +/- SD; 0.5 +/- 0.6%) than in citrus orchards (3.6 +/- 2.9%). Vertebrate predation rates in vineyards (4.0 +/- 13.6% d(-1)) were significantly higher than in citrus orchards (2.4 +/- 10.7% d(-1)), while no differences were observed for overall and invertebrate predation rates. Pollination efficiency in vineyards (214.5 +/- 23.9 seeds/fruit) was significantly higher than in citrus orchards (162.0 +/- 14.7 seeds/fruit). Seed predation rates were higher, although not significantly so, in citrus orchards (2.0 +/- 5.8% d(-1)) than in vineyards (0.3 +/- 0.8% d(-1)). Decomposition was significantly higher on tea than on rooibos leaves, both in vineyards (1.15 +/- 0.11 g vs. 0.72 +/- 0.16 g) and citrus orchards (1.34 +/- 0.06 g vs. 0.78 +/- 0.13 g); no differences between mass loss in the two habitats were observed. Our results demonstrated the suitability of simple, direct monitoring tools for a quantitative comparison of agricultural habitats, confirm that landscape complexity does not always support ESs, and that the same agro-ecosystem characteristics that support ESs could occasionally also favour EDs.

AB  - Context The population of introduced fallow deer (Dama dama) is thought to have increased exponentially across much of the island of Tasmania, Australia, since 2000. Historically, deer management decisions have relied on population trend data from vehicular spotlight surveys. Renewed focus on the contemporary management of the species requires development of more robust and precise population estimation methodology. Aims This study demonstrates two aerial survey methods - conventional counts by trained human observers, and thermal imaging footage recorded during the same flights - to inform future survey practices. Methods Conventional counts were carried out by three observers, two seated on the left side of the helicopter, and one on the right. A high-resolution thermal camera was fitted to the helicopter and was orientated to meet the assumptions of distance sampling methodologies. Both survey methods were used to generate deer population density estimates. Spatial distribution of deer was also analysed in relation to patches of remnant native vegetation across an agricultural landscape. Mark-recapture distance sampling was used to estimate density from human observer counts and provide a comparison to the distance sampling estimates derived from the thermal camera. Key results Human observer counts gave a density estimate of 2.7 deer per km(2), while thermal camera counts provided an estimate of 2.8 deer per km(2). Deer population density estimates calculated via both methods were similar, but variability of the thermal camera estimate (coefficient of variation (CV) of 36%) was unacceptably high. Human observer data was within acceptable bounds of variability (CV, 19%). The estimated population size in central and north-eastern Tasmania for 2019 approximated 53,000 deer. Deer were primarily congregated within 200 metres of the interface between canopy cover and open pasture. Conclusions The population density estimate provides a baseline for monitoring and managing the Tasmanian deer population. Human observer data was more precise than thermal camera data in this study, but thermal counts could be improved by reducing sources of variability. Implications Improvements for the collection of thermal imagery are recommended. Future control efforts may be more efficient if they preferentially target habitat edges at this time of year, paired with random or grid-based searches where population density is lower.

We studied the effects of land cover change on the conservation of the endangered Ader's Duiker (Cephalophus adersi), the Zanzibar blue duiker (Cephalophus monticola sundevalli) and the Suni (Neotragus moschatus zanzibaricus) in Zanzibar, Tanzania. Data were obtained from the 1975, 2009 and 2014 satellite images and geographical information systems, focus group discussions, transect-walk and observation. We found that the habitat of mini-antelopes had declined from 87.3% to 58.5% between 1975 and 2014 and become fragmented. The forest fragments increased from 35 to 139 patches while shrubs increased from 41 to 199 patches. Community members had the perception that the decline and fragmentation of the habitat had caused the numbers of mini-antelopes and their forage to decline. We also found that there were incidences of mini-antelopes eating crop plants such as cowpeas, yams and tomatoes in the farms during the night as an adaptive mechanism for forage decline. Conclusively, land cover changes from human activities have caused negative effects on the mini-antelopes. There is, therefore need for the local people, the government and private individuals or corporations to introduce collective conservation initiatives, including the establishment of conservation areas to conserve the mini-antelopes.

AB  - Translocation records indicate aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) populations in the United States are a product of multiple human-mediated introductions. Two mitochondrial markers (cytochrome b, cytb; displacement loop, D loop) and one nuclear gene (prion protein gene exon 3, PRNP) were used to determine: (1) genetic variation, (2) if genetic units correspond to taxonomic designations, (3) the number and geographic origin of translocations, and (4) divergence times. Three phylogenetic analyses (Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood, and parsimony) produced similar topologies with two clades (I and II). Clade I contained progeny of individuals resulting from introductions to Texas and Spain, and individuals from Algeria. Individuals in Clade II were progeny of past introductions to the United States and Europe, and northern Algeria. Clade II was subdivided into two subclades (A and B) representing two haplogroups. No genetic variation was detected in the PRNP sequences. Three haplogroups appeared to correspond to the subspecies A. l. lervia and A. l. sahariensis whose native distribution includes northwestern Africa. Network analyses assigned haplogroups to two major groups similar to those depicted in the phylogenetic analyses. Genetic distances ranged from 0.80% to 5.17% and 2.99% to 15.42% for cytb and D loop, respectively; and were higher than normally recovered for caprids, warranting a reexamination of subspecific status. Divergence dates indicated a major split between A. l. lervia and A. l. sahariensis circa 2.38 mya. Together, the high level of genetic divergences among US populations and apparent presence of two subspecies of aoudad in the United States support the hypothesis of multiple introductions from multiple sources.

AB  - Analysis of fossil assemblage structure can help illuminate the processes shaping the assembly of ecological communities. Using Bayesian network analysis methods, we investigated patterns of association between presences and abundances of 12 large-bodied mammal clades at Pleistocene fossil localities and their dependence on local environment types, global temperature estimates, locality ages and large-scale geographic positions. The dependencies among the clades seem to be structured by the degree of generalism in carnivores and omnivores, inter-specific competition-driven ecological differentiation among the carnivores, and local environmental preferences in herbivores. With the exception of hominids, we do not find significant dependencies among the external variables (gross geographic position, age, mean global temperature) and the clades under investigation. We do not find evidence of exclusion between any two clades, which would indicate predation effects or competition at a family or higher level. The network of dependencies among mammalian clades shows a remarkable lack of change over time, pointing to emergent invariability of taxonomic assemblies at the family or higher level despite significant environmental changes.

AB  - Although rarely experimentally tested, biotic interactions have long been hypothesised to limit low-elevation range boundaries of species. We tested the effects of herbivory on three alpine-restricted plant species by transplanting plants below (novel), at the edge (limit), or in the centre (core) of their current elevational range and factorially fencing-out above- and belowground mammals. Herbivore damage was greater in range limit and novel habitats than in range cores. Exclosures increased plant biomass and reproduction more in novel habitats than in range cores, suggesting demographic costs of novel interactions with herbivores. We then used demographic models to project population growth rates, which increased 5-20% more under herbivore exclosure at range limit and novel sites than in core habitats. Our results identify mammalian herbivores as key drivers of the low-elevation range limits of alpine plants and indicate that upward encroachment of herbivores could trigger local extinctions by depressing plant population growth.

AB  - Taxonomic diversity is insufficient to fully characterize species co-existence in forest ecosystems. Incorporating trait-based and phylogenetic data into studies of communities provides insight into the mechanisms by which coexistence emerges and is maintained in forest landscapes. We integrated trait-based and phylogenetic models of community structure to gain insight into community processes in deciduous, mixed, and evergreen forests. We also explored how phylogenetic community structure may vary across environmental gradients within deciduous, mixed, and evergreen forests using a null model approach. Plants appeared to transition from being acquisitive within dry, deciduous forest plots atop fertile soils to becoming more conservative in moist, infertile soil conditions in evergreen forests. We present this as strong evidence of environmental filtering mediating plant community composition. Our models suggest a strong influence of environmental filtering in deciduous forests and competitive exclusion and random processes in mixed and evergreen settings. Besides, thicker leaves, lower SLA, and higher WD in evergreen forests than deciduous forests may reflect adaptation to chronic herbivore pressure-a key biotic filter shaping trait distribution in different forest systems. Our results suggest that phylogeny and functional traits represent different lenses through which one may view community assembly, which should be viewed independently of each other. We suggest future research incorporating both phylogenetic and trait-based perspectives, and possibly even more axes (stress tolerance, etc.) is necessary to provide insight into community assembly.

AB  - Vegetation restoration may increase the soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) but decrease the soil water storage (SWS) of terrestrial ecosystems in arid and semiarid regions. To guarantee the sustainability of restoration, it is critical to evaluate the coupling interaction of SOCS and SWS. Here, we examined the spatial distributions of SOCS and SWS across a 0-200 cm soil profile in a grassland, forestland and shrubland on the Loess Plateau and determined the driving factors that affected their variations. Our results showed that SOCS and SWS varied across the 0-200 cm soil profile and considerably accumulated in the deep soil layers (100-200 cm). In comparison to SOCS, SWS generally had higher relative benefits in most studied plant communities, which ensured sustainable restoration. In addition, land use played a less important role than local environmental conditions in determining the variations in SOCS and SWS. Specifically, the interaction between SOCS and SWS was mainly strong in the surface soil layers (0-20 cm). Topography was a predominant factor that affected SOCS and SWS in the deep soil layers (100-200 cm), while soil texture was a stable driving factor influencing their variations across the whole soil profile (0-200 cm). Given the low moisture consumption of grasslands and the lowest root mean square deviation (RMSD) of Hippophae rhamnoides, we proposed an advanced scenario for ecological restoration on the Loess Plateau: establishing reasonably large Hippophae rhamnoides patches with fewer edges in a contiguous grassland matrix. Furthermore, this scenario should be tailored to local environmental conditions, such as soil water, texture and topography, followed by natural vegetation succession.

   Today, expansive C-4 grassy biomes exist across central, western, and northern Madagascar. Some researchers have argued that the island's now-extinct pygmy hippopotamuses belonged to a megaherbivore grazing guild that maintained these grasslands prior to human arrival. However, the chemistry of hippo bones indicates that C-4 grasses were only a minor part of hippo diet. This, in turn, suggests that C-4 grasses were present but not widespread when hippos were alive and that grasses expanded only after Malagasy people shifted from hunting and foraging to agropastoralism approximately 1000 years ago. These results have important implications for environmental reconstructions and biodiversity management.
   Summary
   center dot Extinct hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus spp.) were part of Madagascar's megaherbivore guild. Stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes in radiometrically dated bone collagen track spatial and temporal variation in diet and habitat. If hippos helped maintain C-4 grassy biomes, then they should have regularly consumed C-4 grasses, which have high delta C-13 values. However, if expansive C-4 grassy biomes are anthropogenic, then forests would have been more extensive in the past, and hippos would have predominantly consumed C-3 plants with low delta C-13 values. Nitrogen isotopes can clarify foraging habitat (moist or dry).
   center dot We assessed delta C-13 and delta N-15 values for hippos from different ecoregions of Madagascar and compared these with data for extinct herbivorous lemurs from the same ecoregions. We further explored the effects of wet/dry transitions on isotopic trends for hippos from the central highlands and spiny thicket ecoregions.
   center dot Carbon isotopes suggest (1) limited C-4 consumption by hippos in the central highlands, dry deciduous forest, and succulent woodland ecoregions; and (2) moderate consumption of C-4 resources in the spiny thicket. Nitrogen data indicate that hippos foraged in wetter habitats than sympatric lemurs in all regions.
   center dot Malagasy hippos did not regularly graze C-4 grasses in dry, open habitats, even in regions blanketed by C-4 grassy biomes today. Malagasy grasses are adapted to grazing and fire, but these are likely ancient adaptations that accompanied grasses when they initially spread to Madagascar. C-4 grassy biomes were spatially limited in extent in the past and only expanded after the Late Holocene introduction of domesticated ungulates.

AB  - Introduced predators may affect native arthropod communities and alter the ecosystem services these native species provide. While mantids are known to have a broad diet in terms of consuming taxa from a number of different orders, we currently lack the high taxonomic resolution on the prey species consumed. Without knowing the identity and frequency of species in the diets of introduced mantids, it is difficult to estimate the ecological impacts of these species on local food webs and ecosystem services. To address these issues, we used DNA metabarcoding to identify prey in the diets of two introduced mantids (Tenodera sinensis and Mantis reli-giosa) in old fields. While both species fed on a broad diversity of taxa across 22 orders, T. sinensis mantids exhibited higher alpha diversity in diet items than M. religiosa mantids. Total beta diversity of mantid diets was moderate (0.39-0.485) across both species, although M. religiosa samples exhibited higher total beta diversity than T. sinensis samples. Herbivorous, predatory and pollinator prey species were the most important contrib-utors to detected patterns of beta diversity. However, degree of diet overlap varied across sites and mantid species, where mantid diets at sites dominated by the same species of mantid were more similar than compared to mantid diets at sites dominated by a different mantid species.

AB  - The information on the number of mammalian species introduced and established into the Neotropical Region and the knowledge on their history of introduction and ecological-genetic aspects are rather variable. To improve our understanding on these topics, we provide an updated list of mammalian species that have established wild populations in the Neotropics and, where possible, compare genetic variability between native and introduced populations in order to evaluate whether the genetic paradox of invasions (GPI) applies to these species. Our search exposed an evident lack of genetic data for most populations introduced in the Neotropics, which restricted our analysis to 10 out of the 51 mammalian species introduced and to only three neutral molecular markers. Losses of genetic variability were a frequent feature of introduced populations, suggesting that these populations have overcome low genetic variation and successfully established in the new environment adding support to the conditions needed to be considered paradoxical in the sense of the GPI. However, it was not possible to affirm that the magnitude of the loss is related to the number of introduction events or the number of individuals introduced or translocated. Alternative approaches to obtain better estimates of genetic diversity associated with the evolutionary potential of the species at the initial stages of invasion are needed.

AB  - The return of large carnivores to areas with strong anthropogenic impact often results in conflicts among different interest groups. One cause of conflict is that large carnivores compete with humans for wild game species. In Scandinavia, the recolonization of wolves (Canis lupus) and brown bears (Ursus arctos) has important ramifications for the harvest of an ungulate species with high economic and recreational value, the moose. We estimated wolf and brown bear predation rates on moose (Alces alces) relative to harvest, natural causes of death, and vehicle collisions within 20 wolf territories. We used data on multi-season kill rates of wolves and brown bears on moose combined with wolf territory sizes and estimates of the population density of brown bears and moose. Wolf predation rate on moose was not related to the density of moose, wolf pack size, nor kill rate but was positively related to wolf density and strongly negatively related to the abundance of moose within wolf territories. Estimated annual wolf and brown bear predation rates averaged 8.6% (range 2.8%-16.9%) and 2.3% (range 0%-12.7%) respectively, among wolf territories, whereas estimated annual harvest rates averaged 17.5% (range 8.1%-33.1%). In wolf territories with relatively high bear densities, the combined predation rates from wolves and brown bears exceeded harvest rates. Across wolf territories, harvest rates were not related to wolf predation rates or to the combined predation rates from wolves and brown bears, indicating that large carnivore predation and harvest were not compensatory to each other at this spatial level. The recolonization of these large carnivores in the Scandinavian boreal forest ecosystem may have small to significant consequences for the sustainable management of moose populations depending on the local conditions of both wolves, brown bears, and moose. Comparison of annual mortality rates for moose in our study in Scandinavia with corresponding data from areas with lower anthropogenic impact (Alaska) shows lower total mortality rates in Scandinavia. This likely results from a different age and sex composition of moose killed by wolves and brown bears versus harvest, in combination with a significant difference in the relative importance of these mortality factors between areas.

AB  - The Golan Heights in the north of Israel is home to golden jackals (Canis aureus) and a resurgent wolf population (Canis lupus), along with intensive cattle ranching. Free-roaming livestock guarding dogs (LGDs; Canis lupus familiaris) are used in some ranches as a non-lethal measure to mitigate predation, which also causes concern about their negative impact on endangered mountain gazelles (Gazella gazella). This study assumed that in open pastures (without protective fences), LGDs could promote the persistence of gazelles by displacing jackals that prey on gazelle fawns. Camera traps were undertaken in the summer and autumn 2023 in 4 pastures with LGDs and 4 pastures without LGDs. Gazelles preferred LGD pastures, despite the increased presence of jackals and the presence of wolves. Within the LGD pastures, gazelles had a positive interaction with LGDs, and jackals had a negative interaction with LGDs and were more alert. Fawn:gazelle ratio was highest in the LGD pastures, and higher than in pastures with protective fences and other sites with lower jackal densities. The findings show that the presence of LGDs supports higher gazelle densities and recruitment, possibly creating a landscape of fear for the jackals that are either drawn to the gazelles or experiencing mesopredator release. We suggest further study of jackal and wolf movement in response to LGDs to assess the effect of humans on predator-prey interactions and its implications for both ranching and wildlife conservation in pastoral landscapes.

AB  - The removal or addition of a predator in an ecosystem can trigger a trophic cascade, whereby the predator indirectly influences plants and/or abiotic processes via direct effects on its herbivore prey. A trophic cascade can operate through a density-mediated indirect effect (DMIE), where the predator reduces herbivore density via predation, and/or through a trait-mediated indirect effect (TMIE), where the predator induces an herbivore trait response that modifies the herbivore's effect on plants. Manipulative experiments suggest that TMIEs are an equivalent or more important driver of trophic cascades than are DMIEs. Whether this applies generally in nature is uncertain because few studies have directly compared the magnitudes of TMIEs and DMIEs on natural unmanipulated field patterns. A TMIE is often invoked to explain the textbook trophic cascade involving wolves (Canis lupus), elk (Cervus canadensis), and aspen (Populus tremuloides) in northern Yellowstone National Park. This hypothesis posits that wolves indirectly increase recruitment of young aspen into the overstory primarily through reduced elk browsing in response to spatial variation in wolf predation risk rather than through reduced elk population density. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects of spatiotemporal variation in wolf predation risk and temporal variation in elk population density on unmanipulated patterns of browsing and recruitment of young aspen across 113 aspen stands over a 21-year period (1999-2019) in northern Yellowstone National Park. Only 2 of 10 indices of wolf predation risk had statistically meaningful effects on browsing and recruitment of young aspen, and these effects were 8-28 times weaker than the effect of elk density. To the extent that temporal variation in elk density was attributable to wolf predation, our results suggest that the wolf-elk-aspen trophic cascade was primarily density-mediated rather than trait-mediated. This aligns with the alternative hypothesis that wolves and other actively hunting predators with broad habitat domains cause DMIEs to dominate whenever prey, such as elk, also have a broad habitat domain. For at least this type of predator-prey community, our study suggests that risk-induced trait responses can be abstracted or ignored while still achieving an accurate understanding of trophic cascades.

AB  - Seeds and seedlings are the most critical stages of cacti life cycles. From the thousands of seeds produced in a reproductive season, only a small fraction successfully germinate, the rest are lost to predation, go dormant, and remain viable in the seed bank, or lose viability. These early stages often depend on facilitation by nurse plants for germination and seedling recruitment. We aim to prescribe actions for the conservation of Cephalocereus polylophus by improving recruitment in the population. The viability of seeds with different storage times was evaluated as an indicator of their potential to form a short-term seed bank. Through the analysis of seed germination and seedling survival under the canopy of two nurse plant species and open areas, we assessed the importance of facilitation for recruitment. A predator exclusion experiment evaluated the intensity of granivory and herbivory on seedlings of different ages. Seeds had germination rates above 90% under laboratory conditions, even after 2 years of storage. Seed germination was only registered under one of the two nurses and after 2 years, up to 4% of the seedlings planted under both nurse plants survived. Age and protection against herbivores increased seedlings survival. Facilitation and age are crucial for the recruitment of C. polylophus, and future conservation programs should include the protection of plant communities and the introduction of seedlings instead of seeds.

AB  - Kelp aquaculture is an emerging industry outside of Asia. To be successful, this industry requires a reliable production of seedstock, the optimisation of which greatly benefits from a detailed physiological understanding of the microscopic life-cycle stages of the cultured species. This study investigated the impact of six zoospore densities (10-278 mm(-2)) on the subsequent development of Ecklonia radiata gametophytes and sporophytes. The results showed that germination rates and sex ratio were unaffected by initial zoospore density, but there were significant effects on gametophyte size and sporophyte production. After two weeks, female gametophytes were largest at an initial zoospore density of 40 mm(-2) while male gametophytes grew largest at densities below 40 mm(-2), but after four weeks gametophyte size showed a negative relationship with initial zoospore density. Significantly more sporophytes developed at initial zoospore densities below 40 individuals mm(-2) and no sporophytes were observed at the highest density (271 zoospores mm(-2)). These results clearly show the importance of initial zoospore density in optimising the nursery stage of kelp aquaculture.

AB  - We still know little about the distributions of trace elements in grassland with long-term grazing exclusion. The contents, stocks, and proportions of iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), manganese (Mn), and boron (B) in green plant-litter-root-soil were evaluated by enclosing for 18-, and 39 years inside the fence (F18 and F39) and grazing outside the fence (F0) in Mongolia grassland. Results showed that F18 and F39 decreased the stocks of Fe, Al, and Mn in green plant and root compared with F0 (p < .05), while increased the stocks of them in litter (p < .05). The F18 obviously increased the stocks of Fe and Mn in soil, especially B (p < .05). The stock of Fe, Al, and Mn in green plant at F39 was 28.6%, 13.9%, and 39.2% higher than that at F18. The stocks of trace elements in undecomposed litter at F39 were increased by 12.7%-52.2% compared with F18, while the stocks of them in complete decomposed litter were decreased by 32.2%-42.5%. The stocks of trace elements in soil at F39 were 9.1%-28.0% lower than that at F18, especially B (p < .05). In conclusion, the trace elements were mainly shifted from green plant and root to soil and complete decomposed litter with 18-year grazing exclusion. The trace elements were shifted from complete decomposed litter and soil to root with 39-year grazing exclusion compared with 18-year grazing exclusion.

AB  - Nyungwe National Park (NNP) is one of Rwanda's largest remaining tropical forests. Due to the increasing threats from human activities, the park's biodiversity has been severely affected. In 1999, elephants were removed from the park due to these threats. This study, therefore, intends to analyze the human-driven extinction of elephants in Nyungwe National Park, Rwanda from 1965 to 1999. The results revealed that the human activities that lead to the extinction of elephants in Nyungwe include: Poaching for ivory trade at 75%, poaching for bushmeat at 20,6%, poaching for traditional medicine at 2,7% and poaching for decoration at the late 0,8%. The illegal human-driven activities that led to elephant extinction were Poaching, Gold Mining and Logging/tree harvesting. These activities were promoted by Poaching for Ivory Trading, Poaching for Bushmeat, Poverty and Human-elephants conflicts. All of these degraded elephant habitats in various locations such as Kamiranzovu, Gasare, Bigugu and eventually resulted in the extinction of elephants in NNP. Conservation efforts that exist today in Nyungwe National Park need to be reinforced mainly for threatened species so that they may not become extinct from Nyungwe as well and reintroduction of elephants in Nyungwe is needed for sustainable conservation of Nyungwe's biodiversity and tourism product development. In addition to this, an assessment of habitat quality in areas formerly occupied by elephants in Nyungwe is also needed as a prerequisite for elephant re-introduction planning and implementation.

AB  - Simple Summary Nutrias (Myocastor coypus) escaped captivity in the 1990s in Korea; these individuals rapidly established wild populations, causing substantial environmental issues, including biodiversity loss, local habitat disturbance, and agricultural damage. The South Korean government initiated the Nutria Eradication Project in 2014 to control nutrias on a national scale. The aim of this research was to support the eradication efforts by improving our understanding of nutria movements based on biological and environmental factors. In this study, the geo-self-organizing map software was applied to radio-tracking data from individuals, and it was determined that males dominate nutria movement. Movement patterns were seasonal and varied with vegetation types between sexes and within each sex. Tall grassland was mainly associated with interactions between individuals of opposite sexes (possibly related to mating), whereas floating-leaved hydrophytes were related to same-sex interactions (possible feeding grounds). Data from this large-scale monitoring provide initial results for a more targeted and effective eradication program. Further large-scale population dynamics research is needed for a successful eradication program in the future. Nutrias (Myocastor coypus) were imported to South Korea for farming in 1985; individuals escaped captivity and established wild populations in natural ecosystems in the late 1990s. Numerous studies have focused on their monitoring and management; however, information on the continuous movement of individuals is not available. In this study, telemetry data from field conditions were used to identify the nearest-neighbor distances of individuals in association with environmental factors, including plant type, land cover, and biological parameters. The minimum nearest-neighbor distances for the different sexes were, overall, according to the minimum distances for the same sex. Local co-occurrences of individuals, either of the same or different sex, were seasonal. Tall grasslands, followed by herbaceous vegetation, were associated with the co-occurrence of different sexes. Conversely, floating-leaved hydrophytes, followed by xeric herbaceous vegetation, were correlated with the co-occurrence of the same sex. Local female-male co-occurrences were negatively associated with male-male co-occurrences but not with female-female co-occurrences, suggesting male dominance in group formations. Movement and co-occurrence information extracted using Geo-self-organizing maps furthers our understanding of population dispersal and helps formulate management strategies for nutria populations.

AB  - Animal movement can mediate the ecological consequences of fragmentation; however, barriers such as fences, roads, and railways are becoming a pervasive threat to wildlife. Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) habitat in western North America has been fragmented by roads, railways, and fences. Although pronghorn are sensitive to barriers, neither the relative permeability of different barriers to crossing nor their influence on space use have been quantified. We used a large global positioning system (GPS)-collar dataset of pronghorn (n = 1,010 animal-years) in Wyoming, USA, to first quantify the likelihood that pronghorn cross each of 5 different anthropogenic barriers, including fences, county roads, railroads, state highways, and interstate highways (i.e., interstates). Next, we assessed how each barrier influenced pronghorn space use during the winter as indexed by the area occupied, and daily displacement relative to the density of barriers on an individual's winter range. The semi-permeability of the 5 barriers varied substantially, with the interstate being the most severe barrier to pronghorn movement. Pronghorn were >300 times less likely to cross interstates compared to state highways. Although pronghorn space use was rarely influenced by barriers within individual core winter ranges, pronghorn space use was constrained by barriers on the buffered periphery of individual winter ranges. Despite their different permeability to movement, the density of fences and combined interstates and railroads had similarly negative effects on pronghorn space use. Our results illustrate that the degree to which pronghorn avoid crossing barriers may scale up to affect access to habitat. Additionally, our results indicate that the effects of barriers on habitat access are not proportional to their permeability. Our results add to a growing consensus that effective management of mobile species depends on understanding how different kinds of semi-permeable barriers influence access and use of habitats.

AB  - Abiotic and biotic factors influence seagrass resilience, but the strength and relative importance of the effects are rarely assessed over the complete lifecycle. This study examined the effects of abiotic (salinity, temperature, water depth) and biotic (grazing by black swans) factors on Ruppia spp. over the complete lifecycle. Structures were set up in two estuaries ( - 33.637020, 115.412608) that prevented and allowed natural swan grazing of the seagrasses in May 2019, before the start of the growing season. The density of life stage(s) was measured from June 2019 when germination commenced through to January 2020 when most of the seagrass senesced. Our results showed that swans impacted some but not all life stages. Seedling densities were significantly higher in the plots that allowed natural grazing compared to the exclusion plots (e.g. 697 versus 311 seedlings per m-2), revealing an apparent benefit of swans. Swans removed <= 10% of seagrass vegetation but a dormant seedbank was present and new propagules were also observed. We conclude that grazing by swans provides some benefit to seagrass resilience by enhancing seedling recruitment. We further investigated the drivers of the different lifecycle stages using general additive mixed models. Higher and more variable salinity led to increased seed germination whilst temperature explained variation in seedling density and adult plant abundance. Bet-hedging strategies of R. polycarpa were revealed by our lifecycle assessment including the presence of a dormant seedbank, germinated seeds and seedlings over the 8-month study period over variable conditions (salinity 2-42 ppt; temperatures 11-28 degrees C). These strategies may be key determinants of resilience to emerging salinity and temperature regimes from a changing climate.

AB  - Trophic rewilding provides a nature-based solution for biological conservation; however, empirical studies demonstrating rewilding effects are limited. Megaherbivores moderate the type and quality of habitat available to other fauna. However, these effects may take time to develop. Further, fauna responses to megaherbivore rewilding will depend on a suite of life-history traits and strategies that allow persistence within megaherbivore modified landscapes. We conducted a space-for-time field survey in South African savanna to determine if habitat modifications mediated by a reintroduced megaherbivore, the African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana), impacts the abundance of the diurnal arboreal cape dwarf gecko (Lygodactylus capensis) and two generalist diurnal skinks [the variable skink (Trachylepis varia) and striped skink (Trachylepis striata), collectively] across a 47-year period. The relative abundance of lizards and six habitat attributes utilized by lizards were assessed at 30 sites stratified across three biophysically and climatically similar nature reserves with different elephant reintroduction times (no elephants, 2003, 1972). The arboreal gecko was less common at the reserve with an older reintroduction time than the other reserves and was most commonly observed on, and positively correlated with, the density of the corkwood tree (Commiphora mollis). The generalist skinks were common across all reserves and were observed in a variety of habitats. Our results suggest that elephant rewilding differently impacts lizard species with different life-history strategies and that these effects take prolonged periods to develop. Given such knowledge, a long-term understanding of post-rewilding interactions will be a key point when designing and assessing the success of rewilding initiatives.

AB  - Rangelands worldwide have been subject to broadscale modification, such as widespread predator control, introduction of permanent livestock water and altered vegetation to improve grazing. In Australia, these landscape changes have resulted in kangaroos (i.e. large macropods) populations increasing over the past 200 years. Kangaroos are a key contributor to total grazing pressure and in conjunction with livestock and feral herbivores have been linked to land degradation. We used 22 years of aerial survey data to investigate whether the density of 3 macropod species in the southern rangelands of Western Australia was associated with: (i) land use, including type of livestock, total livestock, density of feral goats, type of land tenure, and kangaroo commercial harvest effort; (ii) predator management, including permitted dingo control effort, estimated dingo abundance, and presence of the State Barrier Fence (a dingo exclusion fence); and (iii) environmental variables: ruggedness, rainfall, fractional cover, and total standing dry matter. Red kangaroos (Osphranter rufus) were most abundant in flat, open vegetation, on pastoral land, where area permitted for dingo control was high, and numbers were positively associated with antecedent rainfall with a 12-month delay. Western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) were most abundant on flat, agricultural land, but less abundant in areas with high permitted dingo control. Euros (Osphranter robustus) were most abundant in rugged pastoral land with open vegetation, where permitted dingo control was high. While environmental variables are key drivers of landscape productivity and kangaroo populations, anthropogenic factors such as land use and permitted dingo control are strongly associated with kangaroo abundance.

AB  - Pasture biomass and quality are dependent on herbivore grazing and precipitation, but the responses of vegetation to the interactive effects of climate and grazing regimes remain unclear. We conducted an eight-year sheep grazing experiment with 4 stocking rates (0, 3.5, 5.5, and 7.5 sheep/ha) in an alpine meadow of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and forage nutritional value (FNV) of four dominant species (Poa annua, Kobresia humilis, Astragalus adsurgens and Potentilla fruticosa) were measured during a wet year (360 mm rainfall) and a drought year (216 mm rainfall). The FNV was used as indicator of forage quality and was calculated from the crude protein (CP) content, in vitro true dry matter digestibility (IVTD), metabolic energy (ME) yield, and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content of the plant. The stocking rate explained a minimum of 76% of the variations of ANPP, and the precipitation sub-additive effect for ANPP ranged from 5% to 12%. The interaction of sheep stocking rate and precipitation affected ANPP of the 4 species, except for P. fruticosa. The FNV of the pasture increased with increasing grazing pressure, but ANPP and forage nutritional yield (FNY) decreased. In calculating FNY, the increase in FNV did not compensate for the decrease in ANPP. In non-grazed plots, the CP yield declined sharply (18%-55%) in response to drought, but there was no effect on ME yield. The interaction between stocking rate and precipitation affected forage quality of the 4 plant species differently. The grassland ANPP and FNY could be maintained at a grazing intensity of 3.5 sheep/ha in wet and dry years. Our results highlight that stocking density affects pasture ANPP and FNV, and is contingent on rainfall.

AB  - Al-Wusta Wildlife Reserve (WWR) is the first wildlife reserve in Oman. It was established in 1980 for reintroduction and breeding of the Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx) and recently other wildlife, which includes the Arabian gazelle (Gazelle gazelle cora) and Sand gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa marica). These antelopes are only kept in a few countries worldwide. Therefore, only limited information is available on their husbandry requirements and diseases occurring in these species. This study aimed to evaluate the causes of mortalities at WWR. During July to October 2019, fifty mortalities were observed at WWR. These mortalities consisted of 10 Arabian oryx and 40 Sand gazelles. All carcasses were subjected to the detailed post-mortem (PM) examination to find out the potential cause of death. Fatal injuries caused by fighting were the major cause of deaths (n=17, 34%) followed by cyclone related deaths (n=10, 20%), pneumonia (n=8, 16%), old age (n=4, 8%), impaction of stomach caused by foreign bodies (n=3, 6%) and bloat (n=2, 4%). The exact cause of death could not be established in 5 (10%) mortalities. Internal organs were screened for the presence of adult worms. However, no parasite was observed in these animals. These findings demonstrated that more than 50% mortalities could be reduced by only controlling aggression-related injuries and taking precautionary measures against natural disasters like a cyclone. On the other hand, the absence of internal worms could be related to good husbandry conditions at WWR.

AB  - Reversing biodiversity loss is a global imperative that requires setting aside sufficient space for species. In South Africa, an estimated area of 20 million ha is under wildlife ranching, a form of private land enterprise that adopts wildlife-based land uses for commercial gain. This land has potential to contribute towards biodiversity conservation, but the extent to which this occurs has not been evaluated. Using structured questionnaires of 226 wildlife ranchers, we assessed how the sector contributes towards the conservation of ungulates and elephants (hereafter herbivores). Overall, 40 herbivore species were present across the sample, where individual ranches had a mean of 15.0 (+/- 4.8) species, 1.9 (+/- 1.5) threatened species, and 3.6 (+/- 3.1) extralimital species per property. In comparison to 54 state PAs, wildlife ranches had significantly higher species richness, more threatened species but more extralimital species when property/reserve size was controlled for. Ranches conducting trophy hunting had similar species richness and numbers of extralimital species per ha, but fewer threatened species when compared to ranches conducting ecotourism. We estimate that 4.66-7.25 million herbivores occur on ranches nationally, representing one of the few examples on earth where indigenous mammal populations are thriving and demonstrating how sustainable use can lead to rewilding. We discuss the potential negative impacts of widespread game fencing on landscape fragmentation and gene flow, as well as how the widespread occurrence of extralimital species may lead to hybridisation, biotic homogenisation, and changes to vegetation dynamics. Despite these challenges, commercial wildlife ranching offers a viable option for conserving large mammalian herbivore biodiversity.

AB  - Treelines are expected to expand into alpine ecosystems with global warming, but herbivory may delay this expansion. This study quantifies long-term effects of temporally varying sheep densities on birch recruitment and growth in the treeline ecotone. We examined treeline ecotone successional trajectories and legacy effects in a replicated experimental setup, where enclosures were present for 14 years with three different sheep densities (0, 25, 80 sheep km(-2)). Before and after the enclosures were present, the site had an ambient sheep density of 20-25 km(-2). We sampled field data 4 years after enclosure removal and compared these to data sampled 8 and 9 years after enclosure erection. We sampled data on birch browsing pressure, birch distribution across life-stages (recruits, saplings, and mature trees), and birch annual radial growth. Fourteen years of increased or decreased sheep density had observable legacy effects depending on birch life-stage. Birch recruit prevalence decreased in areas, where sheep were reintroduced after being absent for 14 years. For the same areas, sapling and mature tree prevalence increased, indicating that these areas have entered alternative successional trajectories compared to areas, where sheep were present the whole time. Birch annual radial growth showed a lag effect of 2 years after enclosure removal, with growth decreasing in areas where sheep had been absent for 14 years and increasing where sheep densities were high. Thus, decadal-scale absences of herbivores can leave legacy effects due to increased numbers of trees that have high resistance to later-introduced herbivore browsing.

AB  - Australia and its islands have a long history of fire, which has shaped their ecosystems and unique species. Fire patterns in Australia have changed since European settlement in 1788 with land use and climate changes. Australia has over 9000 islands, which serve as safe havens for threatened species conservation. Nevertheless, their recent fire histories and characteristics remains understudied. We used remote sensing and long-term governmental datasets to study spatiotemporal variation in fire characteristics across Australia's islands. We examined human activity and lightning patterns as predictors of fire characteristics on islands. We then examined the correspondence between island fire metrics and their threatened species richness. We found that a quarter of all Australian islands with an area over 1 km2 for which remote sensing fire data was available (n = 167 islands) had at least 10 fire events over the past two decades. This includes large fires that burnt substantial island areas, such as the 2020 wildfires on K'gari (Fraser Island) and the 2019/2020 wildfires on Kangaroo Island. These fires burnt 31 % and 40 % of the islands, respectively. Human population size was an important predictor of fire intensity. Threatened species were associated with islands with higher fire intensities and larger burnt areas. While some Australian island species may benefit from fire, large and intense fires may lead to species declines and jeopardize the role of islands as safe havens and refuges for threatened species. Further knowledge sharing between researchers, practitioners, Indigenous peoples and additional stakeholders can support future management of fire and threatened species on islands.

AB  - The long-term survival of critically endangered species depends on a blend of in-situ and ex-situ conservation efforts. We studied the Northern River Terrapin (Batagur baska) in the Sundarban Tiger Reserve (STR), India, to assess the potential for future reintroduction by identifying suitable habitats. We carried out intensive field survey, followed by questionnaire to assess the current status of the species. Subsequently, we assess the previously known nesting beaches of B. baska for future reintroduction . No direct evidence of B.baska was found during our boat and beach survey. However, questionnaire surveys reported sightings of the species from Kendo and Chaimari Islands. Our species distribution model (SDM) indicates that only about 5 % of suitable habitat lies within designated protected areas (PAs) in India, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. Mangrove cover was identified as the most critical factor influencing B. baska occurrence. In India, the most suitable habitats are in West Bengal, followed by parts of Odisha. Few nesting beaches within STR show potential, but threats from human disturbance, free ranging dogs, and wild boars may limit their suitability. Reducing these pressures is essential to improve nesting success. The ongoing captive breeding program in STR, which houses around 400 individuals, offers a significant opportunity for species recovery. We recommend focusing future reintroduction efforts at historical nesting sites such as Chaimari, Garanghati, Bagmara in STR, and the Bhitarkanika Conservation Area in Odisha. To ensure success, sustained beach monitoring, community engagement, reduction of anthropogenic activities, and comprehensive reintroduction plans are critical to preventing the extinction of B. baska in the region.

AB  - Ashworthius sidemi is a nematode characteristic for cervids native to the mainland of eastern Asia like particular subspecies of sika deer (Cervus nippon) including Dybowski's sika deer (C. n. hortulorum). With the translocation of so-called 'mainland' sika deer and/or Maral deer (C. canadensis sibiricus) that had previously been kept with Dybowski's sika deer in deer farms in the former Soviet Union, the parasite was transferred to Europe and reported in the 1970s from current Czechia, central Russia and the Ukraine. The fall of the 'Iron Curtain' in the 1990s allowed for the exchange of deer between neighboring Bohemia, Czechia and Bavaria, Germany, which was associated with the introduction of the invasive very pathogenic giant liver fluke, Fascioloides magna, to Bavaria and the establishment of sika deer. Studies on the epidemiology of fascioloidosis prompted the characterization of the overall helminth fauna of red deer from two localities in the border region to Bohemia - Upper Palatinate Forest (13 deer, collected 2011 to 2013) and Bavarian Forest National Park (eight deer, collected 2022) - where F. magna was first confirmed in 2011 and in 2019, respectively. The nematode spectrum was overall characterized by cervid-adapted species with polymorphic ostertagids dominating the abomasal nematode community. Among the 15 species of nematodes recovered from the gastrointestinal tract, however, was the Haemonchus-like A. sidemi which has been recorded for the first time in Germany. Noticeably, A. sidemi was the only nematode that was found in all animals with counts (range, 15 to 765) comparable to the cervid-adapted ostertagid species and made up approximately 25% of the total gastrointestinal nematode burden of the red deer from both areas. In addition to gastrointestinal nematodes, Setaria cervi, F. magna, and Dictyocaulus, Varestrongylus and Elaphostrongylus species infections were recorded. In conclusion, this work shows that A. sidemi established in red deer in Germany and forms a substantial portion of the gastrointestinal nematode burden. Further studies are encouraged to monitor the spread of A. sidemi and to better understand its role in the parasite community of wild ungulates in Europe and the relevance of the infection for both wild and domestic ruminants. To facilitate future research on A. sidemi, a synopsis of references on the worldwide occurrence and host range of the nematode is provided.

AB  - Chromosomal inversions are an important form of structural variation that can affect recombination, chromosome structure and fitness. However, because inversions can be challenging to detect, the prevalence and hence the significance of inversions segregating within species remains largely unknown, especially in natural populations of mammals. Here, by combining population-genomic and long-read sequencing analyses in a single, widespread species of deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), we identified 21 polymorphic inversions that are large (1.5-43.8 Mb) and cause near-complete suppression of recombination when heterozygous (0-0.03 cM Mb(-1)). We found that inversion breakpoints frequently occur in centromeric and telomeric regions and are often flanked by long inverted repeats (0.5-50 kb), suggesting that they probably arose via ectopic recombination. By genotyping inversions in populations across the species' range, we found that the inversions are often widespread and do not harbour deleterious mutational loads, and many are likely to be maintained as polymorphisms by divergent selection. Comparisons of forest and prairie ecotypes of deer mice revealed 13 inversions that contribute to differentiation between populations, of which five exhibit significant associations with traits implicated in local adaptation. Taken together, these results show that inversion polymorphisms have a significant impact on recombination, genome structure and genetic diversity in deer mice and likely facilitate local adaptation across the widespread range of this species.
   The identification of 21 large inversion polymorphisms in populations of deer mice shows that they are widespread, important for patterns of recombination and likely to be involved in local adaptation.

AB  - Oystershell scale (OSS; Lepidosaphes ulmi) is an emerging invasive insect that poses a serious threat to conservation of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) in the southwestern US. Although OSS has been an urban pest in the US since the 1700s, it has recently spread into natural aspen stands in northern Arizona, where outbreaks are causing dieback and mortality. We quantified the ongoing outbreak of OSS at two scales: (1) local severity at two sites and (2) regional distribution across northern Arizona. Our regional survey indicated that OSS is widespread in lower elevation aspen stands and is particularly pervasive in ungulate exclosures. Advanced regeneration had the highest levels of infestation and mortality, which is concerning because this size class is an underrepresented component of aspen stands in northern Arizona. If OSS continues to spread and outbreaks result in dieback and mortality like we observed, then aspen in the southwestern US, and perhaps beyond, will be threatened. Three interacting factors contribute to OSS's potential as a high-impact invasive insect that could spread rapidly: (1) its hypothesized role as a sleeper species, (2) potential interactions between OSS and climate change, and (3) the species' polyphagous nature. Invasive pests like OSS pose an imminent threat to native tree species and, therefore, represent an immediate research and monitoring priority. We conclude with recommendations for future research and monitoring in order to understand OSS's biology in natural aspen stands, quantify impacts, limit future spread, and mitigate mortality and loss of aspen and other host species.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Nervilia nipponica Makino (mukago-saishin) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the International Biological Flora: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to the environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, conservation and global heterogeneity.
   Nervilia nipponica is a small, stoloniferous, seasonally dormant herb that grows in the understorey of evergreen forests in the humid subtropical zone of central and western Japan, with a few outlying populations on Jeju Island in South Korea. Its northern extent is defined by the 0 degrees C winter isotherm, and its occurrence is also limited by site aspect and incline. It is a weak competitor that occupies species-poor microsites in which bare ground and leaf litter predominate. Plant numbers tend to decline as percentage ground cover of surrounding understorey vegetation increases.
   The inflorescence sprouts from a short-lived, subterranean tuber in late spring and leaf-flush occurs after fruit-set. However, most tubers do not flower in any one annual growth cycle. Long-term monitoring of individually marked plants suggests that tubers are resource-limited and that flowering constrains future genet growth. Nervilia nipponica is exclusively autogamous and has a strong capacity for vegetative propagation. The species is genetically depauperate but exhibits significant differentiation between populations, which comprise clonal clusters in phalanx formation.
   The level of mycorrhizal infection differs between plant parts and through successive phenological stages. Stable isotope signatures indicate that the species is partially mycoheterotrophic, with fungal partners supporting growth particularly at lower light intensities. Despite this, falling light availability associated with forest succession can lead to population decline.
   Populations tend to be small and prone to extirpation, but the species is probably under-recorded as a result of its ephemeral emergence above-ground and inconspicuous habit. Management interventions likely to benefit the species at the site level include thinning dense forest canopy and removing encroaching ground cover.

AB  - The persistence of Pacific coral reefs is threatened by large-scale mortality resulting from heat stress, storms, overfishing, disease, and land-based pollution. While reefs have demonstrated the ability to recover from these disturbances, recovery potential is highly variable; in part driven by the high spatial variability in the abundance of coral juveniles. However, our understanding of the patterns and predictors of juvenile coral density is hampered by the limited geographic scope of previous studies. Our objectives in this study were to: (1) explore the spatial and temporal patterns of juvenile (1- < 5cm in diameter) colony density across the U.S.-affiliated Pacific islands and atolls; and (2) identify the potential role of ecological and environmental factors which may influence coral juvenile abundance. Juvenile density was quantified as part of NOAA's National Coral Reef Monitoring Program between 2013 and 2019 using a stratified sampling design across 1,405 forereef sites on 34 islands and atolls. Regional mean juvenile density varied from 1.4 to 10.5 colonies m(-2) with the highest densities observed in the northern Mariana Islands, Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, and southern Mariana Islands. Juvenile density significantly increased between sampling periods in the Main Hawaiian Islands, Line Islands and northern Mariana Islands. Survey-weighted generalized linear modeling demonstrated that juvenile density was best predicted by the interaction between time since a heat stress event and heat stress severity, depth, site and sector-level percent coral cover, human density, percent unconsolidated substrate, macroalgal cover, herbivore biomass, and the interaction of sector coral cover area and heat stress, and the interaction of wave power (combination of wave height and period) and heat stress. With the unique scale and gradients across the U.S. Pacific, our study found that the high latitude regions have enhanced juvenile density compared to their lower latitude counterparts. Our results also suggest density is most dependent on the timing and severity of heat stress, depth, stock-recruitment with an open adult population, availability of suitable habitat at the site-scale, and the number of humans in the system.

AB  - Terrestrial invertebrates are highly important for the decomposition of dung from large mammals. Mammal dung has been present in many of Earth's ecosystems for millions of years, enabling the evolution of a broad diversity of dung-associated invertebrates that process various components of the dung. Today, large herbivorous mammals are increasingly introduced to ecosystems with the aim of restoring the ecological functions formerly provided by their extinct counterparts. However, we still know little about the ecosystem functions and nutrient flows in these rewilded ecosystems, including the dynamics of dung decomposition. In fact, the succession of insect communities in dung is an area of limited research attention also outside a rewilding context. In this study, we use environmental DNA metabarcoding of dung from rewilded Galloway cattle in an experimental set-up to investigate invertebrate communities and functional dynamics over a time span of 53 days, starting from the time of deposition. We find a strong signal of successional change in community composition, including for the species that are directly dependent on dung as a resource. While several of these species were detected consistently across the sampling period, others appeared confined to either early or late successional stages. We believe that this is indicative of evolutionary adaptation to a highly dynamic resource, with species showing niche partitioning on a temporal scale. However, our results show consistently high species diversity within the functional groups that are directly dependent on dung. Our findings of such redundancy suggest functional stability of the dung-associated invertebrate community, with several species ready to fill vacant niches if other species disappear. Importantly, this might also buffer the ecosystem functions related to dung decomposition against environmental change. Interestingly, alpha diversity peaked after approximately 20-25 days in both meadow and pasture habitats, and did not decrease substantially during the experimental period, probably due to preservation of eDNA in the dung after the disappearance of visiting invertebrates, and from detection of tissue remains and cryptic life stages.

AB  - Mediterranean-climate oak woodlands, including those in North America and in the Mediterranean basin, are human-shaped ecosystems with high biodiversity value, which generate different ecosystem services, including grazing resources for livestock production. Low oak recruitment rates, however, are affecting the ecological sustainability of these ecosystems. Understanding the factors affecting recruitment dynamics in Mediterranean oak woodlands is crucial for adequately managing these ecosystems. We used a meta-analysis approach to evaluate the direct effects of ungulates on Mediterranean oak woodlands at various stages of recruitment, analysing publications based on ungulate exclusion experiments. The rela-tionship between ungulates and recruitment is complex, involving multiple interacting factors, but, with very few exceptions, studies reported substantial negative direct impacts. Our meta-analyses show that the odds of an acorn surviving are much lower when ungulates are present and that the impact of wild ungulates on acorn survival was more marked than that of domestic animals. Ungulates also reduce the recruitment rates of oak seedlings and saplings as well as their growth rates. Ungulate management is crucial to achieve adequate oak recruitment in Mediterranean oak woodlands. We suggest management practices that may contribute to reduce the effects of ungulates in oak recruitment and to ecologically sustainable Mediterranean oak woodlands.

AB  - Introduction Coral bleaching immediately impacts the reef benthos, but effects on fish communities are less well understood because they are often delayed and confounded by anthropogenic interactions.Methods We assessed changes in fish abundance, biomass and community composition before and after the 2015/16 coral bleaching event at Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles, where local human impacts are minimal, but reefs suffered 50% bleaching-induced coral mortality. We monitored 12 shallow (2-5 m water depth) and nine deep (15 m water depth) permanent survey sites using two survey methods: indicator surveys recording 84 taxa over six years (pre-: 2014; post-bleaching: 2016-2019, 2021), sizing fish based on six size-class categories, and extended fish surveys recording 198 taxa over two years (pre-: 2015; post-bleaching: 2020) with size estimates to the nearest cm (excluding fish < 8 cm).Results During indicator surveys, mean fish abundance did not change on deep reefs. However, abundance increased by 77% on shallow reefs between 2014 and 2016, which was mainly driven by increases in herbivores and omnivores, likely as a response to elevated turf algae cover following coral mortality. Overall (and functional group-specific) indicator fish biomass did not differ between 2014 and 2016 and remained at or above pre-bleaching levels throughout 2016-2021. In contrast, extended fish surveys in 2015 and 2020 showed a 55-60% reduction in overall abundance on shallow and deep reefs, and a 69% reduction in biomass on shallow reefs, with decreases in biomass occurring in all functional groups. Biomass on deep reefs did not differ between 2015 and 2020. Multivariate analysis of both data sets revealed immediate and long-lasting differences between pre- and post-bleaching fish community compositions, driven largely by herbivorous, omnivorous and piscivorous taxa.Discussion Results from the indicator surveys suggest that the bleaching event had limited impact on fish abundance and biomass, while the extended surveys recorded changes in abundance and biomass which would otherwise have gone undetected. Our findings improve understanding of the shift a broad community of fish undergoes following a mass coral bleaching event and highlights the value of survey methods that include the full suite of species to detect ecological responses to environmental drivers.

AB  - Grasslands cover one-third of the terrestrial area, though half of them have been degraded and primarily due to overgrazing. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is home to the largest area of alpine grassland on Earth, experiencing a typical degradation-restoration story over the past three decades. With the large-scale implementation and longterm duration of ecological projects aimed at restoring degraded grasslands by fencing across the TP, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the direction and magnitude of changes in the carbon (C) sink function. To address this, we combined ten pairs of systematic field observations at the site scale with literature compilation, aiming to clarify whether restoration still contributes to C uptake and its driving factors. Our results show that after a decade of restoration, living biomass was enhanced by over 80 %, and litter accumulation increased by 3.68 +/- 1.25 times across all ecosystem types, although these changes were barely reflected in soil C. Litter caused consistent negative impacts on CO2 uptake across all vegetation types, despite restoration having increased CO2 uptake by half in alpine steppes and alpine meadows. This negative impact was more evident in alpine wetlands, where the quantity of litter was double the living biomass. The thick layer of litter produced a shading effect that further limited the photosynthetic yield of living plants, regulating the restoration-induced CO2 gain or loss. Combining 246 cases across the TP further highlights the need to shorten the duration of restoration to maximize CO2 uptake while also benefitting sustainability, which is deserving of attention from both the scientific community and policy-makers.

AB  - We revisit the nature and extent of trophic cascades and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) recovery in the northern range of Yellowstone National Park, where studies have reported on Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus canadensis) browsing and young aspen heights following the 1995-96 reintroduction of gray wolves (Canis lupus). A recent study by Brice et al. (2021) expressed concerns about methodologies employed in earlier aspen studies and that results from those studies exaggerated the extent to which a trophic cascade has benefitted aspen, concerns such as: (a) the selection of aspen stands, (b) young aspen sampling and measurements within stands, (c) the upper browse level of elk, (d) cause of increased young aspen height growth, (e) interpretation of browsing and height data, and others. We individually address these concerns and conclude that earlier aspen studies have provided important insights regarding the recovery of aspen that is underway in northern Yellowstone and that they have not exaggerated the ongoing recovery. We found that Brice et al. (2021) misinterpreted or misrepresented various aspects of those earlier studies, while failing to address potential biases and shortcomings of their own 2007-2017 study, including; sampling aspen stands from only a portion of the park's northern range, not randomly selecting aspen stands across their study area, but only within identified treatments, varying sampling density (stands/km(2)) by more than an order of magnitude between treatments, and not sampling all stands in most years. Regardless of the research methodologies employed in various aspen studies, they have consistently shown that decreased browsing has resulted in greater young plant heights in the park's northern range, results consistent with an ongoing trophic cascade.

AB  - Plant secondary chemistry is known to be an important driver of plant-insect community structure across ecological scales. Recently, the concept of phytochemical diversity (PD) has been introduced to help describe variation in plant secondary chemistry and explain how this variation affects community structure. Previous studies show that PD among individuals and species results in phytochemical mosaics, known as the phytochemical landscape. However, plant traits can vary at finer scales, such as within individuals, and even a single host plant may be perceived as an entire phytochemical landscape by an interacting insect.
   Using the neotropical shrub Piper amalago, we tested and compared how herbivory, caterpillar biodiversity and plant-herbivore network structure are affected by the compositional (number and concentration of compounds) and structural (diversity of distinct chemical structures) dimensions of PD. We analysed variation among individual plants and among-plant height strata within individual plants. This allowed us to decompose PD within and among plant individuals and analyse how variation at both scales affects the plant-herbivore network.
   We found that both within and among plants greater structural diversity decreased herbivore feeding damage. Furthermore, each dimension of PD has different effects on herbivore biodiversity and network structure depending on the scale of biological organization.
   Within plants, the compositional dimension, specifically low concentrations of compounds tentatively identified as Piper amides, increased herbivore biodiversity. This dimension also increased the capacity of strata within plants to mediate ecological cascades through direct and indirect effects on herbivore abundance in the plant-herbivore network. In contrast, a greater structural diversity among plants decreased herbivore biodiversity and the capacity of plants to affect all other herbivores and plants directly and indirectly in the network.
   Synthesis. Based on our results we expand the concept of the phytochemical landscape to multiple scales of biological organization and provide evidence that PD may be maintained by how its multiple dimensions have distinct roles across scales of biological organization.

AB  - Context. Scent-trailing dogs ("hounds') are used to hunt introduced sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) in south-eastern Australia, but little is known about this recreational hunting technique. Aim. The aim of this study was to characterise hound hunting of sambar deer in Victoria, Australia. Our study had three objectives as follows: (1) to report the hunting success of the technique; (2) to estimate pursuit times and distances; and (3) to investigate the landscape features associated with kill sites. Methods. Data were collected from four hound-hunting crews during 2020-2021. GPS data from collars fitted to hounds were used to quantify hunt duration (min) and hunt distance (m). Logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of deer sex and hound pack size on the probability of hunting success. We used a Bayesian multinomial regression resource selection function (RSF) to identify the characteristics of sites where deer were killed (elevation, aspect, and distances to water and roads). Key results. The four hunting teams ranged in size from 2 to 10 people and from one to eight hounds. Of 136 hunts, most (88%) harvested a deer, with pursued deer escaping on the other 12% of occasions. Pursuit times and distances were highly variable, with pursuit time > 60 min for 46% of hunts and pursuit distance > 5 km for 30% of hunts. The probability of killing a pursued male and female deer were similar, and there was not a positive relationship between pack size and hunt success. The RSF showed that both male and female deer were more likely to be killed on steeper slopes and closer to roads. Conclusions. Successful hound hunting of sambar deer involves pursuits of considerable duration and requires a network of roads, with geographical features associated with deer kills sites being related to hunter access. Implications. Hound hunting may be a useful wildlife management tool for land managers, but further studies are needed to assess its efficacy for achieving management goals.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) are a major threat to global biodiversity. The total cost of biological invasions across all European Union member states has been estimated at 129.9 billion US dollars between 1960 and 2020. It is, therefore, crucial to implement effective measures for IAS management. In Europe, the overarching mechanism for this is established through the European Union (EU) Biodiversity Strategy 2030, which aims to halve the number of Red List species threatened by IAS by 2030, namely by stepping up the implementation of the EU IAS Regulation. To support the implementation of the strategy, we use the Species Threat Abatement and Restoration (STAR) methodology to identify and quantify opportunities to reduce species extinction risk in the EU by managing invasive alien species (IAS), focusing specifically on its threat abatement component (STAR-t). Using data from the European Red List on extinction risk, threats and distribution for terrestrial and freshwater species groups (both animals and plants) threatened by IAS, we identified key geographic areas and species for intervention. The countries and territories providing the largest opportunities to contribute towards reducing EU species extinction risk through managing IAS are the Canary Islands [Spain] (20.8% of total EU STAR-t attributed to IAS), Madeira [Portugal] (14.2%), mainland Spain (11.9%), Italy (9.3%), Azores [Portugal] (5.4%) and Greece (5.3%). For specific IAS, the greatest opportunities to reduce regional species extinction risk by mitigating threats from IAS come from managing feral goats (12.4%), mouflons (8.1%), rabbits (5.3%) and rats (4.6%). This work showcases the first application of STAR at a regional scale to measure opportunities for threat abatement caused by IAS and provides practical application in guiding the management actions with the highest conservation gains towards the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030.

AB  - Many mammals cross large rivers to access seasonal habitats, yet river crossing behavior is poorly acknowledged or understood. Crossing large rivers is inherently risky, with vessel traffic and flooding events increasing the risk of drowning. We investigated river crossing behavior by threatened bison (Bison bison) in the boreal forest, using data from 11 GPS-collared animals to identify when and where they cross a major river. We used kernel densities of GPS locations to identify crossing hotspots, and developed resource selection function (RSF) models that used habitat characteristics to explain crossing behavior based on a priori hypotheses. We then predicted high-probability crossing areas along a 400-km stretch of river using the best-supported RSF model. Bison regularly crossed the river ((x) over bar = 8.6 crossings/100 days), particularly during summer months. Model selection results suggested that bison may have chosen river crossing areas that maximized access to forage. Bison preferred to cross the river near islands and areas with high seismic line densities, both of which were likely preferred summer foraging habitats. In addition, islands may have been used as temporary stopovers while crossing the river, or for relief from biting insects. Bison crossed the river where the channel was relatively narrow (x over bar = 400 +/- 213 m [SD]) and chose days when river discharge was low, likely to reduce the risk of drowning, exhaustion, or hypothermia. While based on a small sample of collared bison, predictions about high-probability crossing areas may be used to inform mitigation measures aimed at reducing bison drowning caused by vessel traffic, which is expected to increase as resource development expands in the region. Our approach may be informative for identifying river crossing hotspots for other mammals that cross major rivers.

AB  - ContextAs cities seek to provide more habitat for wildlife, there may be unintended consequences of increasing tick-borne disease hazards. In the United States, the Northeast is both highly urban and a hotspot for blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) and tick-borne disease emergence. Though tick-borne disease was once considered a suburban and rural problem, tick-borne hazards in urban landscapes are increasing.ObjectivesWe hypothesized that multi-scale ecological processes hierarchically contribute to tick-borne hazards across an urbanization gradient. Urban greenspaces with higher functional connectivity to deer movement would have higher deer occupancy at the 'ecological neighborhood' scale, resulting in increased blacklegged tick populations and pathogen infection at the scale of within greenspaces.MethodsTo evaluate our hypothesis, we used circuit theory methods to model the impact of functional connectivity on deer occupancy, blacklegged tick abundance, and pathogen infected ticks across an urbanization gradient. We sampled nymphal ticks during their peak activity and deployed wildlife cameras to detect deer at 38 greenspaces across New York City and Long Island, NY from 2022 to 2023.ResultsWe found that functional connectivity significantly predicted deer occupancy with cascading effects on abundance of blacklegged nymphal ticks and Borrelia burgdorferi infection. We novelly identified a threshold of functional connectivity in urban areas necessary for deer occupancy, tick populations, and tick infection with B. burgdorferi, to emerge in urban environments.ConclusionsWe recommend targeted tick-borne hazard mitigation along this functional connectivity threshold as part of urban greenspace management plans. Additionally, we highlight the importance of examining multi-scale landscape drivers of host, tick, and pathogen interactions.

AB  - Livestock grazing and trampling have been shown to reduce arthropod populations. Among arthropods, defoliating lepidopterans are particularly important for their impact on trees, the keystone structures of agroforestry systems. This study investigates the impact of livestock on the community of defoliating lepidopterans in agroforestry systems. We conducted both experimental and observational studies in the mid-west and western regions of the Iberian Peninsula. In our field experiment, we sampled lepidopteran caterpillars in areas with livestock and in areas where livestock had been excluded for short and long periods. To validate our experimental results, we conducted a field survey across seven areas with and without livestock in the western Iberian Peninsula. Our findings revealed that after 2 years from the start of the experiment, the exclusion of livestock led to an increase in the abundance and species richness of lepidopterans, as well as shifts in their community composition. Our experimental findings were corroborated by our field survey. Interestingly, we found that the differences in community composition among exclusions were primarily due to species nestedness. Livestock exclusion consistently favored species that pupate in the ground, suggesting that livestock can alter the lepidopteran community by predating or accidentally trampling these species. This study underscores the significant role livestock play in modifying the community of defoliating lepidopterans in Mediterranean agroforestry systems (oak savannahs), with important implications for food webs and species interactions.

AB  - Introduction Technological developments have facilitated the collection of large amounts of imagery from isolated deep-sea ecosystems such as abyssal nodule fields. Application of imagery as a monitoring tool in these areas of interest for deep-sea exploitation is extremely valuable. However, in order to collect a comprehensive number of species observations, thousands of images need to be analysed, especially if a high diversity is combined with low abundances such is the case in the abyssal nodule fields. As the visual interpretation of large volumes of imagery and the manual extraction of quantitative information is time-consuming and error-prone, computational detection tools may play a key role to lessen this burden. Yet, there is still no established workflow for efficient marine image analysis using deep learning-based computer vision systems for the task of fauna detection and classification.Methods In this case study, a dataset of 2100 images from the deep-sea polymetallic nodule fields of the eastern Clarion-Clipperton Fracture zone from the SO268 expedition (2019) was selected to investigate the potential of machine learning-assisted marine image annotation workflows. The Machine Learning Assisted Image Annotation method (MAIA), provided by the BIIGLE system, was applied to different set-ups trained with manually annotated fauna data. The results computed with the different set-ups were compared to those obtained by trained marine biologists regarding accuracy (i.e. recall and precision) and time.Results Our results show that MAIA can be applied for a general object (i.e. species) detection with satisfactory accuracy (90.1% recall and 13.4% precision), when considered as one intermediate step in a comprehensive annotation workflow. We also investigated the performance for different volumes of training data, MAIA performance tuned for individual morphological groups and the impact of sediment coverage in the training data.Discussion We conclude that: a) steps must be taken to enable computer vision scientists to access more image data from the CCZ to improve the system's performance and b) computational species detection in combination with a posteriori filtering by marine biologists has a higher efficiency than fully manual analyses.

AB  - The re-introduction paradigm is that Arabian Oryx (Oryx leucoryx) herds adjust the size of their home ranges depending on the availability of vegetation, which is directly related to rainfall. In Israel, Arabian oryx were released in two hyper-arid sites: the Arava Valley and in the Paran wilderness, belonging to the Sudanese and the Saharo-Arabian biogeographic zones, respectively. While post-release survival was similar in both, reproductive success in the Paran wilderness reintroduction site was extremely low, resulting in an acute decline of the reintroduced population over time. The hypothesis that impaired nutrition might be associated with this finding was assessed with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-aided chemistry of monthly sampled fecal pellets, used as remote sensing evidence of ingested diets, throughout a year. Fecal nitrogen (FN), used as an estimate of nutritional status, was consistently higher in the Arava. Grass was never the sole or even a major dietary component. The dietary contribution of tannin-rich browse was high and steady all year-round in the Arava and increased steadily in Paran from winter to summer, corresponding to the period of availability of Acacia raddiana pods in both regions. The oryx in Paran had a home-range that was ten-fold, compared to the Arava, suggesting less feed availability. Acacia browsing may mitigate the effects of temporal variance in primary production. Under such conditions, oryx should be preferably released in areas that support significant acacia stands.

AB  - Large-herbivore grazing has been shown to substantially alter tundra soil and vegetation properties as well as carbon fluxes, yet observational evidence to quantify the impact of herbivore introduction into Arctic permafrost ecosystems remains sparse. In this study we investigated growing-season CO2 and CH4 fluxes with flux chambers on a former wet tussock tundra inside Pleistocene Park, a landscape experiment in northeast Siberia with a 22-year history of grazing. Reference data for an undisturbed system were collected on a nearby ungrazed tussock tundra. Linked to a reduction in soil moisture, topsoil temperatures at the grazed site reacted 1 order of magnitude faster to changes in air temperatures compared to the ungrazed site and were significantly higher, and the difference strongly decreased with depth. Overall, both GPP (gross primary productivity, i.e., CO2 uptake by photosynthesis) and Reco (ecosystem respiration, i.e., CO2 release from the ecosystem) were significantly higher at the grazed site with notable variations across plots at each site. The increases in CO2 component fluxes largely compensated for each other, leaving NEE (net ecosystem exchange) similar across grazed and ungrazed sites for the observation period. Soil moisture and CH4 fluxes at the grazed site decreased over the observation period, while in contrast the constantly waterlogged soils at the ungrazed site kept CH4 fluxes at significantly higher levels. Our results indicate that grazing of large herbivores may promote topsoil warming and drying, in this way effectively accelerating CO2 turnover while decreasing methane emissions in the summer months of peak ecosystem activity. Since we lack quantitative information on the pre-treatment status of the grazed ecosystem, however, these findings need to be considered qualitative trends for the peak growing season, and absolute differences between treatments are subject to elevated uncertainty. Moreover, our experiment did not include autumn and winter fluxes, and thus no inferences can be made for the annual NEE and CH4 budgets in tundra ecosystems.

AB  - Introduced organisms are seen as one of the greatest threats to resource sustainability worldwide, and aquatic macroinvertebrates are regarded as good indicators of the health of water resources. To explore these two perspectives, the responses of macroinvertebrate faunas to native and introduced fishes in three headwater tributaries of the Keiskamma River system, South Africa, were examined by comparing potential indicator communities in reaches considered to be fishless, reaches invaded by introduced salmonid species, and reaches containing native fishes. Patterns in the macroinvertebrate faunal assemblage data were driven strongly by season and flow rate, and less strongly by the presence of insectivorous fishes and biotope availability, a finding in parallel with several similar studies from the region. This affirms that aquatic macroinvertebrate faunas are responsive indicators of both environmental and biotic factors and leaves room for further studies to resolve the effects of non-native fish in the Keiskamma River system and other similar systems from South Africa.

AB  - The critically endangered helmeted hornbill ( Rhinoplax vigil) ) is under threat around its Southeast Asian range due to hunting and habitat loss. Dependant on primary rainforest habitats, the species is thought to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance. Compounding this is the threat of climate change where equatorial ecosystems, such as those found on Borneo, are predicted to increase in temperature and precipitation. It is therefore important to identify whether the species' suitable habitats, both now and in the future, are protected from further anthropogenic disturbance. In this study we used species distribution models to assess the extent of suitable habitat for R. vigil across Borneo, an island which has undergone rapid deforestation in recent years, and a stronghold for the species. Using 302 R. vigil occurrence records, four environmental and three land-use cover variables, we modelled R. vigil current habitat suitability, and two future projections under climate change scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 for 2041-2060. Our results suggest that a quarter of Borneo's landmass is currently suitable for R. vigil. . However, there is a steep decline in the predicted suitable habitat from 335,963 km2 2 (current scenario) to 73,170 km2 2 (future RCP 4.5), to 54,839 km2 2 (future RCP 8.5). Our model predicts that the amount of suitable habitat protected by current protected areas (PAs) and the planned Heart of Borneo (HoB) initiative will increase under future climate change, with the HoB protecting > 65 % of R. vigil suitable habitat across all projections. This is likely worsened by future land-use change not included in these models, which is a limitation to our study. We therefore encourage the connectivity of lowland PAs, and the continuation of HoB targets to prevent further decline of R. vigil habitat around Borneo. This study provides the first species-specific spatial assessment of the critically endangered helmeted hornbill distribution in response to climate change across current and planned protected regions in Borneo.

AB  - Context Wildlife tourism is becoming increasingly popular and often uses bait and berley to attract the target species and enhance customer experience. However, few studies have assessed the effects of food-based attractants on non-target species. Understanding the impacts of provisioning on the marine ecosystem, including non-target species, is required to assess the effects of wildlife tourism comprehensively. Aims We compared fish assemblages at a white shark cage-diving site to those at other offshore islands to assess whether any detectable differences could be observed and attributed to shark diving operations. Methods We used baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) to quantify and compare fish assemblages across a 6-year timespan at the Neptunes Islands Group (South Australia) and six reference locations. The Neptunes Islands Group consist of one high provisioning site, where most (similar to 85%) of the bait and berley input takes place, and one lower provisioning site, where operators visit less frequently. Key results Fish assemblages at the Neptunes Islands Group and all other offshore islands had similar levels of variability. There was a higher total abundance of fish at both Neptune Islands sites than at reference sites, driven by higher abundances of horseshoe leatherjacket, Meuschenia hippocrepis, and barber perch, Caesioperca rasor. However, there were no detectable differences in species richness or evenness between the Neptunes Islands Group and other offshore islands. Conclusions Despite operators using food-based attractant on a near daily basis and some fishes feeding on bait and berley continuously, the cage-diving industry has minimal effects on demersal fish abundance and diversity. Implications This suggests that the current level of provisioning has limited ecological impacts on the reef fish community and highlights that the management regulations are currently suitable for non-target fish assemblages.

AB  - Ecosystems are substantially changing in response to ongoing climate change. For example, coral reefs have declined in coral dominance, with some reefs undergoing regime shifts to non-coral states. However, reef responses may vary through multiple heat stress events, with the rarity of long-term ecological datasets rendering such understanding uncertain. Assessing coral reefs across the inner Seychelles islands using a 28-year dataset, we document faster coral recovery from the 2016 than the 1998 marine heatwave event. Further, compositions of benthic and fish communities were more resistant to change following the more recent heat stress, having stabilized in a persistent altered state, with greater herbivory, following the 1998 climate disturbance. Counter to predictions, a macroalgal-dominated reef that had regime-shifted following the 1998 disturbance is transitioning to a coral-dominated state following the 2016 heat stress. Collectively, these patterns indicate that reef systems may be more resilient to repeat heatwave events than anticipated.

AB  - Aim Ecological theory predicts lower herbivory on islands. However, most island-mainland comparisons have focused on vegetative tissues, while reproductive structures remain understudied despite their direct influence on plant fitness and recruitment. This study investigates how insularity affects insect herbivory in oak (Quercus) acorns across multiple island-mainland regions and explores the role of acorn traits (chemical defences and nutrients) and climate as potential drivers.Location Three island-mainland regions in Europe: Lesbos Island-mainland Greece, the Balearic Islands-mainland Spain, and Bornholm Island-mainland Sweden.Time Period Acorns were collected in autumn 2023. Climatic data are long-term averages for each population.Major Taxa Studied Seven oak (Quercus) species across regions.Methods We aimed to sample up to three island and three mainland populations per species, with four trees per population, but logistical constraints reduced these numbers, resulting in a total of 150 sampled trees. We assessed acorn damage by insect herbivores and analysed chemical defences (phenolics) and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) to test their influence on island-mainland differences in herbivory. Climatic data from the WorldClim database were used to assess climate-mediated insularity effects on acorn traits and herbivory.Results Acorn damage did not differ overall between mainland and island populations. However, in the Balearic Islands, damage was higher than in mainland Spain, while no significant differences were found in the other regions. There were no general insularity effects on acorn traits, but a region-by-insularity interaction influenced phosphorus levels, with higher values in mainland Sweden than Bornholm Island, while the reverse was observed in Greece. Climate influenced acorn traits, but trait differences did not explain herbivory patterns.Main Conclusions Our findings challenge the expectation that insularity reduces herbivory, highlighting region-specific processes. While climate influenced acorn traits, these traits did not mediate insularity effects on herbivory, suggesting local ecological factors drive variation across regions.

AB  - Fluctuations in the abundance of insect herbivores and the severity of damage they cause to their hosts are key factors affecting tree health and trophic interactions. Bell miner associated dieback (BMAD) is a trophic cascade involving eucalypt trees, psyllids and bell miners. Bell miners are a territorial species of bird that reduce insectivorous bird diversity, thereby increasing psyllid abundances. The role of psyllids in BMAD is debated, primarily because psyllid host specificity, genus, defoliation potential and/or lerp composition have been conflated or unexplored. This study documented psyllid communities and canopy structure of four eucalypt hosts (Eucalyptus bridgesiana, E. caliginosa, E. propinqua and E. siderophloia) in BMAD and non-BMAD-affected forests in northern New South Wales. Psyllid abundances were significantly higher in BMAD-affected forests. However, psyllid assemblages did not differ between forest types which contrasts with an influential hypothesis concerning bell miner farming of psyllids that produce sugary lerps (Glycaspis species). Importantly, psyllid communities differed among species of eucalypt host. Hosts supporting higher abundances of Cardiaspina tended to have a stronger negative relationship between canopy health and psyllid abundances than other host trees. Cardiaspina were also found on older leaves and associated with more leaf damage than other psyllids. Unlike most other psyllid genera, Cardiaspina initiate premature foliar senescence leading to defoliation which ultimately changes the age structure of leaves of the canopies of affected trees. Our study supports the functional linkage between psyllid assemblages, their relative abundances and defoliation potential to bottom-up mechanisms behind a bird-associated trophic cascade.

AB  - Recent ecological research suggests that, in general, mixtures are more resistant to insect herbivores and pathogens than monocultures. However, we know little about mixtures with non-native trees, where enemy release could lead to patterns that differ from commonly observed relationships among native species. This becomes particularly relevant when considering that adaptation strategies to climate change increasingly promote a larger share of non-native tree species, such as North American Douglas fir in Central Europe. We studied leaf damage on European beech (Fagus sylvatica) saplings and mature trees across a wide range of site conditions in monocultures and mixtures with phylogenetically distant conifers native Norway spruce (Picea abies) and non-native Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). We analyzed leaf herbivory and pathogen damage in relation to tree diversity and composition effects, as well as effects of environmental factors and plant characteristics. We observed lower sapling herbivory and tree sucking damage on beech in non-native Douglas fir mixtures than in beech monocultures, probably due to a lower herbivore diversity on Douglas fir trees, and higher pathogen damage on beech saplings in Norway spruce than Douglas fir mixtures, possibly because of higher canopy openness. Our findings suggest that for low diversity gradients, tree diversity effects on leaf damage can strongly depend on tree species composition, in addition to modifications caused by feeding guild and tree ontogeny. Moreover, we found that nutrient capacity modulated the effects of tree diversity, composition, and environmental factors, with different responses in sites with low or high nutrient capacity. The existence of contrasting diversity effects based on tree species composition provides important information on our understanding of the relationships between tree diversity and plant-herbivore interactions in light of non-native tree species introductions. Especially with recent Norway spruce die-off, the planting of Douglas fir as replacement is likely to strongly increase in Central Europe. Our findings suggest that mixtures with Douglas fir could benefit the survival or growth rates of beech saplings and mature trees due to lower leaf damage, emphasizing the need to clearly identify and compare the potential benefits and ecological trade-offs of non-native tree species in forest management under ongoing environmental change.

AB  - Invasive predators, land clearing and altered fire regimes have been implicated in species decline and extinction worldwide. Enhanced knowledge of how these factors interact and influence medium-sized mammals is warranted. We tested three hypotheses using occupancy data for a diverse mammal assemblage including three threatened species, five common species, two introduced mesopredators and an apex predator in eastern Australia. We hypothesised that occupancy of mammal species within the assemblage would be influenced by (i) the physical environment (rainfall, vegetation type and elevation), (ii) habitat disturbance (number of fires and habitat fragmentation) and (iii) mesopredator release, whereby occupancy and/or detection of medium-sized mammals are influenced by mesopredators, the feral cat (Felis catus) and the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), which are influenced by an apex predator, the dingo (Canis familiaris). We utilised camera-trapping data from 173 sites (692 camera locations) across a north-south gradient spanning similar to 1500 km in eastern Australia. Although hypotheses i (physical environment) and ii (habitat disturbance) are not mutually exclusive, we show that the variables considered in each were only weakly correlated. We conducted occupancy modelling to investigate the physical environment and habitat disturbance hypotheses. We conducted co-occurrence modelling to investigate interactions between species. The physical environment hypothesis best supported occupancy models for six mammal species: red-necked pademelon (Thylogale thetis), bandicoots (Isoodon macrourus and Perameles nasuta), swamp wallaby (Wallabies bicolor), rednecked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus), eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) and feral cat. The disturbance hypothesis best supported occupancy models for four mammal species: long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus), red-necked pademelon and both mesopredators. Support for the mesopredator release hypothesis was equivocal. Large macropods showed site avoidance towards the red fox. Four species showed higher detection at sites where mesopredators were not detected. The fox showed a negative detection interaction to the dingo and the cat did not. Our study highlights how factors such as rainfall, land clearing, elevation and number of fires influence the occupancy of species within a diverse mammal assemblage at the macroecological scale. Our findings have implications for the conservation of threatened species in managed landscapes and suggestions for further research following the recent 2019-2020 wildfires.

AB  - Although wolves are wide-ranging generalist carnivores throughout their life cycle, during the pup-rearing season wolf activity is focused on natal den sites where pup survival depends upon pack members provisioning food. Because prey availability is influenced by habitat quality within the home range, we investigated the relative importance of prey species for adults and pups and further examined the relationship between habitat characteristics, wolf diet, and litter size on Prince of Wales Island (POW) in Southeast Alaska. During 2012-2020, we detected 13 active den sites within the home ranges of nine wolf packs. We estimated minimum pup counts using motion-detecting cameras and individual genotypes from noninvasive samples (hair: n = 322; scat: n = 227) and quantified wolf diet composition using fecal DNA metabarcoding (n = 538). We assessed habitat composition, configuration, and connectivity within denning and annual home ranges estimated using wolf GPS-collar data. Contrary to expectations, wolves had a more constricted diet during denning season (April 15-July 31), and within this season pups had a narrower dietary niche (species richness [S] = 4) focused more on deer (relative frequency of occurrence [O/I] = 0.924) than adults (S = 15; deer O/I = 0.591). Litter size had a positive relationship with the relative frequency of deer in a wolf pack's diet. Wolf consumption of deer was positively associated with the proportion of young-growth forest (& LE;25 years old) within denning and annual home ranges. High levels of vegetation patch interspersion, and the density of closed logging roads were also important predictors, suggesting these habitat qualities were influential for increasing the availability of deer to wolves. Our results contrast with previous research indicating wolf pup diets included more alternate prey (i.e., beaver) than adults and emphasize the importance of deer to wolf viability on POW, especially during denning season.

AB  - 1. Despite increasing evidence that herbivore-mediated indirect effects play a major role in plant competition, it is unclear how and when they contribute to plant invasiveness. The outcomes of herbivore-mediated indirect effects are primarily dependent on the environment and have complex interactions with the direct interactions between plants.
   2. We evaluated the herbivore-mediated indirect effects of Solidago altissima (Asteraceae) on other co-occurring native Asteraceae species at multiple sites in a native range [the United States (US)] and in an introduced range (Japan) using common garden experiments. We examined the effect of S. altissima on herbivore damage, above-ground vegetative and reproductive traits of the co-occurring Asteraceae species at sites with different densities of a herbivore, the lace bug, Corythucha marmorata, which is native to the US and introduced in Japan.
   3. We observed increased lace bug herbivory in plants grown with S. altissima in Japan but decreased lace bug herbivory in the US. We did not find consistent effect of S. altissima on aboveground vegetative production of co-occurring plants in either ranges. Flower production decreased in plants grown with S. altissima in Japan because of both direct competition and increased herbivory. Direct competition and apparent competition via lace bug herbivory interacted to produce a strong negative effect of S. altissima on co-occurring plants only in Japan.
   4. Synthesis. The findings imply that evolutionary history and the local environment jointly affect herbivore-mediated indirect effects, which play a large role in shaping the pattern of herbivory and plant competition. Another implication of our results is that exotic herbivores may reinforce the negative effects of exotic plants on native plants under high herbivore density environments.

AB  - Kelps are ecosystem engineers, which collectively form forests that provide a variety of important ecosystem services for humans and other organisms. Kelp forests are threatened by multiple local and global stressors, one of the most notable is herbivory. Overabundant sea; urchins can consume kelp, leading to a phase shift from productive forests to unproductive; rocky barrens. Reducing sea urchin densities by directly removing them can reverse this; phase shift. However, maintaining low densities of sea urchins, is logistically and financially; challenging. Following a review of herbivore exclusion methods to date, we tested the efficacy of three different methods for excluding sea urchins from kelp in the laboratory: flexible fences; electricity; and copper anti-fouling paint. The results from the laboratory; experiment showed that flexible fencing was the most successful method for excluding sea urchins. To test the efficacy of this method in the field, sea urchins were removed from 1m(2) patches in barrens and intact kelp beds, and the effectiveness of flexible fences of two different heights (30 cm and 60 cm) at excluding sea urchins were tested. The results from the field study demonstrated that flexible fences of both heights were effective at maintaining low sea urchin densities in barrens but not in intact kelp beds, relative to unmanipulated; rocky barrens. These findings suggest that flexible fencing could be an important tool in restoring kelp in barrens, however the costs of fencing are likely to place limits on the scale at which this management strategy can be implemented.

AB  - 1. One of the major concerns of ecological and evolutionary research is the prediction of community function in relation to the degree of biodiversity. To clarify the relationship between biodiversity and the expression of plant defence traits, we investigated ant-plant defensive mutualism in the pioneer plant Mallotus japonicus at several sites across Japan. The plant bears ant-attracting extrafloral nectar (EFN) and food bodies (FBs) as indirect defence traits.
   2. To reveal variations in ant-plant interactions in the field, we measured species richness of nectar-feeding ants and interaction strength between each ant species and the plant (visiting frequency of each ant species to the plant). We also investigated the expression of EFNs and FBs in natural plant populations at the study sites. To assess the defensive quality of each ant species, we then experimentally estimated the aggressiveness of the dominant ant species. To examine the link between ant species richness and the defensive function of ants, we conducted an ant-exclusion experiment and a common garden experiment to clarify whether the defence efficacy of ants varied in relation to ant species richness.
   3. Ant species richness differed among the study sites. We found negative relationships between ant species richness and the mean interaction strength of ant species, the interaction strength of aggressive ant species and the number of EFNs per leaf. The effectiveness of indirect defence by ants was poor at sites where ant species richness was high. When cultivated in the same environment, plants from sites with low ant species richness developed a larger number of EFNs per leaf than those from sites with high ant species richness.
   4. Our results suggest that facultative ant-plant defensive mutualism is weakened at sites where ant species richness is high, resulting in a decrease in the number of EFNs per leaf. Such a link between species richness and an indirect trait function may help us to understand the evolutionary patterns of various species traits in complex biological communities.

AB  - Translocations have become an essential tool in animal conservation for establishing and maintaining viable populations. Yet, the viability of a population is implicitly based on the individual fitness, that is on the survival and reproduction of individuals. Individual-based assessments of post-translocation fitness are challenging in the wild while conservation breeding programs may provide vital insights. Long-term breeding records of semi-captive (fenced) small population of the Western Derby eland (Taurotragus derbianus derbianus) running in two fenced reserves in Senegal present a case study. This study shows that transport distance and the individual's age at translocation influence animal post-translocation survival rates and individual reproductive performance. The most critical period for the antelope's post-translocation survival was the first 2 years following the event, with higher mortalities reported after long-distance transport in an ecologically novel environment. The first successful calving of translocated females was postponed by 1 year, but the life-long reproductive performance was not affected. However, higher calf survival in a habitat similar to that in the wild suggests a non-negligible effect of the habitat on individual fitness, thus crucial to conservation decisions on translocating threatened species.

AB  - The flora of the Canary Islands has been subject to botanical studies for more than 200 years. Several biodiversity databases are available for the archipelago. However, there are various drivers of change in real biodiversity and the knowledge about it constantly needs to be kept track of. Island floras are both: exposed to species loss and to species introductions, either through natural processes or by anthropogenic drivers. Additionally, the evolution of endemic plant species plays a substantial role. Endemic species are sensitive to population decline due to small population sizes and possible low competitiveness against incoming species. Additionally, there is continuous progress in systematics and taxonomy. Species names or their taxonomic attribution can be modified. Here, we check published plant lists for the Canary Islands and literature, and compile currently accepted taxa into an updated checklist. For this FloCan checklist, several sources were compiled, checked for completeness and quality, and their taxonomy was updated. We illustrate how far plant names are considered in regional or global databases. This work represents the current state of knowledge on Canary Island plant diversity, including introduced and recently described taxa. We provide a comprehensive and updated basis for biogeographical and macroecological studies. Particularly, the number of non-native species is being extended substantially. The adaptation to standard international nomenclature supports integration into large-scale studies.

AB  - The Stipa breviflora desert steppe is an important component of the Eurasian steppe, and its ecosystem functions are directly affected by changes in the individual functional traits of S. breviflora. Based on 14 years of data from the grazing experiment in S. breviflora desert steppe, we investigated changes in the individual tillering traits of S. breviflora in response to four levels (none, light, moderate, heavy) of long-term grazing. The results showed that: (i) long-term grazing resulted in a greater decrease in species richness and increased biomass contribution of S. breviflora in the communities; (ii) long-term grazing resulted in significant differences in aboveground/belowground plant tillering functional traits and their relationships under different grazing intensities; (iii) the leaf biomass of S. breviflora tillering individuals was strongly dependent on leaf number, while the change in root biomass was strongly dependent on the total root length, specific root length, root furcation number, and root crossing number. The response of S. breviflora biomass to grazing intensity and its relation to tillering individual traits revealed that long-term grazing leads to vast tillering in S. breviflora tussock and significant changes in S. breviflora tillering traits, which will have a profound influence on the function of the desert grassland ecosystem.

AB  - Holistically managed urban greenspaces have human and ecological benefits. Butterflies and skippers (Papilionoidea) are particularly sensitive to human impacts and changing environmental conditions and can serve as model organisms for park management. We monitored butterflies across 18 urban parks in Cincinnati, Ohio, to explore the relationship between the amount of forested and non-forested microhabitat and Papilionoidea biodiversity. Transect counts were used to assess Papilionoidea occurrence throughout the summer of 2021. Species richness was found to significantly increase with the amount of non-forested area, while no relationships were found between forested species richness and area or total species richness and total park area. In addition to providing suggestions for urban park microhabitat management, this study updates the species checklist for Hamilton County, Ohio, adding four species. Forty-three species and 433 individuals were sighted during the study. Three species found in Cincinnati Parks were under Ohio Department of Natural Resources conservation status.

AB  - Understanding landscape scale connectivity is an essential component in the management of invasive species since connectivity facilitates their invasion potential. Invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are among the most prolific invaders on the planet, causing billions of dollars in agricultural and environmental damage annually. Newly introduced to Canada in the 1980s, we examined wild pig invasion potential across the northern prairies from western Canada into the currently wild pig-free northern U.S. states. We used GPS collar data collected in the Canadian prairies to quantify resource selection and incorporated results into an electric circuit theory framework to evaluate potential regional landscape connectivity. While available landcover types in this region were dominated by crops and grasslands, wild pigs were predominately located in deciduous forest, crops, and wetlands. Resource selection modelling indicated wild pigs selected deciduous forest and wetlands over other landcover types. These selection tendencies resulted in areas at greater risk of occupation in an intermixture dominated by crops interspersed with waterbodies and deciduous forest fragments, which facilitated movement. Given the pervasiveness of this intermixture across the northern prairies, there was a high potential for invasive wild pigs to move throughout much of the region with areas in southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba, northeastern Montana, North and South Dakota, and western portions of Minnesota being particularly vulnerable. Our work highlights a need for monitoring and science-based response strategies for likely southward spread of this invasive species to prevent or reduce potential crop damage, risks to native species, and disease transmission to humans, pets, livestock, and wildlife.

AB  - Top carnivores are essential for maintaining ecosystem stability and biodiversity. Yet, carnivores are declining globally and current in situ threat mitigations cannot halt population declines. As such, translocations of carnivores to historic sites or those outside the species' native range are becoming increasingly common. As carnivores are likely to impact herbivore and small predator populations, understanding how carnivores interact within an ecosystem following translocation is necessary to inform potential remedial management and future translocations. Dietary analyses provide a preliminary assessment of the direct influence of translocated carnivores on a recipient ecosystem. We used a metabarcoding approach to quantify the diet of Tasmanian devils introduced to Maria Island, Tasmania, a site outside the species' native range. We extracted DNA from 96 scats and used a universal primer set targeting the vertebrate 12S rRNA gene to identify diet items. Tasmanian devils on Maria Island had an eclectic diet, with 63 consumed taxa identified. Cat DNA was detected in 14% of scats, providing the first instance of cats appearing as part of Tasmanian devil diets either via predation or scavenging. Short-tail shearwaters and little penguins were commonly consumed, corresponding with previous surveys showing sharp population declines in these species since the introduction of Tasmanian devils. Our results indicate that the introduction of carnivores to novel ecosystems can be very successful for the focal species, but that commonly consumed species should be closely monitored to identify any vulnerable species in need of remedial management.

AB  - Introduction This study evaluates the effectiveness of soil reconstruction and restoration in the Jiangcang coal mining area on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where harsh environmental conditions pose significant challenges to ecological restoration.Methods Two phases of ecological restoration were implemented, with outcomes assessed based on vegetation coverage, species diversity, biomass, soil properties, and community similarity.Results The results demonstrate that soil reconstruction significantly improved soil fertility, vegetation coverage, and community stability without noticeable degradation over time. The use of sheep manure increased species diversity by introducing native seeds, addressing the shortage of suitable grass species in alpine areas. Comparatively, the second phase of restoration, which included soil reconstruction, has elevated the vegetation coverage to 80%, matching natural background levels, and has also demonstrated superior outcomes in terms of soil stability, nutrient content, and other aspects compared to traditional methods. While aboveground biomass showed rapid recovery, belowground biomass lagged, indicating a need for longer-term restoration. Restored slopes exhibited higher similarity to natural alpine meadows compared to platforms, suggesting the dominance of the artificially seeded species on the platform areas hinders the reproduction of other species, which is unfavorable for the evolution of vegetation diversity.Discussion This study emphasizes the effectiveness of soil reconstruction, organic amendment, and other restoration measures, providing important experience and reference for mine ecological restoration in similar high-altitude mining areas.

AB  - Micropropagation of epiphytic bromeliads associated to translocation may act as an important tool for conservation, restauration or mitigation initiatives. Vriesea incurvata is an epiphytic tank-forming bromeliad endemic to the Atlantic Forest, being an important species in gallery forest environments. Seeds of V. incurvata were germinated in vitro , and plants were acclimatized and translocated to each of two microhabitats (gallery forest and forest interior) of an Atlantic Forest fragment in South Brazil that harbors few individuals of the species. The 152 plants (76 per microhabitat) were monitored for survival and development, and abiotic data were recorded. There was increased development of morphometric parameters of the plants in the gallery forest, and survival rate ensured an 800% increase in the original population of V. incurvata in the study area. Plant survival and development parameters were positively related to light and relative air humidity. In gallery forest, plants flowered and set fruit, indicating their relationship with pollinators, since V. incurvata provides food for fauna. Further, the establishment of the individuals increased the availability of water in the canopy by accumulation in the rosettes, as well as the complexity of the canopy structure, providing a site for the occurrence of detritivorous, predatory and herbivorous arthropods. Thus, based on the method applied to V. incurvata , inserting epiphytic species into forest environments can be an efficient tool for artificial habitat regeneration, incrementing functional diversity and improving environmental quality.

AB  - ContextThe forestry industry provides important goods, services and economic benefits, but timber harvest can adversely impact ecosystem services, including wildlife habitat. Timber harvest planning can integrate wildlife habitat quality through multi-objective optimization for timber harvest and wildlife habitat suitability.ObjectivesOur objective was to develop a method to find optimal solutions for timber harvest and wildlife habitat suitability individually and concurrently, then apply the method to Roosevelt elk (Cervus elaphus roosevelti) on Afognak Island, Alaska.MethodsWe developed three seasonal habitat suitability models using elk locations and landscape variables including historical timber harvest on Afognak Island, Alaska. We used threshold-accepting optimization over a 50-year planning horizon to maximize timber harvest yield and habitat suitability in each season, then used multi-objective goal-deviation optimization to simultaneously maximize timber harvest volume and seasonal habitat suitability.ResultsThe optimal solution for timber yield decreased seasonal average habitat suitability by 5.7%. Elk habitat suitability and corresponding optimal solutions varied seasonally; elk generally selected open landcovers and early- to mid-successional timber stands over late-successional and mature stands. Therefore, in the optimal solutions, stands were harvested before they reached maximum volume and few stands were harvested in early planning periods, resulting in a seasonal average loss of 17.5% yield. Multi-objective optimization decreased seasonal average suitability by 3.9% and yield by 1.4% compared to single-objective optimization.ConclusionsOur multi-objective optimization approach that incorporates data-driven habitat suitability models using open-source software can enable managers to achieve desired quantity and quality of wildlife habitat while providing for resource extraction.

AB  - Recovering deer populations are causing conflict across Europe, especially in the vicinity of protected areas where densities are generally higher. Consequently, a variety of management approaches, such as the provision of winter feeding, have been deployed to keep deer from foraging in undesired areas in an attempt to mitigate conflicts. However, as large ungulates play a key role in nutrient recycling and redistribution, management actions that affect their space use and introduce additional nutrients into a system may translate into changes in the biogeochemistry of protected areas. Yet, little is known about the implications of such deer-management strategies on nutrient patterns. Here, we tested the effects of intensive supplementary feeding in combination with winter enclosures on nutrient distribution in a strictly protected area in Central Europe, the Bavarian Forest National Park. We found significant effects of the current management approach on plant nutrients with elevated nutrient concentrations not only within, but, importantly, extending up to several hundred meters around the enclosures/feeding stations. The increased nutrient concentrations could have cascading consequences for soil microbial activity, plant community composition and other herbivores. Our results illustrate that management actions designed to solve a specific problem (mitigating human-wildlife conflict), may alter local landscape chemistry and influence broader ecosystem functions. Ultimately, this may compromise conservation success, highlighting the need to critically evaluate all potential consequences of common management approaches such as supplementary feeding.

AB  - At-grade fauna passages are much less resources demanding to construct compared to wildlife overpasses or underpasses at infrastructure barriers. Because smaller and intermediate-sized roads are much more common than major roads in most landscapes, at-grade passages have a high potential for cost-efficient barrier mitigation for wildlife. However, at-grade passages have besides risk for vehicle collision involvement, a higher disturbance potential, compared to most over- and underpasses, considering foremost its multiuse with vehicle traffic. We tested if the crossing probability in common Scandinavian ungulates; wildboar (Sus scrofa), roedeer (Capreolus capreolus) and fallow deer (Dama dama), was impacted due to different types of crossing structure, while accounting for availability to alternative crossing sites and environmental factors. We found no differences in crossing probability in wild boar (851 visits), roedeer (1,556 visits) and fallow deer (941 visits) when comparing wildlife visits at 4 at-grade fauna passages and the combined result from 8 wildlife-designed over-/underpasses. This indicates that fauna passage at-grade (with average daily traffic volume of 3,000-8,000) can show similar functionality, in terms of comparable proportions of usage out of all visits, compared to wildlife designed overpasses or underpasses. In addition, when separating among over-, underpasses and at-grade passages, we found no differences in crossing probability in roe deer and fallow deer. Wildboar showed no difference in crossing probability between overpass and at-grade passage, but higher crossing probability at underpass than at-grade. This suggests that establishing several wildlife passages at-grade instead of only a few over- or underpasses designed for wildlife at different grade may be an alternative to reduce infrastructure barriers also along fenced intermediate-sized roads.

AB  - Monitoring large marine mammals is challenging due to their low abundances in general, an ability to move over large distances and wide geographical range sizes.
   The distribution of the pygmy (Kogia breviceps) and dwarf (Kogia sima) sperm whales is informed by relatively rare sightings, which does not permit accurate estimates of their distribution ranges. Hence, their conservation status has long remained Data Deficient (DD) in the Red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which prevent appropriate conservation measures.
   Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding uses DNA traces left by organisms in their environments to detect the presence of targeted taxon, and is here proved to be useful to increase our knowledge on the distribution of rare but emblematic megafauna.
   Retrieving eDNA from filtered surface water provides the first detection of the Dwarf sperm whale (Kogia sima) around the remote Malpelo island (Colombia).
   Environmental DNA collected during oceanic missions can generate better knowledge on rare but emblematic animals even in regions that are generally well sampled for other taxa.

AB  - Simple Summary Gut microbiota play a significant role in the diet digestion and health of the host. Many zoos provide research sites for biological scientists to reintroduce animals, especially those facing extinction. Therefore, to prevent the extinction of wild animals, captive wild animals have become one of the ways to protect threatened taxa. Monitoring the structure and function of the gut microbiota of captive animals can help elucidate whether animals have adapted to their artificial environment, which is one of the key issues in wildlife conservation. This study investigated the gut microbiota of blue sheep and red deer at different growth stages and inter-species. The result shows gut microbiota of blue sheep and red deer will change to some extent in different growth stages, but the dominant flora remains stable. In blue sheep and red deer, the gut microbiota differ significantly between species. In addition, several potentially pathogenic microbial communities were identified based on the current findings. The study highlights key gut microbiota across species and ages. Blue sheep and red deer, second-class key protected animals in China, are sympatric species with a high degree of overlap of food resources in the Helan Mountains, China. Previous studies with blue sheep and red deer in nature have shown that their physiology is closely related to their gut microbiota. However, growth stages and changes occurring in these species in captivity are still unknown. Thus, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to explore diversity, composition and function of the gut microbiota in these two animal species. The diversity and structure of the gut microbiota in captive blue sheep and red deer changed at different growth stages, but the dominant microbiota phyla in the gut microbiota remained stable, which was composed of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia. Moreover, gut microbiota diversity in juvenile blue sheep and red deer was low, with the potential for further colonization. Functional predictions showed differences such as red deer transcription being enriched in adults, and blue sheep adults having a higher cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis than juveniles. Microbial changes between blue sheep and red deer at different growth stages and between species mainly depend on the abundance of the microbiota, rather than the increase and absence of the bacterial taxa.

AB  - Macroalgal forests play a key role in shallow temperate rocky reefs worldwide, supporting communities with high productivity and providing several ecosystem services. Sea urchin grazing has been increasingly influencing spatial and temporal variation in algae distributions and it has become the main cause for the loss of these habitats in many coastal areas, causing a phase shift from macroalgae habitats to barren grounds. The low productive barrens often establish as alternative stable states and only a major reduction in sea urchin density can trigger the recovery of macroalgal forests. The present study aims to assess if the 2018 disease outbreak, responsible for a strong reduction in the sea urchin Diadema africanum densities in Madeira Island, was able to trigger a reverse shift from barren grounds into macroalgae-dominated state. By assessing the diversity and abundance of benthic sessile organisms, macroinvertebrates and fishes before, during and after that particular mass mortality event, we evaluate changes in benthic assemblages and relate them to variations in grazer and herbivore densities. Our results revealed a clear shift from barren state to a macroalgae habitat, with barrens characterized by bare substrate, sessile invertebrate and Crustose Coralline Algae (CCA) disappearing after the mortality event. Overall variations in benthic assemblages was best explained by four taxa (among grazers and herbivores species). However, it was the 2018 demise of D. africanum and its density reduction that most contributed to the reverse shift from a long stable barren state to a richer benthic assemblage with higher abundance of macroalgae. Despite this recent increase in macroalgae dominated habitats, their stability and persistence in Madeira Island is fragile, since it was triggered by an unpredictable disease outbreak and depends on how D. africanum populations will recover. With no control mechanisms, local urchin populations can easily reach the tipping point needed to promote a new shift into barren states. New conservation measures and active restoration are likely required to maintain and promote the local stability of macroalgal forests.

AB  - Despite their importance for biodiversity and other ecosystem services, many semi-natural grasslands deteriorate or have even disappeared due to insufficient grazing and neglect. Preservation of grassland habitats depends on a good understanding of sustainable grazing management as well as effective agricultural policy measures that ensure long-term economic sustainability for the farmer. Through meta-evaluation and synthesis of previous investigations and discussion of scientific literature, we aimed to evaluate factors that determine the extent to which cattle and sheep in Sweden graze semi-natural grasslands instead of more productive land and what this means for biodiversity and sustainability. We also aimed to propose which practises and policy measures may be the most cost-effective to promote habitat quality and the sustainable use of grasslands. Results from a nationwide survey of Swedish farmers' attitudes towards agri-environmental payment schemes are discussed in relation to farm characteristics and other factors influencing the use of cattle and sheep for sustainable grazing. This study supports recommendations by environmental economists that payments should be targeted more strongly at the most valuable grasslands, emphasising the need for a more detailed and nuanced framework for classifying grasslands in Europe. A comparison with independent estimates of the area of agricultural land from nation-wide, sample-based monitoring shows that the data from official statistics normally used for nationwide evaluations are partly biased and of insufficient quality, underscoring the need for more sophisticated and precise methods for monitoring both overall trends and detailed environmental effects related to the preservation of semi-natural grasslands.

AB  - Blowflies are often the first to colonize a cadaver, making them valuable forensic indicators for estimating the post-mortem interval (PMI). However, understanding the decomposition process by blowflies in practice presents challenges due to the direct influence of adults and larvae on the process. Environmental factors can either hinder or stimulate colonization by different species, leading to variability across different settings. In this study, we aimed to investigate the variation in the community of adult and immature stages of Calliphoridae blowflies during pig carcass decomposition in an island area of the Amazon rainforest. We identified changes in abundance, richness, and species composition separately for adults and larvae and measured the congruence between larval and adult communities. Our findings revealed that the peak abundance of adults preceded the peak abundance of larvae during carcass decomposition. Eleven species were collected within the first 4 days of decomposition, of which only seven colonized the carcass. Species composition differed between life stages and decomposition phases, with larvae associated with the skeletonization phase and adults with the colliquative phase. The species composition of adults collected from the decomposing carcass corresponded to that of larvae collected 1 day later. This is the first study conducted in an Amazonian island environment in the extreme north of Brazil to document the cadaveric fauna and analyze the congruence between adult and larval communities of blowflies. These insights contribute to forensic entomology understanding and assist forensic professionals, particularly in tropical regions with high rates of unsolved homicides like Brazil.

AB  - There is increasing focus on reforestation, but the efforts still often include limited subsets of species despite evidence that tree diversity promote biodiversity and ecological resilience. In addition to these benefits, greater inclusion of rare native species in reforestation efforts would also help conserve these species in an uncertain future. Here, we investigate the population ecology and dynamics of the only remaining historical population of the shade-adapted under- and mid-story tree European yew Taxus baccata in Denmark to inform its potential usage in reforestation. The species has been widely extirpated from European landscapes, and while much used in horticulture, is hardly used in reforestation, so there is limited experience with its requirements and performance. We collected data on all individuals in 2015 and compared them with results from a previous census in 1999. Furthermore, we used boosted regression trees (BRT) modelling to investigate the ecological drivers of the distributions of its different life stages. Our results show a stable T. baccata population, with much regeneration in areas of more open-canopy conditions that also support high survival between life-stages. The BRT results show that moss-dominated microhabitats under moderately shaded conditions are important for T. baccata seedling establishment, while higher light availability is important for survival from sapling to adult life-stages. For use in reforestation, we recommend providing moderately shaded microhabitats to allow the seedlings and small saplings to escape competition while also acting as protection from herbivores. Through their long-lived nature, low stature and evergreen foliage, T. baccata would increase the structural complexity of young woodlands, likely enhancing their value for biodiversity, their ecological resilience, as well as their amenity value. Inclusion of T. baccata in reforestation efforts would also aid its spontaneous recolonization of woodland areas, helping it to build larger, more widespread populations with greater resilience to future pressures.

AB  - An increasing onus on elasmobranch management by regional bodies has been hindered by a lack of data on abundance, distribution and fisheries, especially in data-poor areas like the eastern Atlantic Ocean. From 2015 through 2017, 204 baited remote underwater videos (BRUV) were deployed in Cabo Verde around the eastern islands of Sal, Boavista and Maio and the remote offshore reef Jo & atilde;o Valente to establish a baseline of elasmobranch abundance. Over 200 hours of footage revealed 215 individual elasmobranchs, spanning 14 species from 6 taxonomic families. The abundance of elasmobranchs was highest in Maio, the island with the smallest human population, followed by Boavista and Sal. Smaller-bodied meso-predatory species such as the common smoothhound (Mustelus mustelus) and the Atlantic weasel shark (Paragaleus pectoralis) constituted the majority of observations in Maio and Boavista. Inversely, Carcharhinus spp. were observed in considerably greater abundance in Sal, and there was notably lower abundance of small-bodied sharks at sites with high large-bodied Carcharhinid abundance. Species richness was consistent with abundance estimates across islands, with Boavista and Sal recording the highest species diversity, followed by Maio. Results suggest that amongst Cabo Verde's eastern islands, there exists a high relative diversity and abundance of coastal elasmobranchs compared to populations in West Africa. Nonetheless, there is evidence of exploitation of higher trophic levels species. This trend is most notable in the decreasing abundance of Carcharhinids with increasing proximity to the capital city Praia, suggesting that fishing efforts from the capital are negatively affecting the abundance of large-bodied, higher-trophic predators.

AB  - The successful establishment of an exotic species is based on its resource-based habitat, and thus depends on its encountering the interaction partners and environmental conditions it requires to complete its life cycle. We examine factors that define the resource-based habitat of the European common blue butterfly (Polyommatus icarus Rottemburg, [1775] (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae)) recently introduced in Quebec, testing the role of exotic host plants and of short vegetation structure. Field studies surveyed adult butterfly abundance in lightly managed urban sites and related it to host plant cover and vegetation structure. Oviposition behavior was also recorded and linked to individual plant traits, namely height, species and anatomical structures. Results show that adult butterflies maintain the same host plant associations as in the native range, suggesting a role for naturalized plants in facilitating the establishment of this exotic herbivore. However, relative oviposition rate was not higher on the most strongly associated host plant (birdsfoot trefoil, Lotus corniculatus, Fabaceae) suggesting no clear behavioral preference for this plant. Butterflies also showed the same association with short vegetation documented in the native range, although the basis for this preference remains unclear. P. icarus uses different biotopes in its invaded range (lightly managed urban sites) than in its native range (unimproved grasslands), and our results show the role of host plants and of short vegetation structure in defining the resource-based habitat that can predict its future expansion. Our results raise interesting questions about why this butterfly uses cities more in its invaded than its native range. The role of cities in insect conservation is increasingly recognized; we show how, paradoxically, a butterfly whose native biotopes are declining has found suitable conditions to thrive in far-removed urban centers.

AB  - Male and female reproductive behaviour is typically synchronised. In species such as those in the family Cervidae, reproductive timing is often cued by photoperiod, although in females, it can be dependent on body condition. When a species is introduced to a novel environment, the environment changes, or responses of the sexes to such cues differ, asynchronous reproductive behaviour between males and females may occur. We investigated the seasonality of reproductive behaviour in introduced chital deer in northern Queensland by examining male antler phase in relation to female conception rates. We then analysed the influence of different variables likely to affect the timing of male and female reproductive physiology. The lowest percentage of chital in hard antler in any 1 month in this study was 35% (Fig. 1), but the average value was closer to 50%, thus there was a seasonal peak in antler phase linked with photoperiod. Females conceived at any time of year, but were strongly influenced by the amount of rainfall 3 months prior to conception. This resulted in varying conception peaks year-to-year that often did not correspond to the male's peak in hard antler. In this system, a proportion of males and females were physiologically and behaviourally ready to mate at any time of the year. We predict that differences in the timing of the peaks between the males and females will lead to increased reproductive skew (variation in reproductive success among individual males). This pattern may select for different mating strategies or physiological mechanisms to increase reproductive success.

AB  - Coral reefs worldwide are exposed to increased levels of thermal stress due to global warming. A coral reef at the remote island of Kapou (Lisianski) in Papaha over bar naumokua over bar kea experienced an unprecedented level of heat stress in 2014, which resulted in coral bleaching and subsequent mass mortality that resulted in nearly 100 % loss of live coral cover. Here, we describe successional changes in benthic communities occurring on the reef from 2014 to 2021 based on our surveys utilizing underwater photogrammetric techniques. Despite having > 85 % Montipora live coral cover before the bleaching event, the newly available substrata created by the loss of coral were quickly colonized by the green macroalga Halimeda, along with an ephemeral bloom of the green macroalga Boodlea in 2016. While Halimeda continued to increase in benthic cover, other algae (Neomeris, Asparagopsis and uniden-tified filamentous red and green algae) also started colonizing the reef between 2017 and 2021. Erosion of the reef substrata was evident in both in-situ and three-dimensional surveys in 2015 following the bleaching event and has continued to progress through time. The high abundance of Halimeda may indicate a slow process of coral recovery, but the overall benthic diversity increased in 2021 due to the presence of other algae and an increase in hard substrata and turf algal cover. New colonies of Montipora coral were also observed during annual surveys following the bleaching-induced mortality. Future monitoring efforts should continue to track coral and algal communities and survey herbivorous fish and reef binders that play important ecological roles in algal control, reef erosion and sediment binding. Such efforts should reveal interactions among these different ecological processes that enable reef succession following mass coral mortality.

AB  - The importance of ocean currents in influencing the connectivity and dispersal of marine megafauna, including sea turtles, is becoming increasingly recognized. However, more comprehensive studies are needed on how these currents impact the genetic makeup and connectivity of green turtle Chelonia mydas (Linnaeus, 1758) populations in the Pacific Islands region. To address this gap, our study conducted genetic analyses of green turtles in foraging grounds from four Micronesian sites and predictive modelling of hatchling dispersal patterns based on ocean currents to explore connectivity between foraging grounds and rookeries across Micronesia. We analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype frequencies from newly collected and published data. We used Bayesian mixed stock analysis (MSA) to estimate the relative proportion of turtles from different Management Units (MUs) within the foraging grounds. Our ocean current simulations predicted hatchling dispersal trajectories, revealing how passive drift may facilitate wide-ranging dispersal and connectivity among distant foraging and nesting sites. Across the four Micronesian foraging grounds, the MSA revealed varying contributions from different rookeries, with some turtles exhibiting rare, long-distance dispersal traits. Our study highlights the intricate relationship between oceanic currents and the spatial dynamics of green turtles across the Pacific. Our findings offer essential insights into the conservation and management of green turtles by highlighting the role of oceanic currents in shaping population connectivity. Future research should focus on expanding genetic analyses and refining ocean drift simulations to enhance our understanding of marine megafauna migration and inform regional conservation strategies effectively.

AB  - Axis deer (Axis axis) are invasive species that threaten native ecosystems and agriculture on Maui Island. To mitigate negative effects, it is necessary to understand current abundance, population trajectory, and how to most effectively reduce the population. Our objectives were to examine the population history of Maui axis deer, estimate observed population growth, and use species-specific demographic parameters in a VORTEX population viability analysis to examine removal scenarios that would most effectively reduce the population. Only nine deer were introduced in 1959, but recent estimates of >10,000 deer suggest population growth rates (r) ranging between 0.147 and 0.160 even though >11,200 have been removed by hunters and resource managers. In VORTEX simulations, we evaluated an initial population size of 6,000 females and 4,000 males, reflecting the probable 3F:2M sex ratio, with annual removal rates of 10%, 20%, and 30% over a 10-year period. A removal rate of 10% resulted in a positive growth rate of 0.103 +/- 0.001. A 20% removal rate resulted in only a slightly negative growth, while a 30% removal rate resulted in -0.130 +/- 0.004. By increasing the ratio of females removed to 4F:1M in the 30% harvest scenario, the decline nearly doubled, resulting in -0.223 +/- 0.004. Effectively reducing axis deer will most likely require an annual removal of approximately 20-30% of the population and with a greater proportion of females to increase the population decline. Selective removal of males may not only be inefficient, but also counterproductive to population reduction goals.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Habitat simplification and use of pesticides in vineyard agro-ecosystems simplified arthropod communities, reducing natural pest control. In this context, habitat management practices could be useful strategies to provide fundamental sources for sustaining natural enemies. The effects of habitat management practices on pests and beneficial arthropods were evaluated in vineyards of North-eastern Italy through different field experiments. We reduced mowing frequency of inter-row spontaneous grasses, compared different timing of mowing of a green manure mixture, and different green manure mixtures. The abundance of key natural enemies (e.g., predatory mites, parasitic wasps and spiders) and some grapevine leafhoppers increased when the grass mowing frequency was reduced. Many beneficial arthropods increased in numbers in organic vineyards. Late mowing of green manure favored spiders and parasitic wasps but not herbivores associated with grapevines. The experiments on the comparison of green manure mixtures did not significantly affect the arthropod communities. Groundcover management practices could enhance beneficial arthropod abundance, but the adoption of this practice should be carefully evaluated when pests occur.
   In this study, the effects of habitat management practices on both pests and beneficial arthropods were evaluated in vineyards of North-eastern Italy through different field experiments: (1) mowing of inter-row spontaneous grasses in conventional and organic vineyards, (2) different timing of mowing of a green manure mixture, and (3) comparing different green manure mixtures. The first experiment followed a split-plot design, while randomized block design was used in the second and third experiment. In each experiment arthropods were sampled using different methods: leaf sampling, beating and sweep net sampling. Non-mowed spontaneous grasses in inter-rows of vineyards favored the abundance of natural enemies (e.g., predatory mites, parasitic wasps and spiders), and sometimes grapevine leafhoppers. Many arthropod species were recorded in higher numbers in organic vineyards. Late mowing of green manure favored beneficial arthropods (e.g., spiders and parasitic wasps), while it did not influence herbivore density. Groundcover management practices, aimed at increasing plant biodiversity in vineyards, could be a useful tool to enhance beneficial arthropod abundance, although the adoption of this practice should be carefully evaluated when pests occur. Semi-natural areas can contribute to create a more pest-stable agro-ecosystem and should be integrated with appropriate ecological infrastructures surrounding vineyards.

AB  - Native and restored forests are increasingly impacted by pests and diseases, including large herbivores. While community- and species-level impacts of these tree enemies are often well-documented, there is little understanding of their influence on finer-scale eco-evolutionary processes. We here study the influence of large-mammal herbivory on the survival and height growth of trees in a mixed species restoration planting of the Australian forest trees, Eucalyptus ovata and E. pauciflora, in Tasmania, Australia. Common-garden field trials mixing the two species were compared in adjacent unbrowsed (fenced) and browsed (unfenced) plantings. The browsed planting was exposed to mammal browsing by native marsupials, as well as feral introduced European fallow deer (Dama dama). Each tree species was represented by open-pollinated families from 22 paired geographic areas, allowing the assessment of the effects of browsing on the species and population differences, as well as on family variation within each species. In the browsed planting, a marked reduction in species and population differences, as well as in family variance, was observed for both height growth and survival. The pattern of height growth and survival of the populations of both species also differed between browsing regimes, with significant changes of climate relationships involving both focal tree attributes detected. Our results argue for a major disruption of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of restored forests in the presence of browsing by large mammalian herbivores, at the observed period of the tree life cycle. Importantly for forest restoration and conservation in the face of global change, our results challenge the choice of tree populations for translocation based solely on predicted or observed relationships of their home-site climate with current and predicted future climates of the restoration sites, while emphasising the need for genetic diversity to provide future resilience of restored forests to both biotic and abiotic stresses.

AB  - Context. Accurate baseline data for wildlife populations are important to track trends of these populations over time and to identify threats to their long-term persistence. Aims. We aimed to assess the status and distribution of the little studied megapode (Megapodius laperouse laperouse) across the Mariana Islands. Methods. Using passive and call playback facilitated surveys in 2008 through 2010, we employed point-transect distance sampling to assess island-level and archipelago-wide status of this megapode. To assess conservation needs, we defined human presence as the current, recent, or intermittent occurrence of humans on islands. Key results. We recorded 657 megapode detections and estimated an archipelago level abundance of 11,542 individuals (95% CI: 5456-17,623) from 699 sampling points across 10 islands. Three islands supported 86% of the megapode population, but cumulatively comprise only 2% of the archipelago's land area. Conclusions. Micronesian Megapodes preferred native forest. Human presence and the availability of native forest may limit their abundance and distribution in the Mariana Islands. Although the probability of detecting megapodes was significantly greater on islands without high human presence, significantly more detections were recorded in forests with dense or closed understory on those islands that supported greater human populations. Implications. Given their status and confined distribution in the Mariana Islands, additional studies investigating megapode incubation sites and movement within and between islands would provide fundamental information on megapode ecology and enhance conservation efforts. Continued and expanded ungulate removal, predator control, and habitat restoration would further enhance the likelihood of megapode persistence in the archipelago.

AB  - In the Anthropocene, the ranges of introduced species are expanding, while extinction-prone species are contracting. Introductions and extinctions are caused by how species respond to human impacts, but it is unknown why the ranges of some species expand and some contract. Here, we test whether this opposite response of human impact is due to introduced and extinction-prone species falling at opposite ends of geographic, evolutionary, or ecological trait continua. We constructed a database of native range maps, traits, phylogenetic relationships, and the introduction and extinction-prone status of squamate reptiles with ranges native to the Western Hemisphere. Across > 3000 snake and lizard species (88% of known native squamates), 142 had been introduced elsewhere and 483 were extinction-prone (i.e. vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild, extinct). To explain variation in status, we first tested if the same human-impacted regions in the Americas contained the native ranges of species of either status. Second, we tested for phylogenetic signal in species status. Finally, we tested the explanatory power of multiple trait continua. The native ranges of introduced and extinction-prone reptiles were clustered in island regions with high human impact versus mainland regions with lower human impact. Phylogenetic signal was weak for status, but introduced and extinction-prone species were clustered in different clades. All geographic and ecological traits that explained each status supported the opposite ends hypothesis. Introduced species had larger, edgier ranges, while extinction-prone species had smaller, simpler ranges. Introduced species were mostly herbivorous/omnivorous, while extinction-prone species were mostly carnivorous. Introduced species produced larger clutches, while extinction-prone species had smaller body sizes. In the Anthropocene, the native ranges of introduced and extinction-prone species are in the same human-impacted regions where trait continua, having opposite effects, determine whether species ranges expand or contract in the continuing face of global change.

AB  - European bison are susceptible to a range of pathogens which may influence their health, and hence, to ensure their protection, it is essential to provide effective monitoring of potential exposure. This study presents the first molecular confirmation of Sarcocystis cruzi infection in European bison based on PCR amplification of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) gene. A sample of heart tissue taken from one fifteen-year-old European bison cow was examined by light microscopy for the presence of heart sarcocysts. The genomic DNA isolated from any identified sarcocysts was subjected to PCR to amplify cox1 gene sequences, and the obtained amplicons were sequenced by Sanger dideoxy sequencing. Two partial cox1 sequences were obtained; they were identified as S. cruzi and deposited in the GenBankTM database under the accession numbers MW490605 and MW490606. BLAST analysis found them to demonstrate the closest similarity to S. levinei (MH255771-MH255779 and KU247874-KU247884), sharing an identity of 93.14-93.8 %. This is the first report to identify sarcocysts isolated from heart tissue of infected European bison living in the Bialowieza forest to species level using cox1 analysis. Our findings confirm that the European bison is a natural intermediate host for S. cruzi. As such, coordinators of future conservation programmes should consider the impact of these diseases on reintroduced animals.

AB  - Simple Summary The population of Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii) has increased over the past decades, but it is still threatened by a variety of environmental factors and human disturbance. Most of the suitable habitats for Przewalski's gazelle are limited to the vicinity of Qinghai Lake. Moreover, most of the suitable habitat for Przewalski's gazelle is not included in the scope of the reserve. Thus, conservation translocation may be an effective way of protecting Przewalski's gazelle.Abstract Although the population of Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii) has increased, this species is still threatened by a variety of risk factors, such as habitat loss and fragmentation, grassland fencing, grazing conflict, the segmentation of different populations, and declines in population genetic diversity. In order to determine the potential suitable habitat of Przewalski's gazelle and find a new suitable location for its conservation translocation, we used the MaxEnt model to predict the suitable habitats in Qinghai Province, Gansu Province, and the Ordos Plateau in Inner Mongolia and other regions with historical distribution records. On the basis of the MaxEnt model's prediction of the potential suitable habitat of Przewalski's gazelle, we used GAP analysis to determine the existing protection gaps and provide a new reference for the future protection of Przewalski's gazelle. We found that altitude, temperature, vegetation type, and distance from roads were the main environmental factors affecting the geographical distribution of Przewalski's gazelle. Most of the suitable habitat of Przewalski's gazelle is confined around Qinghai Lake. GAP analysis revealed that most of the suitable habitats of Przewalski's gazelle are not included in the established reserves, and Qinghai Lake National Nature Reserve only covers a small area around Qinghai Lake. The whole reserve only accounts for 7.11% of the area of the suitable habitat for Przewalski's gazelle and 15.79% of the area of the highly suitable habitat for Przewalski's gazelle. We suggest that conservation translocation for Przewalski's gazelle should be put on the agenda. It is necessary to consider reintroducing these gazelles into their potential suitable habitats as a feasible way of establishing new populations and saving this species.

AB  - Simple Summary Among insects of the soil megafauna in the Arctic and Subarctic, the species of subgenus Cryobious have demonstrated a high abundance and wide distribution. The fossil remains of Cryobius are used for paleoenvironmental reconstructions of the Arctic and Subarctic in the Pleistocene and Holocene. However, the taxonomy, ecology, and distribution of Cryobius are insufficiently studied. Here, we report that Pterostichus (Cryobius) mandibularoides Ball, 1966, previously known from the Nearctic, was found in Chukotka and on Wrangel Island. Thus, it is a trans-Beringian species with a wide distribution in the western part of North America and a disjunctive range within the northeastern margin of Asia. The phylogeny of P. mandibularoides determined using a genetic approach revealed inconformity with previous conclusions regarding its differentiation within the brevicornis group stock of subgenus Cryobius. Considering the taxonomic complexity of subgenus Cryobius, the fossil samples of brevicornis group species with radiocarbon dating may not correspond to the real time of species differentiation; consequently, additional revision using genetic tools is required. Subgenus Cryobius is one of the most numerous among the megafauna of tundra soils, but studies on its species distribution, taxonomy, and ecology are lacking. Phylogeny and phylogeography reconstructions of insects with taxonomic complexity have become possible using an integrative approach. Here, we report that specimens of Pterostichus (Cryobius) mandibularoides, described from North America, were detected in Eurasia. Thus, this species has a trans-Beringian range with high distributions in North America, as well as a disjunctive part of the range on the northeastern edge of Asia within Chukotka and Wrangel Island. Eight COI haplotypes with closed relationships (1-2 mutation steps) were detected within the whole range, and one 28S rRNA haplotype was detected for Eurasia. Bayesian phylogeny revealed that P. mandibularoides had the most recent common ancestor with sister species P. brevicornis and P. nivalis. Mean genetic distances of both markers were similar and higher between P. mandibularoides and both P. brevicornis and P. nivalis (>5% +/- 1.0%) than between the latter species (<4% +/- 1.0%). The obtained results change the previous view about brevicornis group stock differentiation within Cryobius in the Arctic and require a revision of the phylogeny and phylogeography of brevicornis group species and Cryobius altogether.

AB  - Rhizomatous growth and associated physiological integration can allow a clonal dune species to potentially compensate for the selective removal of leaves associated with herbivory. Hydrocotyle bonariensis is a rhizomatous clonal plant species that is abundant in the coastal dune environments of the southeastern United States that are inhabited by large feral horse populations. H. bonariensis has been shown to integrate resources among ramets within extensive clones as an adaptation to resource heterogeneity in sandy soils. In this study, we hypothesized that clonal integration is a mechanism that promotes H. bonariensis persistence in these communities, despite high levels of herbivory by feral horses. In a field experiment, we used exclosures to test for herbivory in H. bonariensis over a four-month period. We found that feral horses utilized H. bonariensis as a food species, and that while grazing will suppress clonal biomass, H. bonariensis is able to maintain populations in a high grazing regime with and without competition present. We then conducted an experiment in which portions of H. bonariensis clones were clipped to simulate different levels of grazing. Half of the clones were severed to eliminate the possibility of integration. We found that after 12 weeks, the mean number of leaves and ramets increased as the grazing level increased, for integrated clones. Integrated clones had significantly increased biomass production compared to the severed equivalents. Our research suggests that rhizomatous growth and physiological integration are traits that allow clonal plant species to maintain populations and to tolerate grazing in coastal dune environments.

AB  - Hawaiian avifaunal communities have suffered irrevocable harm and significant threats remain for extant species. It is increasingly important to monitor and document bird density to improve our understanding of how remaining species respond to changing climate and emergent stressors. In this paper, we report annual densities (2003-2020) of two native and four non-native forest bird species in a region of Hawai ' i Island lacking previous estimates. We estimated long-term population trends and short-term trajectories within a Bayesian framework. Our findings support previous studies that demonstrated the negative impact of ungulate browsing on forest bird habitat. We also note a detection of the Japanese Bush Warbler ( Cettia diphone ), a recently documented nonnative species. The forest bird population trends presented here fill a regional gap and help extend the understanding of bird populations on Hawai ' i Island.

AB  - Sea turtle nesting brings marine-derived nutrients into sandy beach ecosystems, potentially influencing their dynamics. We investigated nutrient input from green turtle Chelonia mydas eggs and hatchlings into coastal habitats in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa. We assessed two islands within the Jo & atilde;o Vieira-Poil & atilde;o Marine National Park ('JVPMNP'), with contrasting sea turtle nesting density: very low (Jo & atilde;o Vieira) and very high (Poil & atilde;o). On each island, we analyzed stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in one pair of plant species (coinvine Dalbergia ecastaphyllum bush/baobab Adansonia digitata tree) and two pairs of predator species (tufted ghost crab Ocypode cursor/African rainbow crab Cardisoma armatum and sea catfish Carlarius spp./crevalle jack Caranx hippos). The first species in each pair is distributed closer to nesting sites, while the second is found further inland or offshore. Stomach content analysis was also conducted for fishes. Results supported nutrient input from turtle clutches benefiting the species living near nesting sites. Shoreline coinvines at Poil & atilde;o had higher delta 15N (5.1 +/- 3.2 parts per thousand) compared to Jo & atilde;o Vieira (approximate to 0 parts per thousand), suggesting assimilation of turtle-derived 15N. Shoreline tufted ghost crabs at Poil & atilde;o had enriched delta 15N (15.2 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand vs. Jo & atilde;o Vieira's 12.2 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand) and delta 13C (- 13.4 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand vs. Jo & atilde;o Vieira's - 18.7 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand), likely reflecting predation upon eggs and hatchlings. Sea catfishes at Poil & atilde;o frequently consumed unhatched turtle eggs washed into the sea (17% frequency of occurrence) and hatchlings (up to 27%). This study suggests that nutrient availability from turtle nests influences and supports shoreline plants and consumers at JVPMNP.

AB  - Mexican gray wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) reintroduction began in 1998 in Arizona, USA, with 11 individuals initially; wolves from this population dispersed into New Mexico, USA, the following year. Numbers of wolves have steadily increased (& GE;241 individuals in Dec 2022) and the size of the recovery area has expanded in both states. Understanding kill rates is fundamental to the recovery and management of Mexican wolves to properly maintain a healthy and sustainable population of wolves and their prey species. We used global positioning system (GPS) cluster analysis to locate kill sites and estimate kill rates on native ungulate prey taken in the recovery area by 10 Mexican wolf groups during winter (15 Feb-15 Mar) and 8 wolf groups during summer (15 Jun-15 Jul) in 2015-2017. Elk (Cervus canadensis) composed 94% of the native ungulates documented at Mexican wolf kill sites (n = 139); the remaining 6% were mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus; n = 9). Two-thirds of all wolf-killed native ungulates were elk calves. We estimated kill rates as ungulate biomass killed/wolf/day. From combined results for all years, we estimated that each Mexican wolf killed on average 9.0 & PLUSMN; 5.4 kg (& PLUSMN;95% CI) of ungulate biomass per day during winter and 7.8 & PLUSMN; 6.2 kg during the summer. Our estimates of kill rates could be overestimated if Mexican wolves obtained a substantial amount of their biomass from scavenging, particularly during 4 months of hunting seasons (Sep-Dec) not captured in winter and summer. Using data from the first 2 years of the study (2015, 2016), we developed a logistic regression model to predict probability of an elk kill occurring at a GPS cluster as a function of hours spent by a collared wolf at that GPS cluster and size of the wolf group. Applying this model to the final year of the study (2017) resulted in similar numbers of predicted (n = 16.1 and 27.2 in winter and summer, respectively) and observed numbers (n = 15 and 26) of elk kills. Additionally, the demographic composition of the 2017 elk kills closely matched that of the previous 2 years. The results of this study indicate similar predation patterns of Mexican wolves to those of wolves in northern locations and can help wildlife managers plan for potential effects from a larger population of wolves across a broad area in Arizona and New Mexico.

AB  - PremiseUnderstanding relationships among grass traits, fire, and herbivores may help improve conservation strategies for savannas that are threatened by novel disturbance regimes. Emerging theory, developed in Africa, emphasizes that functional traits of savanna grasses reflect the distinct ways that fire and grazers consume biomass. Specifically, functional trade-offs related to flammability and palatability predict that highly flammable grass species will be unpalatable, while highly palatable species will impede fire. MethodsWe quantified six culm and leaf traits of 337 native grasses of Texas-a historical savanna region that has been transformed by fire exclusion, megafaunal extinctions, and domestic livestock. ResultsMultivariate analyses of traits revealed three functional strategies. "Grazer grasses" (N = 50) had culms that were short, narrow, and horizontal, and leaves with high width to length (W:L) and low C to N ratios (C:N)-trait values that attract grazers and avoid fire. "Fire grasses" (N = 104) had culms that were tall, thick, and upright, and leaves that were thick, with low W:L, and high C:N-trait values that promote fire and discourage grazers. "Generalist tolerators" and "generalist avoiders" (N = 183) had trait values that were intermediate to the other groups. ConclusionsOur findings confirm that the flammability-palatability trade-offs that operate in Africa also explain correlated suites of traits in Texas grasses and highlights that the grass flora of Texas bears the signature of Pleistocene megafauna and the influence of fires that predate human arrival. We suggest that grass functional classifications based on fire and grazer traits can improve prescribed fire and livestock management of savannas of Texas and globally.

AB  - American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh) Borkh.), once a co-dominant canopy species in eastern U.S. forests, has been functionally extinct for almost a century. Hybrid American-Chinese chestnuts, with the potential to be blight-resistant, present an opportunity to study its functional niche. The objective of this research was to identify silvicultural strategies related to light, herbivory, and competition for increasing the success of hybrid chestnut (BC3F3 generation) plantings in an Appalachian cove forest ecosystem in West Virginia (WV). Large and small circular canopy gaps were created to manipulate light with the prediction that seedlings would perform best in larger gaps. Within these gaps, landscape fabric was added to half of the seedlings to decrease vegetative competition and 30.5 cm tall tree shelters were placed around half of the seedlings to help mitigate rodent predation. After five years, results show an interaction between landscape fabric and gap size whereby landscape fabric had a positive effect on seedling height in large gaps but not in small gaps (p < 0.05). Survival was dependent on interactions between treatments with the highest seedling survival (80%) in small gaps with tree shelters and landscape fabric. Differences between treatments were less pronounced in large gaps where survival was much lower (45%). In conclusion, seedlings are likely to have the greatest long-term survival if they are planted in smaller gaps protected from vegetative competition and rodent predation.

AB  - The island of Taiwan represents an ideal context for studying the effects of climatic oscillations and topographic variation on large herbivores due to its varied tropical to sub-tropical climate zones at different elevational ranges. We explored the phylogenetics of Formosan sambar deer (Rusa unicolor swinhoii) using the control region of the mitochondrial genome. We detected 18 haplotypes among 454 sequences across the island and grouped them into six regions based on SAMOVA, with 68.78% variance among regions. A Bayesian phylogenetic dendrogram revealed two spatially segregated genetic clades. Neutrality tests and Bayesian skyline plots uncovered different demographic expansion histories for the two clades. We further tested divergence times and chronology to propose potential phylogenetic scenarios, which were examined using approximate Bayesian computation. Finally, we present a credible hypothesis for a glacial refugium in the northern part of the Central Mountain Range. Subsequent secondary contact between the two clades during interglacial periods has led to the extant genetic structure of Formosan sambar deer.

AB  - For Inuit in the subarctic transition zone of northeastern Canada, an intimate knowledge of the environment and local biodiversity is crucial for successful traditional activities. This study examines what kinds of landscape features and habitats Inuit of Nunatsiavut recognize and name. During interviews, community members (mostly Elders) were shown photographs from the region and were asked to describe and name salient types of places in Labrador Inuttitut. The most frequently reported geographical units dealt with the region's topography (e.g., mountain, island, flat-place), hydrology (e.g., river, bay), and superficial characteristics (e.g., bedrock, permanent snow patch). Ecological considerations were also prominent, such as plant associations and animal habitats (e.g., shrubby-place, wetland, caribou-return to-place). Areas were often characterized by a dominant species or substrate type, being named using the plural form of the species and (or)substrate (e.g., "napattuk" meaning 'tree' and "napattuit" meaning 'forest' or "siugak" meaning 'sand' and "siugalak" meaning 'sandy-area'). Some types of places reported by Inuit were significant mainly for traditional activities (e.g., berry-patch, seal-place, dry-wood-place, danger place), aiding navigation and resource finding. Integrating Inuit conceptions of ecosystems and their component landscape units with those of contemporary science can improve our understanding of subarctic ecology, benefit climate change adaptation strategies, and Inuit language as well as culture conservation initiatives.

AB  - Deep-sea precious corals in the octocoral family Coralliidae are among the dominant benthic megafauna at depths of 300-600 m on seamounts of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and lower Emperor Seamount Chain. Pleurocorallium secundum and Hemicorallium laauense were once abundant enough on these seamounts to support a targeted coral fishery in the 1960s and 1970s. Significant trawl finfish fisheries were also occurring in the same time frame on the same seamounts. Because they had high enough abundance to support a targeted fishery for two decades, these two coralliid species must have been a key component of the baseline community on these seamounts. Therefore, they provide an ideal indicator species for testing effects of large-scale disturbance and potential for recovery in deep-sea coral and seamount communities. Using AUVs and submersibles, we explored seamounts outside the US EEZ that are still actively fished by trawl, seamounts within the US EEZ that were historically trawled but have been protected since the establishment of the EEZ, and seamounts that have never been trawled, to determine population distributions and colony sizes for the targeted coral species. P. secundum had only one individual on actively trawled seamounts and occurred in low abundance on most Recovering seamounts. H. laauense was present in a few areas in Recovering and Still Trawled seamounts. Colony size dis-tributions for H. laauense showed a smaller median size on Recovering and Still Trawled seamounts compared to the Never Trawled sites. P. secundum had a slightly smaller median colony size on the Recovering Seamounts than on the Never Trawled seamounts. These results indicate a reduction in abundance for both species in disturbed areas with some unexpected potential for recovery on protected seamounts. Recovery was uneven among sites and species with SE Hancock and Koko showing the largest populations of H. laauense among the Recovering and Still Trawled seamounts, respectively. P. secundum showed much less recovery, with its largest population on Bank 11 in the Recovering seamounts. Kammu, one of the primary seamounts of the coral fishery, had only a single coralliid observed. The other primary target, Yuryaku, had a small number of coralliids in a steeply sloped area. These two Still Trawled seamounts do not appear to be able to recover under the current levels of fishing pressure.

AB  - Non-native plants can affect communities through direct competition, and by providing refuge to seed predators, creating apparent competition with native plants. Ammophila arenaria (European beachgrass) has been introduced to coastal dune habitats throughout the western United States, where it forms dense monocultures, stabilizes dunes, and alters abiotic and biotic conditions. The dominance of European beachgrass is linked to declines of Lupinus tidestromii (Tidestrom's lupine), an herb endemic to coastal dune communities in central and northern California. Peromyscus sonoriensis (western deer mice), a native seed predator, use beachgrass as refuge from predators. Tidestrom's lupine near European beachgrass stands experience greater predation pressure from deer mice. At Point Reyes National Seashore, California, USA (PRNS), mechanical removal, manual pulling, and herbicide treatment have been used to reduce the density of European beachgrass near Tidestrom's lupine populations. We trapped deer mice at five sites in PRNS that experienced different management regimes and used spatially-explicit capture-recapture models to estimate deer mouse density as a function of site and habitat treatment. We found that deer mouse density was lowest in areas where European beachgrass was mechanically removed and in herbicide-treated foredunes, and highest in areas highly invaded by European beachgrass and Carpobrotus spp. (iceplant). Deer mouse density increased from 2021 to 2022 at every site except one that underwent extensive mechanical removal of European beachgrass from 2010-2011. This study shows enduring effects of European beachgrass removal on the density of a native seed predator and highlights the importance of habitat management for conservation of Tidestrom's lupine.

AB  - Wildlife translocations are an important conservation tool but can be challenging for the animals. For translocations to be successful, animals must adjust to their release landscape. Investigating how animals acclimate to their release landscapes can improve post-release monitoring and inform about the management needs of translocated populations. We investigated movements and resource selection dynamics of 106 elk (Cervus canadensis) during the first 6-8 years following their release to Missouri, USA in 2011-2013. We observed evidence of spatial acclimation as determined by cessation of changes in resource selection together with monthly range sizes and fidelity of individual elk. Females showed faster evidence of acclimation in their movements following release than males. Although range fidelity for both sexes stabilized within approximately seven months, range size stabilized within approximately three months for females and stabilization began within approximately 11 months for males. Selection for multiple resources by elk also largely stabilized within their first year following release. A simple refuge-forage trade-off alone did not explain acclimation in resource selection. Elk selected for high-quality food plots across the temporal extent of restoration regardless of time since release, whereas their selection for cover resources during summer increased after elk acclimated. Together, spatial acclimation generally lagged behind physiological responses observed in this system, adding to the increasing evidence that translocated animals display acclimation patterns across trait-specific time periods. Our approach demonstrates the utility of accounting for acclimation effects across multiple spatial response metrics for improving post-release monitoring, evaluation, and management of restored wildlife populations.

AB  - This study is the first systematic assessment of large herbivore (LH) communities in Limpopo National Park (LNP) in Mozambique, an area where most LH species were extinct until the early 2000s. We investigate whether LH community parameters are linked with the availability of habitat types or the distance between sampling sites and the origin of LH resettlement. We placed camera traps in five habitat types in resettled and not-resettled areas to compare species richness, relative abundance index, grazers-browsers-mixed feeder and naive occupancy of 15 LH species. While the richness decreased along the distance gradient of LH resettlement, relative abundance index strongly responded to habitat features. The grazer-browser-mixed feeder ratio oscillated, while from resettled to not-resettled areas, the ratio increased. Most species show a wide distribution range. The associations of most LH community parameters with habitat types rather than distance to initial release, together with the species-specific and guild-specific response patterns of LH, suggest LNP to already be in an intermediate stage of restoration. Our results highlight the importance of post-release monitoring of reintroduced wildlife as a tool to assess the success of ecological restoration initiatives in transboundary conservation areas.

AB  - According to the latest global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services, nature and biodiversity have experienced a global decline, making the development of conservation policies urgent. Herein, we used a contingent valuation survey to estimate the economic value of a reintroduction program for the huemul ( Hip- pocamelus bisulcus ), an endangered charismatic species in Chile. Our novel approach exploits changes in the access to the site to disentangle nonuse value from use value. We use parametric and nonparametric models to estimate the willingness to pay for the program. Our findings consistently indicate that the conservation of the huemul is valued more when tourist access is restricted, as opposed to allowing visitors access to reintroduction areas. We also analyze the sensitivity of this main finding to different cut-off points of a certainty scale, showing that the results are robust. We hypothesize that people are willing to pay a "premium" to keep the conservation site "out of sight" from tourist activities. This could also be related to the belief that a reintroduction program would be more effective if access was not allowed. A cost -benefit analysis using the most conservative assumptions suggests that social benefit significantly outperforms cost.

AB  - Understanding the dynamics between native and invasive species in aquatic ecosystems is crucial for effective conservation and management. This study investigates the diet composition and niche overlap of the native paradise fish (Pseudosphromenus dayi) and the introduced three-spot gourami (Trichopodus trichopterus) in a coastal wetland in Kerala, India. Through a comprehensive diet analysis, the study aims to reveal trophic dynamics and potential competition between these coexisting species. A substantial diet overlap of 0.73 indicates significant resource sharing, particularly in detritus, plant matter, Chlorophyta, insect remains, Cyanophyta, and Crustacea, highlighting a pronounced interaction between the paradise fish and three-spot gourami. Abundant resources in the wetland likely alleviate interspecific competition, facilitating the coexistence of both species. The presence of microplastics in the gut of both species signals increased human intervention and plastic pollution in the watershed and wetland. These findings underscore the importance of considering dietary preferences and ecological behaviours in assessing interactions between native and invasive species. Effective management strategies are crucial to mitigate potential competition and maintain the ecological integrity of wetland habitats. Continuous monitoring of invasive freshwater fishes is recommended for early detection and the implementation of management plans to address potential threats.

AB  - Understanding the forces that drive genotypic and phenotypic change in wild populations is a central goal of evolutionary biology. We examined exome variation in populations of deer mice from two of the California Channel Islands: Peromyscus maniculatus elusus from Santa Barbara Island and P. m. santacruzae from Santa Cruz Island exhibit significant differences in olfactory predator recognition, activity timing, aggressive behavior, morphology, prevalence of Sin Nombre virus, and population densities. We characterized variation in protein-coding regions using exome capture and sequencing of 25 mice from Santa Barbara Island and 22 mice from Santa Cruz Island. We identified and examined 386,256 SNPs using three complementary methods (BayeScan, pcadapt, and LFMM). We found strong differences in molecular variation between the two populations and 710 outlier SNPs in protein-coding genes that were detected by all three methods. We identified 35 candidate genes from this outlier set that were related to differences in phenotypes between island populations. Enrichment analyses demonstrated that patterns of molecular variation were associated with biological processes related to response to chemical stimuli and regulation of immune processes. Candidate genes associated with olfaction (Gfy, Tlr2, Vmn13r2, numerous olfactory receptor genes), circadian activity (Cry1), anxiety (Brca1), immunity (Cd28, Eif2ak4, Il12a, Syne1), aggression (Cyp19a, Lama2), and body size (Bc16, Syne1) exhibited non-synonymous mutations predicted to have moderate to large effects. Variation in olfaction-related genes, including a stop codon in the Santa Barbara Island population, suggests loss of predator-recognition traits at the molecular level, consistent with a lack of behavioral aversion to fox feces. These findings also suggest that divergent pathogen prevalence and population density may have influenced adaptive immunity and behavioral phenotypes, such as reduced aggression. Overall, our study indicates that ecological differences between islands are associated with signatures of selection in protein-coding genes underlying phenotypes that promote success in those environments.

AB  - We review the recent rise to prominence in Aotearoa New Zealand of predation-focused conservation management, critically assessing the likelihood that this will deliver outcomes consistent with national biodiversity goals. Using a review of literature describing the impacts and control of three groups of introduced mammals (wild ungulates, brushtail possums, and predators), we identify shifts in management emphasis over a century of conservation decision-making in Aotearoa. Predators are now a major focus and wild ungulates are left largely uncontrolled, despite increasing populations and evidence for their negative impacts on a wide range of indigenous species and ecosystems. This imbalance in management effort, which appears to be influenced increasingly by socio-political pressures, is much less likely to deliver outcomes consistent with Aotearoa's biodiversity goals than a systematic approach that addresses a full range of biodiversity threats. Overall, we interpret these shortcomings as reflecting long recognised issues with the governance and leadership of Aotearoa's biodiversity system. Changes are required to provide adequate, stable funding, improve clarity around goals, leadership, responsibilities and accountabilities, strengthen planning and prioritisation of management actions, and coordinate management among various conservation actors. We also argue for (1) a stronger role for ecological sciences through independent research aimed at strengthening the evidence base for management actions, and (2) explicit inclusion of science expertise in conservation policy development and management decision making. While recent extensive, landscape-scale predator control has caught the imagination of many and has undoubtedly delivered some gains for a small subset of indigenous species, it also risks creating a false sense of achievement that diverts attention away from other serious gaps in progress towards achieving national biodiversity goals. We make 12 recommendations to address these shortcomings.

AB  - Understanding the mechanism by which non-native fish species integrate into native communities is crucial for evaluating the possibility of their establishment success. The genus Pangasianodon, comprising Pangasianodon gigas and Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, has been introduced into reservoirs, which are non-native habitats, for fishery stock enhancement. P. gigas and P. hypophthalmus often successfully establish and co-occur in several Thai reservoirs, but there is little information on differences in food resource use between the two species. To investigate the trophic niche width of P. gigas and P. hypophthalmus in a Thai reservoir, we conducted stable carbon and nitrogen ratio (delta C-13 and delta N-15) analyses. We examined the degree of individual specialization in both species using the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of muscle and liver tissues, which provides long- and short-term diet information. The isotopic niches did not overlap between P. gigas and P. hypophthalmus. The delta N-15 value of P. gigas was significantly higher than that of P. hypophthalmus, whereas the delta C-13 value did not significantly differ between the two species. The isotopic niche sizes were larger in P. hypophthalmus than in P. gigas. Individual specialization was observed in P. hypophthalmus but not in P. gigas, indicating that intraspecific variation in food resource use was larger in P. hypophthalmus compared to P. gigas. These findings suggest that trophic niche partitioning was one of the factors facilitating the establishment success of P. gigas and P. hypophthalmus in a reservoir, but the establishment process may differ between the two species.

AB  - Erosion of coral substrate plays a crucial role in reef calcium carbonate budget, but little is known about erosion in subtropical corals. In a 2-year study of coral substrate erosion, we deployed Porites skeletal blocks at nine sites across subtropical Hong Kong waters. External erosion varied from 0.05 to 3.07 kg m- 2 yr- 1 and accounted for 23.4-99.2% of the total erosion. More than half of the study sites had substantial external erosion (> 1 kg m- 2 yr- 1), and the values were positively correlated with density of the sea urchin Diadema setosum. Excluding urchins from access to the skeletal blocks using cages reduced external erosion by more than 90%. Overall, our study revealed that external erosion caused by urchin grazing contributed predominantly to the total coral skeletal loss in Hong Kong waters. Control of sea urchin population is needed to reduce coral erosion in places with high urchin density. (149 words).

AB  - Background and Aims There is ongoing debate about whether offspring perform best next to phylogenetically distantly related adult neighbours (due to the scarcity of enemies and competitors) or next to closely related adults (due to the abundance of mutualists). Here we hypothesize that relatedness of adult neighbours affects which traits confer performance rather than performance itself. Methods We studied seed removal, seed germination and sapling growth in sessile oaks (Quercus petraea and hybrids) and how they depend on size, shape and other traits, under both closely and distantly related canopies, manipulating offspring density, presence of insects and fungi, and spatial proximity to oaks. Key Results We found that phylogenetic distance of adult neighbours affects only little the performance of offspring but strongly affects which traits confer performance on offspring, in particular the size and shape of seeds and saplings. Differences in trait-performance relationships mostly disappear once insects or conspecific competitors are excluded (albeit exclusion of fungi reinforced these differences). Effects of phylogenetic distance of neighbours were not replaceable by the percentage of gymnosperms among neighbours or by the environmental conditions considered. Conclusions We suggest that, by responding to a biotic micro-mosaic of selection pressures, sessile oak flexibly succeeds in diverse neighbourhoods. Sessile oak might maintain the potential for both convergence with and divergence from phylogenetically distantly related species, thereby reinforcing or eroding phylogenetic signal of niches.

AB  - Chinese domestic pig breeds have abundant genetic resources, but definite information about the geogra-phic specificity and genetic structure is lacking. In this study, we analysed 359 mitochondrial D-loop sequ-ences, including 86 sequences from Chinese domestic pigs and the rest downloaded from GenBank. The haplotype and nucleotide diversity indices ranged from 0.467 +/- 0.132 (Duroc) to 1.000 +/- 0.500 (Thailand, North Korea and Cambodia) and 0.00067 +/- 0.00019 (Duroc) to 0.02000 +/- 0.01000 (Thailand), respectively. The neighbour-joining tree revealed two clads in the individual pigs, with a Chinese domestic breed distri-buted discontinuously among several breeds. The network data indicated that the gene pools of Chinese domestic pigs are likely related to Chinese, Japanese and some other Southeast Asian wild boars.

AB  - Invasive species management is promoted as a general practice to maintain rangeland biodiversity and mitigate livestock performance losses (e.g., weight gain) stemming from invasive-species effects (e.g., competitive exclusion of palatable forages). It is hypothesized that altering fire-timing (e.g., moving from early to late-growing season burning) or integrating herbicide application into fire management regimes may lead to more successful reduction of certain invasive species without negatively affecting livestock weight gains. However, large-scale, replicated experimental evidence linking invasive species abundance or management practices to cattle weight gain is mostly lacking across grasslands. We manipulated eight large (333 - 766 ha) pastures managed with fire and grazing (i.e., pyric herbivory) to test how growing (i.e., August-September) and dormant (i.e., March-April) season fires, herbicide application, or invasive species abundance (namely Lespedeza cuneata) affected yearling stocker cattle weight gain - i.e., per head weight gain - from 2018 to 2020. We found that yearling stocker cattle gained significantly less weight in pastures burned during the growing season, and her-bicide application did not increase weight gains overall. Moreover, we did not find a significant relationship between L. cuneata abundance and per head yearling stocker cattle weight gain. Our results add to a growing line of evidence that invasive species management does not always benefit livestock producers. The hypothesized negative relationship between invasive species abundance and cattle weight gain may be minimal (or neutral) across large grassland landscapes, particularly those managed with pyric herbivory. To date, pyric herbivory is the only management regime known to simultaneously promote biodiversity, and restrict some invasive plant species like L. cuneata.

AB  - Human-mediated introductions and subsequent establishment and spread of nonnative species have the potential to create a founder effect in such populations, which typically results in low genetic diversity and potential for inbreeding. However, several exotic invasive species exhibit a "genetic paradox" in which they thrive and adapt to novel environments while also avoiding complications from low genetic diversity. Axis deer (Axis axis) were introduced into Texas, Hawaii, South America, Australia, and Croatia during the 19th and 20th centuries and successfully established large populations from a few founding individuals. Mitochondrial (Cytochrome-b, Cytb; displacement loop, D-loop) and nuclear (10 microsatellites) markers were used to assess genetic diversity within and between axis deer populations in Texas and Hawaii and then compared to other introduced (Australia and Croatia) and native (India) populations. Overall, mtDNA divergence was 0.54% (Cytb) and 1.55% (D-loop) indicating high mitochondrial similarity within the species. Further, each invasive population was composed of only one or two mtDNA haplotypes. Microsatellite allele diversity also was low within and between populations in Texas and Hawaii resulting in monomorphic loci and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium violations in both populations. The low genetic diversity in native Indian axis deer and within and between invasive populations suggests that the introduced populations experienced founder effects following introduction, and yet overcame this potential handicap by undergoing successful establishment and expansion. Axis deer appear to be another successful invasive species characterized by the genetic paradox where they exhibit genetic profiles that suggest inbreeding effects should be imminent, yet display no signs of inbreeding and are highly successful adapting to novel environments.

AB  - Plant pathogens are often hypothesized to promote species coexistence by generating conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD). However, the relative importance of fungal versus oomycete pathogens in maintaining plant species coexistence and community composition remains unresolved, despite their recognized effects on plant performance. Here, we use fungicide application to investigate how fungal versus oomycete pathogens affect plant species coexistence in an alpine meadow. We found that the severity of foliar fungal disease was density-dependent at both intra- and interspecific levels. Fungal pathogen-exclusion treatment successfully decreased the severity of foliar fungal diseases, with no detectable effects on root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi or on soil chemical properties. Fungal pathogens were important factors shaping CNDD across 25 coexisting plant species. Exclusion of fungal pathogens significantly reduced plant species richness and Shannon's evenness. Treatments that excluded fungal pathogens also led to significant shifts in plant community composition toward more Poaceae and Cyperaceae. These results indicate that fungal pathogens, especially those affecting aboveground plant parts, may play a larger role in maintaining species coexistence and shaping community composition than has been previously recognized.

AB  - Population restoration is an inherently costly conservation practice typically reliant on animal translocations. There are many approaches to translocation and consideration is paid to understanding how various translocation models influence restoration success. Translocation strategies are often designed to meet site-specific objectives, minimize cost, and maximize success. We investigated genetic diversity retention associated with the low-founder, multi-release, single admixed stock translocation model of the Missouri elk (Cervus canadensis) restoration in 2011-2013. We further estimated effective population size and projected future losses in genetic diversity if the restored Missouri elk herd is maintained at the population size objective with no immigration from neighboring states. We observed relatively high levels of genetic diversity retention as evidenced by minimal losses in allelic richness and expected heterozygosity. Our projections indicated 90% genetic diversity retention within the Missouri population for roughly 130 years. Where number of progeny or source stocks are limited by resource or disease considerations, use of a relatively low-founder, single admixed source may enable retention of genetic variation, while minimizing costs.

AB  - We document the presence of a huemul population on Cabo Leon, Riesco Island, Chilean Patagonia 15 years after its first assessment, providing ecological insights for this southernmost coastal population. During Austral spring 2018 we recorded indirect signs of huemul presence and five individuals including one yearling across 35 km of trails, estimating a density of 2.3 ind/km(2). Records were distributed in dense secondary forest, at low elevations and slopes. These observations suggest the presence of a breeding population, favored by the establishment of a private reserve and the reduction of livestock, along with the recently established Kawesqar National Park.

AB  - Trindade is a remote island far from 1170 km of the Brazilian coast in the Atlantic Ocean, between South America and South Africa. The island has great biodiversity and scientific studies on the fauna and flora of Trindade are still scarce. Accordingly, since crustacean species of the island are also little known, this research features an unprecedented data set, which provides information on the level of potential toxic elements in two crab species: the Grapsus grapsus (herbivore) and the endemic species Gecarcinus lagostoma (omnivorous) which is in threatened status. Although Trindade has experienced contamination from human activities, mainly plastic debris, the element levels found in the samples suggest that there are no relevant inorganic sources into the island. Since minor and trace elements accumulated by marine invertebrates does not present a pattern behavior, our results can support other studies focused on the impact of global warming to the marine ecosystem.

AB  - Dugong feeding trails serve as crucial indicators for monitoring the presence and foraging areas of dugongs within seagrass ecosystems. This study aimed to evaluate the community structure of seagrass meadows, nutrient concentrations, and their relationship to dugong feeding trails in the intertidal seagrass regions around Libong Island, Thailand, during the dry and wet seasons of 2022. Seagrass cover was found to be variable but generally sparse, averaging 22.92% of the sea floor. Most seagrass species exhibited similar carbon and nitrogen concentrations; however, the highest frequency of dugong feeding trails was recorded in meadows dominated by Halophila ovalis, the most prevalent species at our research sites. This finding suggests that seagrass availability plays a more significant role in influencing foraging patterns than nutrient composition. Additionally, larger dugongs were observed to be more active during the dry season, while calves were more frequently seen in the wet season as certain seagrass areas became more accessible. The absence of dugong trails in some locations during the wet season indicates potential shifts in habitat use due to seasonal changes in seagrass availability. This study has important implications for dugong conservation and highlights the benefits of monitoring feeding trails to better understand habitat use, population demographics, and seasonal activity variations.

AB  - Diadema antillarum is a keystone herbivore that controls algal cover on coral reefs, as reductions in this species has been associated with significant increases in algal cover. However, most of the evidence that supports this model comes from observational studies where processes have been inferred from descriptions of temporal and spatial relationships. Within this context, a manipulative experiment was conducted to test the effects of D. antillarum densities and rugosity on benthic assemblages. The experiment consisted of fencing 1m(2) experimental plots (metal fence corrals) of high and low rugosity where different densities (0, 1, 5 and 10 individuals/m(2)) of D. antillarum were enclosed per plot. Inside these plots, three permanent and random 100cm(2) photoquadrats were taken during eight sampling times (six months) to estimate temporal change in benthic cover. Multivariate and univariate analyses indicated that: 1) presence of D. antillarum significantly decreased turf algae (from 90% to 4%) and Dictyota (from 25% to 0%) cover and increased clean substrate (from 0% to 72%) at both sites; 2) herbivory rates for low rugosity were different from high rugosity herbivory rates; 3) densities of 1 D. antillarum individual/m(2) did not change algal cover; 4) a minimum of 5 D. antillarum individuals/m(2) were required to maintain low algal cover on low and high rugosity experimental units. Based on these results we suggest that D. antillarum can effectively enhance coral reef health by decreasing algal cover and creating clean substrate. For restoration efforts, optimal densities of 5 D. antillarum individuals/m(2) should be considered when restocking individuals to coral reefs.

AB  - Tropical regions are undergoing rapid land use change, with major implications for global biodiversity. Selective logging and agroforestry are particularly widespread across tropical forests, often occurring in close proximity. But while a number of studies have addressed their impacts separately, few have directly compared how they influence forest vertebrates. Here, we assessed the occurrence of medium- to large-bodied mammals in logged forest, unlogged forest, and agroforestry areas in three study areas in interior Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. We detected 34 species across 99 camera trap locations and used multi-species occupancy models to estimate species-specific occurrence while accounting for imperfect detectability, spatial autocorrelation, natural habitat heterogeneity, and metrics of site accessibility (distance to human infrastructure) as proxies for potential hunting pressure. We found that species occurrences were unaffected by the distance to the nearest road or village and only responded to elevation and the distance to the nearest river in a single species each. Detection rates tended to vary with micro-habitat characteristics such as the size of tree stumps and the prevalence of trees and rattan palms, which are often not considered in camera-based occupancy studies. Occurrence rates of five species varied across habitat types but were not detectably lower in agroforestry sites than in unlogged forest for any species. Our results indicate that without unsustainable hunting, agroforestry and logged forest provide usable habitat for some, though not all, rainforest mammals. We also suggest that camera trap studies may benefit from the incorporation of fine-scale habitat information into detectability estimation. Abstract in Malaysian is available with online material.

AB  - Continuation of archaeobotanical and palaeoecological research on three semi-artificial lake islands, Nowy Dworek, Chycina and Lubniewice, has provided new information on the history, development and use of grasslands in Ziemia Lubuska (Lubusz land) in western Poland during the early Middle Ages. Pollen analysis reveals that the reduction in woodland and opening up of the regional landscape and the appearance of grassland communities there began around the 7th century ad, which preceded the construction of the islands in the lakes. The analysis of plant macroremains collected from the settlement layers on these islands, of pollen from cores in the lakes and studies of the phytosociological plant communities of recent vegetation have helped to describe the botanical composition of these past meadows and pastures. The results show strong similarities between the three sites, which suggests that the local populations were using the same grassland types, which were on soils ranging from damp to rather dry and sandy. The main grassland in the vicinity of the islands included the Molinio-Arrhenatheretea syntaxonomical class of communities, although Festuco-Brometea grasslands were also present. The presence of plant remains associated with various other types of meadows and pastures shows the diversity of habitats represented by the plant remains.

AB  - Many Galapagos giant tortoises make seasonal migrations from arid lowlands in the wet season, to humid highlands in the dry season. However, for critically endangered Western Santa Cruz giant tortoises (Chelonoidis porteri), at least 88% of the habitat in the highlands is now used for agriculture. To understand the impact of agricultural land use on tortoise behavior, we conducted 242 30-minute observations of tortoises on farms. We (1) recorded the time tortoises spent eating, walking, and resting in three different land-use types, (2) measured their temperature, and (3) quantified their selection of fine-scale vegetation characteristics. We found that tortoises rest for significantly longer periods when they are in abandoned land, compared to livestock, grazing, and touristic land. Generally, tortoises rested for longer when they were cooler. Time spent eating was increased by the density and proportion of ground vegetation, while time spent walking was reduced by tall vegetation. These findings suggest that the distribution of land-use types and the fine-scale composition of thermoregulatory and grazing resources within farmland have important implications for the behavior of tortoises while in human-modified land. Wildlife managers and landowners wishing to support tortoises on farms should focus on rehabilitating abandoned land and encouraging a heterogenous mix of sun and shade, and short ground vegetation across land-use types.

AB  - The disparities in the ecology and behavior of marine megafauna may influence their susceptibility to solid waste ingestion; however, this relationship has been underestimated along the Brazilian coast. We analyzed a dataset of 7261 marine megafauna (45 species) necropsied to investigate the influence of their foraging strategies on solid waste ingestion. A total of 1240 specimens ingested solid waste with over 55 % (689) that ingested plastic. Sea turtles were the most impacted taxa, while cetaceans present the lowest frequency. Some characteristics such as regurgitation (e.g., Suliformes and Charadriiformes seabirds) or possess complex foraging strategies (e.g., ceta-ceans echolocation) may mitigate the negative effects of solid waste ingestion. Also, the variability over the monitoring program likely was influenced by the volume of pollutants transported to the ocean during flood periods, and level of staff training. This study serves as a valuable baseline for solid waste management actions and marine megafauna conservation efforts.

AB  - Conservation translocations-the intentional movement of animals to restore populations-have increased over the past 30 years to halt and reverse species declines and losses. However, there are many challenges translocated animals face that should be considered for restoration programs to be successful. Understanding how long it takes for translocated animals to acclimate to these challenges and their new landscape is a critical component of post-release population management. Physiological measures such as hormone responses are increasingly used to assess animal responses and acclimation to disturbances including translocation. We determined the physiological acclimation period of elk (Cervus canadensis) translocated to the Missouri Ozarks, USA, as part of a restoration effort. From 2011 to 2013, we translocated 108 GPS-radio-collared elk from Kentucky, USA, to Missouri, USA, and collected faecal samples for glucocorticoid metabolite extraction to use as an indicator of physiological acclimation. We modelled the response of population-wide faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCMs) across the initial 9 years of the restoration in response to days following release and additional site-specific covariates. Presence of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) hunts and monthly precipitation levels were positively and negatively associated with fGCM levels, respectively. Concurrent with influences from site-specific conditions on the release landscape, fGCM levels declined following release. We identified a breakpoint in fGCM decline at similar to 42 days following translocation releases suggesting elk acclimated physiologically relatively quickly compared to other species. The fast physiological acclimation by Missouri elk suggests effective use of temporary post-release management efforts. Determining how quickly animals acclimate following translocations allows researchers to tailor post-release management plans to each species' needs, thus maximizing the success of future translocation efforts while minimizing costs.

AB  - The exclusion of grazing has been used extensively in alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau. Studies, however, have shown reported recent trends of decreasing concentrations of soil nutrients because of grazing exclusion and climate change. The effects of excluding grazing on the soil biogeochemical process of phosphorus cycling in alpine meadows are unclear, especially under climatic warming. We conducted a 5-year grazing-exclusion and warming-manipulation experiment to examine the effects of excluding grazing on fractions of soil phosphorus, microbial and nematode com-munities and enzymatic activities in treatments of low grazing intensity, grazing exclusion, and combined grazing exclusion and warming. Our results indicated that excluding grazing significantly decreased bacterivore and omnivore-predator densities, phoD gene abundance and alkaline phosphomonoesterase activity (in the 0-5 cm layer by -34, -41, -38 and -42 %) at altitudes of 3850 m, 4000 m, 4150 m and 4250 m, respectively. Structural equa-tion modeling indicated that bacterivores positively affected phoD gene abundance, alkaline phosphomonoesterase ac-tivity and inorganic-phosphorus fractions. Combined grazing exclusion and warming significantly decreased bacterivore and omnivore-predator densities but significantly increased fungivore density (in the 0-5 cm layer by 238, 172, 119 and 65 %) at altitudes of 3850, 4000, 4150 and 4250 m, respectively. Structural equation modeling also indicated that the combined grazing-exclusion and warming treatment increased the soil fungi and fungivores, but the higher abundances of fungi and fungivores did not significantly affect acid phosphomonoesterase activity or inorganic-phosphorus fractions. Alternatively, the combined grazing-exclusion and warming treatment significantly increased the concentrations of amorphous and free aluminum, which were positively correlated with the maximum adsorption of phosphorus. The combined grazing-exclusion and warming treatment thus significantly decreased the availability of resin phosphorus (-63, -51, -81 and -67 %) in the 0-5 cm layer at altitudes of 3850, 4000, 4150 and 4250 m, respectively. Our results suggested that light grazing (0.5 yak ha-1 year-1) could increase phospho-rus mineralization and the activity of soil enzymes in alpine meadows under global warming. An adequate load of live-stock pressure at each altitude can be an effective management technique, mainly under warming, to maintain an adequate, sustainable and equilibrated phosphorus cycle in the plant-soil system.

AB  - Freshwater megafish species, such as sturgeons, salmonids, carps, and catfishes, have a maximum reported weight >= 30 kg. Due to their charisma and economic value, they have been widely introduced outside of their native ranges. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the introduction of freshwater megafish and an assessment of their environmental impacts. Of the 134 extant freshwater megafish species, 46% have been introduced to new environments, and of these, 69% have established self-sustaining alien populations. These introductions affect 59% of the world's main basins, with the USA and western Europe being particular hotspots of megafish introductions. The common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is the most widely introduced species. Using the Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (EICAT and EICAT+) frameworks, we assessed the severity and type of negative and positive impacts posed by alien megafish on native species. Alien megafish caused negative impacts through nine different mechanisms, with predation being the most frequently reported mechanism, followed by herbivory and competition. Moreover, 58% of the alien megafish species with sufficient data to evaluate the severity of their impacts caused declining populations of native species, or worse, extirpations of native species populations. The positive environmental impacts of alien megafish were far less frequently documented. They include biotic interactions that benefit native species, and the provision of trophic resources or habitats. Widely introduced or extensively studied species are more likely to have documented severe impacts on native species. There is a clear trade-off between the economic benefits associated with megafish introductions and the severe adverse impacts they have on native biodiversity. Our study highlights the need for comprehensive risk assessments to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of megafish. More research and long-term monitoring schemes are required to inform management actions to protect biodiversity, particularly in the Global South.
   Of the 134 extant freshwater megafish species, 46% have been introduced outside of their native ranges. Over 50% of the alien megafish species with sufficient data to evaluate the severity of their environmental impacts have caused population declines or even extirpations of native species. More research and long-term monitoring schemes on alien species are required to inform management actions to protect biodiversity, particularly in the Global South.image

AB  - Litter decomposition is one of the largest carbon (C) fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems and links aboveground biomass to soil C pools. In grasslands, decomposition drivers have received substantial attention but the role of grassland herbivores in influencing decay rates is often ignored despite their potentially large effects on standing biomass and nutrient cycling. Recent work has demonstrated that nutrient addition increases early-stage decay and suppresses late-stage decay. Mammalian herbivores can mediate the effects of nutrient supply on biomass, suggesting herbivores may alter the effects of nutrients on decomposition, though this is largely unknown. We examined how herbivory mediates the effects of nutrient supply on long-term decomposition across 19 grassland sites of the Nutrient Network distributed experiment. At each site, a full-factorial experiment of combined nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and micronutrient (K) enrichment ('control' or ' + NPK') and mammalian herbivore (> similar to 50 g) exclusion ('unfenced' or 'fenced') was carried out in a randomized block design. We hypothesized that nutrient effects on litter decomposition would be strongest where herbivores caused the greatest reductions in aboveground plant biomass (i.e., at sites with more intense herbivory). After accounting for wide variation in decomposition rates across sites, we found that, within sites, elevated nutrients increased early-stage decay and suppressed late-stage decay. In contrast, neither herbivore exclusion (i.e., fencing) nor site level changes in aboveground biomass due to herbivory altered the nutrient effects on decomposition rates. Across grasslands, our results indicate that elevated nutrient supply modifies litter decomposition rates independent of herbivore impacts.

AB  - Mountain pine beetles (MPBs) pose a substantial threat to North American pine forests, causing extensive tree mortality over large areas. Their tree-killing ability is closely linked to mass aggregation on host trees triggered via pheromones and dependence on their symbiotic fungi. However, the influence of a changing climate on the biology of MPBs and their co-evolved interactions with their fungal symbionts remains uncertain. To investigate this, male and female pairs of beetles were introduced into freshly cut logs from lodgepole pine trees and placed in controlled climate chambers with manipulated environmental conditions, including two levels of CO2 (ambient vs. 1000 ppm), O3 (ambient vs. 100 ppb) and humidity (33% vs. 65%). The beetle-infested logs were left in these chambers for 1 month and then returned to ambient conditions until brood emergence. Emerging broods were collected for further analysis. Additionally, three species of fungal symbionts (Grosmannia clavigera, Ophiostoma montium and Leptographium longiclavatum) were subjected to the same CO2, O3 and humidity conditions for 5 days. Lower humidity promoted MPB reproduction and fungal growth. Elevated CO2 accelerated larval growth and emergence while improving brood pheromone production. Elevated O3 had a negative impact on MPB reproduction and brood fitness while improving its immune responses to an entomopathogenic fungus (Beauveria bassiana). It also inhibited fungal growth and reproduction, whereas elevated CO2 had varied (positive or negative) effects on fungal growth and ergosterol (proxy to fungal mass) production depending on the fungal species. Together, these findings suggest that climate change can potentially alter the interactions between MPBs and their fungal symbionts, highlighting the importance of understanding how climate change affects forest pests and their symbiotic relationships to develop effective management strategies in the future.
   Mountain pine beetles threaten North American pine forests by causing widespread tree mortality through mass aggregation on host trees. The current study demonstrates exposed beetle-fungal symbiont pairs to manipulated CO2, O3 and humidity levels, finding that lower humidity favoured beetle reproduction and fungal growth, while elevated CO2 accelerated beetle larval growth and emergence. Elevated O3 negatively impacted beetle reproduction but boosted immune responses against a fungal pathogen. These findings underscore the need to understand climate change's impact on forest pests and their symbiotic relationships for effective future management strategies.image

AB  - Observations of Black Spot Syndrome (BSS), a pigmented dermatopathy in marine fishes, have been increasingly reported in important grazers such as surgeonfish and parrotfish in the Caribbean. This condition has been linked to infection by the trematode parasite, Scaphanocephalus spp., although relatively little is known about the environmental drivers of infection and how they vary spatially. This study introduces a non-invasive, video-based method to survey BSS presence and severity in ocean surgeonfish (Acanthurus tractus). Application of the approach across 35 coastal sites in Curacao was used to evaluate the influence of environmental factors on BSS, including longitude, herbivorous fish density, wave energy, depth, nutrient pollution, and inhabited surface area. Of the 5123 fish surveyed between February 2022 and January 2023, 70% exhibited visible signs of BSS, and the average number of lesions per fish increased by similar to fivefold from eastern to western sites along the leeward coastline. Within a site, estimates of BSS severity were broadly consistent between different divers, different reviewers of video footage, and the date of sampling, emphasizing the robustness of the surveillance approach. Analyses of environmental factors indicated that BSS decreased with wave intensity while increasing in association with higher nutrient runoff and fishing pressure. This study provides insight into environmental correlates of BSS severity while highlighting the use of video-based surveillance as a non-invasive survey method. The mechanisms linking environmental factors with BSS as well as its consequences for affected fish remain unknown, emphasizing the need for long-term and experimental studies in this system.

AB  - Uncertain chronology and data scarcity have impeded realistic reconstructions of megafauna extinctions in the Late Pleistocene in several key regions of the Northern Hemisphere such as Beringia. This region was a refuge for several plants, animals during the extremely cold period of the Late Pleistocene in high Arctic latitudes. The woolly rhinoceros was one of the most widespread members of the megafauna in the Asiatic part of the region (West Beringia) between similar to 60 and 14 cal ka BP. This study is based on statistical analyses of 20 newly obtained and 110 previously published radiocarbon dates. We found three large "waves" in the woolly rhinoceros range changes separated between themselves by the cold climatic Heinrich events (H2 and H4). The chronology of the woolly rhinoceros was overlaid on data of environmental changes obtained basing on 504 generalized early published pollen spectra throughout the species range and, separately, outside the range - in the east of the West Beringia realm and in East Beringia. In general, milder environmental conditions of MIS3 (57-29 ka BP) were more favourable for the woolly rhinoceros than the harsh conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum (similar to 29-15 cal ka BP) in MIS2. We have concluded that the feed base was unlikely the main limiting factor in the distribution of woolly rhinoceros in Western Beringia, and other ecological factors (temperature/precipitation) determined the species range and its oscillation over the MIS3-MIS2 stages. Based on summarizing available data and this research, we have proposed that there were sets of different reasons that prevented the woolly rhinoceros migration to the east of Beringia in different periods of the Late Pleistocene. Abrupt woolly rhinoceros extinction in Beringia between 15 and 14 cal ka BP coincided with the Bolling warming and the Older Dryas cooling. The ecological situation just before the extinction, associated with climate warming, moisture increasing and shrub tundra expansion in West Beringia, was qualitatively different from previous cases of the species range degradations in the second half of the Late Pleistocene. This multi-proxy study of woolly rhinoceros chronology provide a new basis for further understanding of its population history, demography, and biology in Beringia before its extinction.

AB  - IntroductionPlant functional traits (FTs) are important for understanding plant ecological strategies (e.g., drought avoidance), especially in the nutrient-poor soils of serpentine ecosystems. In the Mediterranean areas, such ecosystems are characterized by climatic factors (e.g., summer drought) that exert a filtering effect. Material and MethodsIn our study, we analyzed 24 species with varying serpentine affinity, from strictly serpentine plants to generalist plants, from two ultramafic shrublands in southern Spain, considering four FTs: plant height (H), leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), and stem specific density (SSD). Additionally, we also identified the species' dominant strategies to avoid drought and those strategies' relationship to serpentine affinity. We used principal component analysis to identify combinations of FTs, and cluster analysis to define Functional Groups (FGs). Results and DiscussionWe defined eight FGs, which suggests that such Mediterranean serpentine shrublands are composed of species with wide-ranging of FTs. Indicator traits explained 67-72% of the variability based on four strategies: (1) lower H than in other Mediterranean ecosystems; (2) middling SSD; (3) low LA; and (4) low SLA due to thick and/or dense leaves, which contribute to long leaf survival, nutrient retention, and protection from desiccation and herbivory. Generalist plants had higher SLA than obligate serpentine plants, whereas the obligate serpentine plants showed more drought avoidance mechanisms than the generalists. Although most plant species inhabiting Mediterranean serpentine ecosystems have shown similar ecological adaptations in response to the Mediterranean environment, our results suggest that serpentine obligate plant species could present greater resilience to climate change. Given greater number and more pronounced drought avoidance mechanisms in these species compared with generalists, and the high number of FGs identified, the serpentine plants have shown adaptation to severe drought.

AB  - Mutualistic interactions between species underpin biodiversity and ecosystem function, but may be lost when partners respond differently to abiotic conditions. Except for a few prominent examples, effects of global anthropogenic change on mutualisms are poorly understood. Here we assess the effects of urbanization on a symbiosis in which the plant Cordia nodosa house ants in hollow structures (domatia) in exchange for defense against herbivores. We expected to find that mutualist ants would be replaced in the city by heat-tolerant opportunists, leaving urban plants vulnerable to herbivory. In five protected forest sites and five urban forest fragments in southeast Per & uacute;, we recorded the identity and heat tolerance (CTmax) of ant residents of C. nodosa. We also assayed their plant-defensive behaviors and their effects on herbivory. We characterized the urban heat-island effect in ambient temperatures and within domatia. Forest plants housed a consistent ant community dominated by three specialized plant ants, whereas urban plants housed a suite of 10 opportunistic taxa that were, collectively, about 13 times less likely than forest ants to respond defensively to plant disturbance. In the forest, ant exclusion had the expected effect of increasing herbivory, but in urban sites, exclusion reduced herbivory. Despite poor ant defense in urban sites, we detected no difference in total standing herbivory, perhaps because herbivores themselves also declined in the city. Urban sites were warmer than forest sites (daily maxima in urban domatia averaged 1.6 degrees C hotter), and the urban ant community as a whole was slightly more heat tolerant. These results illustrate a case of mutualism loss associated with anthropogenic disturbance. If urbanization is representative of increasing anthropogenic stressors more broadly, we might expect to see destabilization of myrmecophytic mutualisms in forest ecosystems in the future.

AB  - Climatic factors drive changes in forage fish communities and may influence the productivity of piscivorous predators, but specific mechanisms of response remain poorly known. Between 1984 and 2020, we studied the rhinoceros auklet Cerorhinca monocerata, a seabird breeding in the western North Pacific at Teuri Island, Japan. We tested the hypothesis that climate-mediated prey-switching affects 'food packaging' (i.e. the way energy is brought to dependent offspring) and breeding success by quantifying relationships between climate, prey energy density, amount of food delivered, and the growth and survival of chicks. Prey composition switched 4 times: 1988-1992, 1997-1998, 2013-2014, and 2017-2018. All but the last of these switches were associated with (lagged) shifts in seawater temperature/Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Rhinoceros auklets brought multiple fish in each meal-load to chicks, and numbers were inversely correlated with the size of the fish. These relationships varied between fish species. The heaviest meal-loads were achieved when diets were dominated by anchovy Engraulis japonicas, which occurred during warm phases (1992-2013). Chick production, growth rates, and mass at fledgling were also highest during the warm phases. This study shows that climate affects seabird reproduction by shifting the manner in which food is selected relative to changes in forage fish community structure and abundance.

AB  - Fences can act as impermeable or semipermeable barriers to animal movement, which can reduce habitat connectivity, carrying capacity, and gene flow. Portions of standard height fence (1.4-1.5 m) and water gaps (fencing to allow water to flow through while controlling animal movement) can offset the potential negative effects of impermeable fences on wildlife by facilitating movement across the boundary. However, little is known regarding the frequency, distance, duration, and timing of deer crossing events. Therefore, we quantified the effects of temporary water gaps and sections of standard fencing on and activity patterns on a property fenced with 2.4-m tall chain link fence topped with 3 barbed wire strands. We captured and fitted 169 deer (80 F, 89 M) with GPS collars that collected 1 location every 15 or 30 minutes from 2011 to 2015. We used k-means cluster analysis to identify crossing locations post-hoc and then calculated the number of crossovers (non-returning forays) and crossover loops (completed loops), maximum distance outside of the property boundary, total distance traveled, crossing time, and time duration outside the fence for each deer. Twenty-seven deer (11 females, 16 males) left the property 340 times through 5 water gaps and an similar to 500-m section of 1.4-1.5-m high 5-strand barbed wire. Twenty-six deer made 333 return trips; however, the 7 non-return events were due to dropped collars (n = 6) and one non-hunting related mortality while outside of the fence. Most crossings were crepuscular, consistent with normal deer movement patterns. Mean maximum distance and duration of crossover loops outside the fence was 705 m and 23.6 h, respectively. Results suggest that temporary water gaps and standard height fencing can facilitate fence crossings by deer while maintaining population fidelity to the property; the 2.4-m tall fence also was an effective security barrier for the property by restricting access to the site. Landowners willing to allow cross-fence movement will need to determine the allowable percentage of animals that may cross, which is dependent on management goals and dictates the type, amount, and location of crossings.

AB  - Alpine ecosystems are vulnerable to the warming climate, yet alpine soil mesofauna remains the less studied part of NZ biodiversity. Here we present a survey of soil mesofauna communities of three mountain peaks in the Nelson-Tasman and Marlborough regions of the South Island of New Zealand. We assessed changes in abundance, diversity and trophic composition along the elevational gradient from subalpine forests to alpine herb fields (800-1600 m a.s.l.) and analysed the influence of selected environmental factors on mesofauna. Taxon richness was expected to decrease and the proportion of predators to increase in alpine habitats, as has been observed elsewhere. Sub-alpine beech forests harboured a high diversity of soil mesofauna, many of which are Gondwanan relics. There was a decline in abundance and taxonomic richness of mesofauna with increasing elevation. However, no proportional increase in predators with increasing elevation was seen - alpine mesofauna assemblages had lower predator-to-herbivore ratios than upland forests. Several interesting taxa - harpacticoid copepods, moss bugs (Hemiptera: Peloridiidae), unique-headed bugs (Hemiptera: Enicocephalomorpha), micro-spiders, mite harvestmen, Neelidae springtails and acarifauna are discussed in more detail. Baseline data such as these advance the knowledge of native fauna and provide a baseline for ecological monitoring in the alpine zone.

AB  - Climate change and human activities have disrupted historical fire regimes, leading to complex and far-reaching impacts on global ecosystems. Despite extensive research in fire ecology, studies exploring vertebrate responses to megafires, and to nuanced fire characteristics, remain limited.We collected camera trap data 3-27 months following Australia's 2019-20 'Black Summer' megafires from 30 burnt sites and 10 unburnt sites. Our data included 14 animal species/groups, encompassing mammalian predators, small and medium-sized mammals, large herbivores, and birds. We used generalised additive mixed models to assess the influence of time-since-the-fires, burn status, fire severity, proportional area burnt, and vegetation type on species' activity.Models that included fire variables were well-supported for all species. The proportional cover of low-moderate or high-extreme severity fire had substantial support for five species, particularly herbivores, which generally showed a preference for burnt sites but at differing fire severities. The proportional area burnt, disregarding severity, was well supported for four species. At highly burned sites fox activity peaked shortly after the fires while small to medium-sized mammal activity increased more gradually. Vegetation type strongly influenced the response of four species to fire; in particular, wet forest birds preferred unburnt areas.Policy implications. We document variable short- to medium-term responses of a range of species to fire which could help guide management interventions. We demonstrate that animal species' responses to fire are diverse and better captured using broader landscape scale fire variables. We found that species were strongly influenced by proportional area burnt, fire severity and vegetation type. Introduced foxes were attracted to recently burnt areas, so timely predator control may benefit vulnerable prey species. Wet forest species were sensitive to fires and could benefit from preservation and restoration of these habitats. Some species exploited low-moderate severity burnt areas, while others preferred high-severity burns. This suggests that species will face diverse challenges and opportunities in future extreme fire events. We emphasise the importance of using multi-faceted approaches to account for the complex responses of co-occurring species to fire events.

AB  - Aposematic species rely on primary and secondary antipredator strategies. Yet, some opportunistic and generalist species may consume them, although this has been largely supported by indirect evidence such as dietary analyses or clay model experiments. Here, we studied the role of the wild boar, Sus scrofa, as a consumer and possible predator of an aposematic and toxic salamander, Salamandra salamandra gallaica. We investigated this behaviour using camera traps and salamander carcasses on a small island where both species co-occur. Our results show a very low proportion of salamanders consumed by wild boars (3.8%), which indicates that fire salamanders might not completely rely on their aposematic strategy to avoid being consumed by this generalist species. The number of predation events does not differ between wild boar age classes, but it does between seasons, with a higher consumption in spring, which can be associated with an increase in animal consumption when fruits (e.g., acorns) are no longer available on this island. We also highlight the need for temporal studies targeting predator-prey interactions through behavioural data and complementary approaches to better understand the possible impact of opportunistic and generalist species in the ecosystem. This is particularly important in management plans involving the control of generalist species such as the wild boar, which is considered one of the most invasive species globally and a threat to countless species worldwide.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) is a serious threat to communities living proximal to wildlife areas. Under-standing the attitudes of local communities toward HWC management is critical for planning and designing effective and sustainable mitigation strategies. Here we used quasi-structured questionnaires to assess local community attitudes toward the electrified fencing installed in the Western Corridor of the Serengeti Ecosystem to mitigate human-elephant conflict (HEC). We found that most of the respondents agreed that the installed electrified fence effectively mitigates HEC. In addition, fencing has been perceived as effective in controlling problematic or dangerous animals other than elephants, and therefore increasing harvest yields, improving the physical security of farms and properties, minimizing illegal hunting, and reducing interaction between domestic and wild animals. Furthermore, the local people in the surveyed area expect that human-wildlife coexistence will improve after the fence installation. As the area is famously known for the annual great wildebeest migration, we recommend further studies on the ecological impacts of the installed fence.

AB  - Fencing wildlife populations can aid wildlife management goals, but potential benefits may not always outweigh costs of confinement. Population isolation can erode genetic diversity and lead to the accumulation of inbreeding, reducing viability and limiting adaptive potential. We used microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA data collected from 640 white-tailed deer confined within a 1184 ha fence to quantify changes in genetic diversity and inbreeding over the first 12 years of confinement. Genetic diversity was sustained over the course of the study, remaining comparable to unconfined white-tailed deer populations. Uneroded genetic diversity suggests that genetic drift is mitigated by a low level of gene flow, which supports field observations that the fence is not completely impermeable. In year 9 of the study, we observed an unexpected influx of mtDNA diversity and drop in inbreeding as measured by F-IS. A male harvest restriction imposed that year increased male survival, and more diverse mating may have contributed to the inbreeding reduction and temporary genetic diversity boost we observed. These data add to our understanding of the long-term impacts of fences on wildlife, but also highlight the importance of continued monitoring of confined populations.

AB  - Tree shelters are effective in enhancing early survival and growth and protecting planted seedlings against herbivory by mammals; they are, however, expensive. In order to be cost-effective, we need to employ silvicultural practices that maximize the benefits of using tree shelters. Thus, this study examined whether tree shelter effects on early seedling growth are enhanced by the combination of large stock and vegetation control, based on a three factor split-plot experiment for the first three years after planting the seedlings out in a fenced plantation of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica). Vegetation control involved spot and strip weeding to reduce labor costs. The experiment demonstrated the great effect of tree shelters on enhancing the early height growth of seedlings. At the end of the third growing season, sheltered seedlings were 1.5 times taller than unsheltered seedlings on average, and approximately two-thirds of sheltered seedlings had exceeded the browsing height of deer, while unsheltered seedlings had not. Using large stock and employing vegetation control also positively affected seedling height. However, combining these treatments with tree shelters intensified the positive effects on seedling height, and shortened the period during which the leader shoots of seedlings would be unprotected from the browsing without fencing. The present study thus reveals that the combination of tree shelters, large stock and vegetation control is effective in maximizing the benefit of tree shelter installation.

AB  - The introduction of non-native species has led to an increase in co-occurring species in shared habitats, particularly in aquatic ecosystems. This study aimed to elucidate how biological control agents modulate the interspecific competition between the invasive plant species Eichhornia crassipes and Alternanthera philoxeroides while also assessing the impact of their respective biocontrol agents, Neochetina eichhorniae and Agasicles hygrophila. Under controlled conditions, a 60-day experiment was conducted in which the growth, defoliation, relative growth rates, and root-to-shoot ratios of the two species in both monoculture and mixed culture were evaluated in the presence and absence of their biological control agents. The results indicate that E. crassipes consistently outperformed A. philoxeroides in growth under all of the tested treatment conditions, exhibiting greater biomass and higher relative growth rates in monocultures than in mixed cultures (p < 0.05). Defoliation of E. crassipes and A. philoxeroides increased significantly under herbivory (p < 0.05). Pathway analysis revealed that biological control agents had a pronounced negative effect on A. philoxeroides (the standardized path coefficients: - 0.93, p < 0.05), whereas interspecific competition was the most significant factor that suppressed E. crassipes (the standardized path coefficients: - 0.73, p > 0.05). These findings suggest that when biological control agents are present, E. crassipes is likely to gradually dominate and to displace A. philoxeroides within shared habitats. Mechanical removal of E. crassipes may be necessary in the short term, while the development and introduction of additional biocontrol agents could provide a more sustainable solution in the long term. The insights gained from this research provide a scientific basis for developing more effective management strategies to control the invasion of E. crassipes and A. philoxeroides in the riparian and wetland regions of southern China, where the two invasive species and their biological control agents frequently co-occur. Specifically, in addition to mechanical removal, the introduction, development, and enhancement of biological control agents are crucial for the effective restoration of native aquatic ecosystems compromised by multiple invasive species.

AB  - Extensive deer browsing threatens the ability of many forests in the northeastern United States to regenerate and sustain their biodiversity. To reliably assess whether deer are reducing the regeneration of key tree species valued for timber and wildlife, we developed a rapid field protocol for Assessing Vegetation Impacts from Deer (AVID, http://AVIDdeer.com). AVID is a method for foresters, landowners, volunteers, and others to measure the effect of deer browsing on seedling growth. Our objectives were to: 1. Determine if the AVID method could detect differences in growth rates for protected (fenced) and unprotected seedlings, 2. Evaluate AVID's usefulness as a regeneration monitoring tool for citizen-science engagement, and 3. Compare and contrast the relative strengths and weaknesses of common methods for measuring deer impacts to vegetation. We compared fenced and un-fenced plots at 10 research sites in New York State to validate the sensitivity of AVID for detecting deer impacts to seedling growth. Tagged seedlings were measured annually for height growth in replicated plots. Deer reduced average seedling height growth of palatable species several fold at these sites often in combination with the effects of site and year. From 2016 through 2020, we conducted 59 AVID training events with 1,399 participants including landowners, students, educators, naturalists, resource management professionals, and land trust staff. Volunteers established plots at 83 sites in 24 New York counties demonstrating that AVID provides a valued citizen-science approach for both teaching people and assessing deer impacts to forest regeneration. Once vol-unteers consistently monitor a statistically valid number of plots for several years, the New York's Department of Environmental Conservation intends to use AVID data to inform deer management decisions.

AB  - Being opportunistic omnivores, wild pigs (Sus scrofa) readily feed on edible garbage. Given the presence of substantial volumes of edible food waste, large multi-county and regional municipal sanitary waste landfills constitute attractive forage resources for pigs, providing a year-round anthropogenic source of potentially high-quality forage. Our objective was to assess the effects that a large regional landfill has on the local pigs foraging in that facility's waste disposal cells. The landfill, located on the United States Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina, USA, became operational in 1998 and pigs began foraging there in 2001. By 2009 >100 pigs/night were observed foraging in the landfill, suggesting landfill establishment may have important consequences for population dynamics, public safety, and disease transmission. We evaluated changes in body mass, fetal litter size, numbers of pigs removed, and wild pig-vehicle collisions (WPVCs) before (1980-2000) and after (2001-2019) pigs began foraging in the landfill on SRS. Body mass during the after period increased to a greater extent for pigs in the vicinity of the landfill compared to pigs on the rest of SRS. Fetal litter size increased for pigs in the vicinity of the landfill, whereas it remained unchanged on the rest of SRS. Our density surrogate (number of pigs harvested) increased around the landfill during the after period by 2.9 times, whereas on the rest of the site it only increased by 53%. No WPVCs occurred adjacent to the landfill before 2001, but WPVCs increased along the 2 major roads bordering the landfill after 2001. Effects of sanitary waste landfills on wild pig populations scavenging there can present unique challenges to population management, control, public safety, and disease transmission. Potential approaches to address these challenges could be exclusion fencing to prevent access to the landfill's waste disposal cells or enhanced placement of waste cell covers to reduce access.

AB  - Tropical freshwater wetlands are subject to multiple stressors but there is little information on which stressors cause wetland degradation. Increased turbidity is considered a major cause of degradation, but the effects of introduced fish are often overlooked. Tilapia are frequently introduced in tropical regions, especially species in the genus Oreochromis, and the ecological effects of introducing tilapia are poorly studied. We used enclosure experiments in a shallow lake in Madagascar to assess the effects of tilapia and turbidity on macrophytes and benthic invertebrates, and to test management interventions designed to increase both. Tilapia at high and low stocking densities had negative effects on survival of Charophyte algae and water lilies, but no direct effect on benthic invertebrate abundance or diversity. Invertebrate abundance was highest on submerged Charophytes, so herbivory by tilapia indirectly affected invertebrates. Turbidity affected Charophyte survival, and abundance and diversity of non-Dipteran insects. As a complication, tilapia may increase turbidity by re-suspending the lake sediment. Our results suggest that herbivory by tilapia is a plausible cause of the removal of macrophytes from the lake and an impediment to their re-establishment. Tilapia are widely introduced in tropical areas as a food resource. Our results demonstrate serious consequences to these introductions.

AB  - The Sardinian population of wild boar (WB, Sus scrofa meridionalis) has evolved on this Mediterranean island since its arrival in Neolithic age. Climate and land use vary across the island; high temperatures and dryness represent limiting factors for the development and reproduction of the species. Hence, the environment can have contributed to create the morphological differences we observe today across the island and could sustain the genetic structure that has been previously observed using neutral molecular markers. We therefore searched for genomic signatures of local adaptation in a sample of Sardinian WB genotyped at almost 50 K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genetic structure was observed in the population separating the northwest and southwest from the east of the island, where internal substructure also emerged. We identified 49 SNPs as candidate loci involved in adaptation and 61 genes. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed over-representation of terms related to cell localization, motility, and adhesion, but also related to anatomical development and immunity. According to our results, the environment seems to have played a role in shaping the genetic differentiation of the Sardinian wild boar in a limited evolutionary timescale.

AB  - Despite the popularity of translocation for conservation, many wildlife translocations fail. Research on translocation failure has most often focused on negative species interactions like competition or predation, but positive interactions such as facilitation may be just as important. Ecosystem engineers, including burrowing rodents, play a key role in maintaining high levels of biodiversity and could be used to improve translocation outcomes. However, ecosystem engineers might simultaneously facilitate and compete with translocated species. We used a natural experiment to assess translocation outcomes with a soft release for the threatened San Joaquin antelope squirrel (Ammospermophilus nelsoni) at a site with and without giant kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ingens)-an endangered species and ecosystem engineer. We further compared these outcomes to a control, non-translocated population of antelope squirrels. Survival was highest at the control site, lower at the site with giant kangaroo rats present, and lowest at the site with no giant kangaroo rats. In the year following translocation, we found evidence of reproduction at all three sites. After four years, the antelope squirrel population re-introduced to the kangaroo rat present site persisted, but the population at the kangaroo rat absent site appears to have failed. Home range sizes were much larger at the translocation sites compared to the control. Antelope squirrels dispersed farther from initial release at the site with giant kangaroo rats than the site without, but these results may have suffered from survivorship bias-that is, squirrels at the kangaroo rat absent site either stayed directly within the release footprint or dispersed so far that we could not find them. Our results suggest that the positive impacts of a burrowing ecosystem engineer outweigh the potential negative impacts from competition.

AB  - The decomposition of carcasses by scavengers and microbial decomposers is an important component of the biochemical cycle that can strongly alter the chemical composition of soils locally. Different scavenger guilds are assumed to have a different influence on the chemical elements that leak into the soil, although this assumption has not been empirically tested. Here, we experimentally determine how different guilds of vertebrate scavengers influence local nutrient dynamics. We performed a field experiment in which we systematically excluded different subsets of vertebrate scavengers from decomposing carcasses of fallow deer (Dama dama), and compared elemental concentrations in the soil beneath and in the vegetation next to the carcasses over time throughout the decomposition process. We used four exclusion treatments: excluding (1) no scavengers, thus allowing them all; (2) wild boar (Sus scrofa); (3) all mammals; and (4) all mammals and birds. We found that fluxes of several elements into the soil showed distinct peaks when all vertebrates were excluded. Especially, trace elements (Cu and Zn) seemed to be influenced by carcass decomposition. However, we found no differences in fluxes between partial exclusion treatments. Thus, vertebrate scavengers indeed reduce leakage of elements from carcasses into the soil, hence influencing local biochemical cycles, but did so independent of which vertebrate scavenger guild had access. Our results suggest that carcass-derived elements are dispersed over larger areas rather than locally leak into the soil when vertebrate scavengers dominate the decomposition process.

AB  - Floodplain forests provide a highly suitable environment for wild boar, especially because they offer a sufficient quantity of good-quality food across the seasons. Combined with year-round additional feeding and treatment, wild boar enjoy ideal living conditions in floodplain forests, which should have a positive effect on reproduction and, in turn, an increase in population. We expected the high carrying capacity of the floodplain forest environment to be reflected in young boar showing greater body weight and have a higher layer of subcutaneous fat, young females being in their first heat earlier, and females of all ages having more young. This was verified on a sample of wild boar females collected in Czechia's largest floodplain forest, which extends above the confluence of the Morava and Dyje Rivers and which is fenced off and used for breeding hoofed ruminant mammals. In addition to determining body characteristics and examining reproductive tracts, food quality was also analysed based on an analysis of stomach contents. Body and reproductive characteristics were compared with available data for the South Moravia. It has been confirmed that, in the floodplain forest, wild boar have a sufficient quantity of good-quality food all year round, yet they reach a smaller body size across all age classes. Piglets ovulated more eggs, while in contrast older females ovulated fewer. That is also why they gave birth to fewer piglets per litter. Wild boar in the floodplain forest gave birth later, with a birthing peak in May-June. This delay can be explained by the adaptation of wild boar populations in floodplain forests to the annual floods that come in March. We estimate that wild boar are able to respond flexibly not only to the food conditions of their environment, but also to the risk of possible mortality and other significant stressors, and to adapt their reproductive strategy accordingly.

AB  - Context. Bennett's wallaby (Notamacropus rufogriseus) was introduced into New Zealand in the late-1800s, and has subsequently become a significant pest to agriculture, silviculture, and native vegetation. Effective management of wallabies requires robust spatial and temporal ecological information, which can be used operationally to increase detection and kill rates. Aims. To determine home range size and shape, resource (i.e. habitat and topography) selection, and daily movement patterns of three populations of Bennett's wallaby in the South Island. Methods. We attached GPS-collars to 38 adult wallabies (17 females, 21 males) between May 2018 and May 2019, and obtained usable location data from 30 individuals. We used kernel density estimators and resource selection functions to quantify seasonal home ranges and resource selection, respectively. Key results. The mean seasonal home range sizes of males and females were similar (26.8 ha and 24.8 ha, respectively; combined range = 1.2-101.9 ha), although the largest home ranges belonged to large males. Resource selection was strongly influenced by distance to concealment cover, ridgelines and streams, i.e. wallabies selected to be closer to these features, though not necessarily at them. Wallabies selected areas close to concealment cover throughout 24-h periods, but most strongly during the day, which is when they bed in dense cover. Wallabies sampled outside of peak breeding moved most during dusk and dawn (median =similar to 50 m/h), whereas those sampled during peak breeding moved widely during day, dusk, and night (110-280 m/h), but not dawn (median =similar to 50 m/h). Conclusions. The home range sizes of wallabies in New Zealand were highly variable, but on average were similar for males and females. Wallabies selected pasture close to areas with some cover, suggesting a trade-off between access to high-quality forage and concealment cover. Implications. Our results provide robust data for modelling management strategies for wallabies, and contribute directly to operational planning by identifying habitats where wallabies are most likely to be found temporally. This information can be used to determine the appropriate survey methods and control tools to maximise detection rates and kill rates of wallabies, based on habitat.

AB  - Syngnathids are vulnerable fishes closely associated with seaweeds and seagrass, which provide shelter and food resources. Even though most syngnathids commonly feed on small crustaceans, the feeding regimes may differ depending on the species and prey availability. This is the first monitoring study to explain syngnathid abundances and dietary regimes within macroalgal beds in Cies Archipelago (Atlantic Islands Marine National Park, North West Iberian Peninsula). We sampled the epifaunal assemblages in seaweed communities dominated by the canopy-forming macroalgae Gongolaria baccata and Codium spp. seasonally during 2 years. The epifaunal structure was mostly represented by harpacticoid copepods, amphipods (especially gammarids) and gastropods. Epifauna exhibited low plant-host specificity and a higher dominance of amphipods on the more structurally complex macroalgae G. baccata. The epifaunal assemblages and syngnathid specimens were assessed for trophic structure using stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15). The three syngnathids (Hippocampus guttulatus, Syngnathus acus, and Entelurus aequoreus) inhabiting Cies Archipelago were sympatric. They occupied highly similar trophic positions (TPs), but differed in niche size, in such a way that the snake pipefish E. aequoreus would likely feed on smaller prey. The assessment of the feeding regime in the dominant great pipefish S. acus revealed that amphipods mostly contributed to bulk diet, followed by isopods, carideans, and copepods, whereas mysidaceans were not highly consumed. Seasonal changes in both epifaunal structure and syngnathids abundance confirmed that syngnathids are seasonal residents in Cies Archipelago, migrating to other areas in autumn when the seaweed cover is drastically reduced and the epifaunal structure modified. This study showed the importance of Gongolaria assemblages in Cies Archipelago, providing rich dietary sources and potentially contributing to higher abundances and diversity of syngnathids. Ongoing cover reduction in Gongolaria assemblages in certain regions (e.g., Mediterranean) should be considered a potential ecological concern for syngnathids and accompanying fauna, requiring further investigations.

AB  - Since parrotfish in coral reefs are involved in key ecological processes, this study compiled species presence-absence data across 51 sites in the South China Sea to identify and explore the distribution and relationship between species and large-scale factors. A total of 50 species of parrotfish were recorded during the compilation, of which Scarus ghobban Forsskal, 1775 was the most common and widespread. The Nansha Islands, having a vast area of coral reefs and great proximity away from human interference, had the highest abundance with 41 species. Nestedness analysis indicated that the parrotfish community had statistically significant nested patterns in the South China Sea, and the Nansha Islands were the topmost site for the nested matrix rank. Scleractinian coral species richness and log(reef area) both had a significant effect on the site nested matrix rank (p < 0.05), which supports the habitat nestedness hypothesis in the South China Sea. Compared with browsers and excavators, scrapers were determined to be the most important functional group composition, while browsers had a greater contribution to the species nested matrix rank. A linear regression model showed that parrotfish species' richness increased with increasing longitude, scleractinian coral species richness, and reef area. Longitudinal variations in the parrotfish species richness were related to its distance from the biodiversity hotspot in the Indo-Australian Archipelago. Parrotfish were mainly distributed in the temperature range of 26-29 degrees C, similar to the optimum temperature for coral growth. The Nansha Islands should be considered biodiversity conservation priority areas for the conservation of parrotfish in degraded coral reef habitats, particularly in the context of increasing natural variability and anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - Salt cedar (Tamarix spp. L), is found across Texas and the western United States, primarily near riparian areas. Introduced in the 1800s as an ornamental plant, salt cedar escaped domestic gardens, invading native rangelands. Mechanical and chemical control options for salt cedar are available, but effective control can be difficult and cost prohibitive. Sheep and goats will readily consume salt cedar after exposure at weaning, and goats readily consume the plant when released on rangelands. Unfortunately, sheep and goats are not a viable option in many areas due to predation or lack of appropriate fencing. The objectives of this study were to determine if cattle would consume salt cedar at a similar level (body weight basis) as sheep and goats and to determine if preconditioning improved acceptance of salt cedar by cattle. Angus-Hereford cross heifers (n = 15), Rambouillet lambs (n = 15), and Boer-Spanish cross kids (n = 15) were placed in individual pens for 21 d and fed salt cedar leaves and tender stems daily. For the first 21 d, eight head from each species were fed a basal diet and salt cedar while 7 head only received the basal diet. The amount of salt cedar in the diet was increased from 5% of the diet to 10% of the diet after 7 d of feeding and fed until d 21. From d 22 to 28 both naive and familiar animals were fed salt cedar daily. All animals readily increased intake of salt cedar. By d 7, cattle, sheep, and goats consumed the plant, but intake varied daily for cattle and sheep. After the first 7 d, goats consistently ate more (P < 0.05) salt cedar than cattle or sheep. While goats may consume more salt cedar, cattle may be a viable option to reduce salt cedar cover when goats are not a viable option. (C) 2021 The Society for Range Management.

AB  - In semiarid regions, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) is a major small mammal species occupying perennial grassland habitats that include old-fields, native bunchgrass-sagebrush, and some agricultural settings. We investigated population changes in deer mouse populations in perennial grasslands, both natural and old-field, from 1982 to 2003 in southern British Columbia, Canada. Hypotheses (H) predicted that P. maniculatus populations will have (H-1) multiannual fluctuations in abundance driven by population increases from extended breeding in summer and winter; (H-2) relaxed spring reorganization events in some years leading to higher overall recruitment and survival; and (H-3) interspecific competition with montane voles that causes deer mice to be lower in density when voles are higher. P. maniculatus populations in old-field and grass-sagebrush sites had clearly defined periods of high "peak" mean numbers (32-52/ha) and other times of low mean numbers (20-22/ha). Based on mean annual peak density in autumn, deer mouse populations exhibited fluctuations of 3-4 years in both habitats, but this pattern was not always present. The greater numbers of P. maniculatus in high than low years was directly related to population increases from extended breeding seasons and an increased number of lactating females, thereby supporting H-1. Spring breeding season declines occurred but were similar or less in high than low years of mean abundance and were relaxed in comparison to forest populations of deer mice in other studies. Thus, H-2 was supported for recruitment with high numbers of young-of-the-year breeding and total number of juvenile recruits but for survival was equivocal. Total summer survival was consistently higher in high than low population years but juvenile productivity in all years was poor. Mean abundance of P. maniculatus and M. montanus in old-field sites were highly correlated, and hence H-3 was not supported. This latter result is the first, to our knowledge, of P. maniculatus coexisting in a similar pattern of population fluctuations with a Microtus species in a mainland grassland habitat. Higher than average precipitation in the year preceding a peak population of deer mice may have enhanced herbaceous vegetation and contributed to population increases in both habitats. We conclude that the old-field habitat associated with this agricultural setting provides optimum habitat for P. maniculatus and facilitates multiannual population fluctuations in this species.

AB  - The 1983 die-off of the long-spined sea urchin Diadema antillarum was linked to dramatic increases in macroalgal biomass and abundance on Caribbean coral reefs. D. antillarum densities have only recently begun to recover, and on some reefs this has led to a decrease in algae and an increase in coral recruits. Given the historic importance of this herbivore and the patchiness of its distribution on modern Caribbean reefs, a better understanding of its feeding preferences for different macroalgae is fundamental to reef ecology and management. This study investigated the feeding preferences of D. antillarum for different macroalgae and benthic cyanobacteria that were most common at our study sites on reefs of the U.S. Virgin Islands, although most of these algae occur throughout the Caribbean. Many of these algae are chemically rich, and some are known to be chemically defended against generalist grazers. Previous studies have suggested that D. antillarum has a greater capacity than herbivorous fishes and other herbivores to consume chemically defended algae. However, in this series of experiments, D. antillarum was more selective than expected in its food choices and avoided eating some macroalgae and cyanobacteria commonly found on shallow reefs of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Types of algae and their chemical extracts that deterred feeding include common brown algae (Dictyota and Lobophora spp.) and cyanobacteria (Dichothrix sp.). These feeding preferences have implications for coral reef ecosystems because some macroalgae and cyanobacteria can have negative effects on the survival of other organisms on reefs, including corals.

AB  - Habitat conversion to agricultural land is one of the main threats to terrestrial biodiversity and can affect ecosystem processes and cause changes in ecosystem services (ESs) and disservices (EDs). Yet, studies often rely only on the abundance and diver-sity of the service providers; the effects on ecological processes of habitat conversion are rarely directly monitored. In this study, we used the sentinel approach to evaluate how habitat conversion from native forest to agricultural land affected ESs and EDs on an oceanic island. We quantified herbivory on lettuce plants, invertebrate and vertebrate predation rates on artificial caterpillars, pollination on strawberry plants, seed predation on wheat and mustard seeds, and leaf decomposition rates in native forests, maize fields and pastures on Terceira Island, Azores (Portugal). Herbivory, invertebrate predation rates, and pollination service were not significantly different between habitats. Vertebrate predation rates in native forests (mean 6.1% d-1) were sig-nificantly higher than that in pastures (0.3% d-1), or high-elevation maize fields (0.5% d-1), and marginally higher than in low-elevation maize fields (2.2% d-1). Overall seed predation after 48 h was significantly higher on wheat (mean 16.8%) than mustard seeds (5.6%). High-elevation maize fields also had higher seed predation (27.8%) than low-elevation ones (0.6%) or pastures (3.6%), but did not differ from the native forest (12.9%). Decomposition after 90 days was highest in pastures (78.4% and 45.9%, for tea and rooibos, respectively); although no significant differences between habitats were detected, except for low-elevation maize fields (64.4% and 33.6%). Conversion from native forest to cultivated land did not cause a clear decrease in the intensity of the studied ESs/EDs except for vertebrate predation. Using direct monitoring tools to simultaneously and consistently quantify multiple ecological processes is not only possible but needed, as ecological processes can respond differ-ently to landscape changes.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Aims We tested the establishment success of grassland species in the presence or absence of zoochory by livestock and identified the traits associated with successful establishment. Location Hortobagy National Park, Hungary. Methods In six restored species-poor grasslands we established two species-rich 4 m x 4 m source plots per site in 2013. One source plot was managed by extensive cattle grazing ("zoochory on"), the other one was fenced and protected from grazers ("zoochory off"). We monitored the vegetation development in the source plots (2014-2018), and the establishment success of sown species (2016-2018) in adjacent dispersal plots in four, 20-m-long strips per source plot in a total of 960 dispersal plots. We calculated community-weighted means of thirteen plant traits related to regeneration and competitive ability. The effect of grazing, year, distance from source plots, grazing-year and grazing-distance interactions on population and trait dynamics in the source and dispersal plots were analysed with generalized linear mixed-effect models. Results Although grazing reduced the cover and flowering success of sown species in the source plots, the number of successful establishment events was higher in dispersal plots next to grazed source plots. The sown species were the most abundant in plots adjacent to source plots, but occurred at all monitored distances. Zoochory favoured perennial plants with high specific leaf area (SLA), low leaf dry matter content (LDMC), short stature, light seeds, early flowering period, high clonal index and anemochory index. Conclusions We showed that species that can colonize the matrix with and without zoochory have contrasting trait syndromes. In grazing-adapted ecosystems, fencing source populations of target species does not always seem to be a good option. It was a good tool for increasing the cover and flowering success of the sown species in the short run, but it significantly decreased their chance to colonize the surrounding area in the long run.

AB  - Simple Summary Throughout the world, the ruminant diet is based on conventional feedstuffs, which their price constantly fluctuates, and their use presents a concurrence to human nutrition. The use of alternative feed resources seems to be a solution to reduce charges and diversify ruminants' diet. Olive cake and cactus cladodes are two alternative feed resources that are recommended to be used in ruminant feed. However, their effect on the bacterial community of ruminants is not widely investigated. This study aims to evaluate the effect of olive cake and cactus cladodes on the ruminal microbial ecosystem and meat fatty acids of goat kids. The incorporation of these feedstuffs did not change the bacterial abundance and diversity. Goat kids' rumen liquor seemed to be able to adapt to alternative feed resources incorporation. The introduction of olive cake and cactus cladodes slightly affect meat fatty acids without a negative effect. Thus, ruminants seem to have the ability to adapt to the alternative feed resources digestion, and their use as a feed could diversify feed and reduce feed cost. The olive cake (OC) and the cactus cladodes (CC) are two alternative feed resources widely available in the southern Mediterranean region that could be used in ruminants' diet. Their impact on the rumen bacterial ecosystem is unknown. This work aims to evaluate their effects on the microbial community and meat fatty acids of goat's kids. Forty-four goat kids were divided into four groups receiving diets with conventional concentrate, or 35% OC, or 30% CC, or 15% OC, and 15% CC. After 3 months, these animals were slaughtered, and the rumen liquor and longissimus dorsi and semimembranosus muscles samples were collected. Animals receiving a control diet had rumen liquor with high acidity than test groups (p < 0.001). Test rumen liquor was more adapted to digest efficiently their matching diet than control liquor (p < 0.05). These feedstuffs did not affect rumen bacteria abundance and alpha diversity (richness, evenness, and reciprocal Simpson indexes), and these results were confirmed by beta-diversity tests (NMDS plot, HOMOVA, PERMANOVA). The test diets slightly affected the individual fatty acids of meat (p < 0.05) without effect on fatty acids summaries, indexes, and ratios. Thus, these alternative feed resources could take place in goat kids' diet to diversify their feed and to reduce feed costs.

AB  - Although many plants are dispersed by wind and seeds can travel long distances across unsuitable matrix areas, a large proportion relies on co-evolved zoochorous seed dispersal to connect populations in isolated habitat islands. Particularly in agricultural landscapes, where remaining habitat patches are often very small and highly isolated, mobile linkers as zoochorous seed dispersers are critical for the population dynamics of numerous plant species. However, knowledge about the quali- or quantification of such mobile link processes, especially in agricultural landscapes, is still limited. In a controlled feeding experiment, we recorded the seed intake and germination success after complete digestion by the European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) and explored its mobile link potential as an endozoochoric seed disperser. Utilizing a suite of common, rare, and potentially invasive plant species, we disentangled the effects of seed morphological traits on germination success while controlling for phylogenetic relatedness. Further, we measured the landscape connectivity via hares in two contrasting agricultural landscapes (simple: few natural and semi-natural structures, large fields; complex: high amount of natural and semi-natural structures, small fields) using GPS-based movement data. With 34,710 seeds of 44 plant species fed, one of 200 seeds (0.51%) with seedlings of 33 species germinated from feces. Germination after complete digestion was positively related to denser seeds with comparatively small surface area and a relatively slender and elongated shape, suggesting that, for hares, the most critical seed characteristics for successful endozoochorous seed dispersal minimize exposure of the seed to the stomach and the associated digestive system. Furthermore, we could show that a hare's retention time is long enough to interconnect different habitats, especially grasslands and fields. Thus, besides other seed dispersal mechanisms, this most likely allows hares to act as effective mobile linkers contributing to ecosystem stability in times of agricultural intensification, not only in complex but also in simple landscapes.

AB  - Translocation and captivity are important tools for conservation biology and wildlife management. Understanding the movement ecology of animals following their release in novel terrain is critical to predicting the success of wildlife restoration efforts. Mountain caribou have high conservation value - efforts to restore their populations across western Canada involve hundreds of millions of dollars in science, monitoring, and management activity. Here, we examined the movements of adult female caribou (N = 36) following their translocation to, and release from, a maternity pen ('penned caribou') and compared these movements to animals that were not translocated ('unpenned caribou', N = 22). A maternity pen is a temporary holding facility, within the animals' existing range, that enables them to bear and raise their young in the absence of predators and with augmented resources. Penned and unpenned animals had similar home range sizes (1052.2 and 1314.6 km(2), respectively, P = 0.46) though penned animals moved through the landscape in a faster yet less directed manner. We found some evidence that memory may improve the efficiency of space use. Home ranges with higher quality habitats tended to be smaller than home ranges with poorer quality habitats irrespective of penning status. Penned animals ranged at lower elevation (similar to 150 m) than unpenned animals, particularly in spring and early winter. For penned animals, we did not detect evidence of homing back to the original capture site. The best predictor of how caribou will use the landscape appears to be proximity to the location of the release site. To maximize the fitness of released caribou, future plans for maternity pens and captive breeding programs need to consider the management of food, predators, and habitat across the 1000-2000 km(2) that will form the home range near the release site.

AB  - Mercury is a known potent neurotoxin. The biogeochemical cycle of mercury in the remote Antarctic region is still poorly understood, with Polar climate change contributing added complexity. Longitudinal biomonitoring of mercury accumulation in Antarctic marine megafauna can contribute top-down insight into the bio-physical drivers of wildlife exposure. The bioaccumulative nature of organic mercury renders high trophic predators at the greatest risk of elevated exposure. Humpback whales represent secondary consumers of the Antarctic sea-ice ecosystem and an ideal biomonitoring species for persistent and bioaccumulative compounds due to their extended life-spans. This study provides the first results of mercury accumulation in humpback whales, and places findings within the context of mercury accumulation in both prey, as well as six other species of Antarctic marine megafauna. Combined, these findings contribute new baseline information regarding mercury exposure to Antarctic wildlife, and highlights methodological prerequisites for routine mercury biomonitoring in wildlife via non-lethally biopsied superficial tissues.

AB  - Short-lived nonnative species that become invasive are major agents of change in the American West, and they may interact with fire to have compounding negative effects on ecosystem function. As public lands come under increasing stress from invader-fire interactions, managers need tools that deplete nonnative propagules at meaningful temporal and spatial scales. The pre-emergent herbicide indaziflam, which has been approved for use in natural areas, achieves multi-year control of Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) and other short-lived nonnative species, while leaving co-occurring, established perennials largely intact. Here we explore how pre-fire management with indaziflam shapes plant community assembly post-fire. We ask whether indaziflam (1) maintains good efficacy against the target species Bromus tectorum, Bromus japonicus, and Alyssum simplex in the first growing season post-wildfire, as well as short-lived introduced species more generally; (2) exhibits nontarget effects on short-lived native species; and (3) supports recovery of long-lived native species. Indaziflam was highly effective in controlling all three target species in both burned and unburned areas, revealing its potential to break the invader-fire cycle. However, short-lived native species were also suppressed, either in burned areas only (richness), or in burned and unburned areas (percent cover). As found in other systems, indaziflam had no negative effects on long-lived native species. These findings highlight potential trade-offs in adopting indaziflam as a tool, with its use likely to be extremely effective in highly invaded systems already depauperate of native propagules, but requiring more caution and, if resources allow, attendant restoration plans (e.g., reseeding with desirable natives) in more intact natural areas.

AB  - The nature reserve was founded in 1939 in the limits of the Barsa Kelmes Island (the Aral Sea, Kazakhstan) for the conservation of the saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) and goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa). In 1953 kulan from Turkmenistan (Equus hemionus kulan) were introduced to the island. The drying up of the Aral Sea led to a junction with the mainland, in the late 1990s. In search of water animals began migrating. For more than 20 years, the rangelands of the former island have not been grazed. A comparative analysis of rangeland productivity between the modern period and the 1970-80s of the last century showed that it has been increased by almost 2 times due to 20 years break of grazing pressure. The natural diet of wild ungulates in the reserve includes 105 species of vascular plants belonging to 26 families and 70 genera. A rangeland map has been compiled based on the interpretation of satellite imagery and field data. The legend to the map contains 16 mapped units. Each mapping unit corresponds to a rangeland type. For each type of rangeland, the total yield is calculated for seasons of the year. The map provides important information for understanding the available forage resources for wild ungulates.

AB  - Fire ants (Solenopsis spp.) have increasingly been reported from carrion in the southeastern United States and are now a part of the normal succession community. There have been previous observations of these ants altering carrion and preying on other carrion-attendant fauna; however, the overall effects of these activities on carrion decomposition rates, community composition, and blow fly larval development are poorly understood. Alteration of these ecological processes by fire ants could affect the forensic interpretation of entomological data. We conducted a study in Mississippi and Florida whereby portions of the succession fauna were excluded from access to pig carrion to study the relative effects of fire ants and blow flies on carrion decomposition and succession: a control with all fauna having access, a second treatment where fire ants and other geophilic taxa were excluded, and a third treatment in which blow flies and other large organisms were excluded. Fire ants inflicted lesions in the carrion, buried portions that touched the ground, and preyed on some members of the succession fauna. Their exclusion did not affect carrion decomposition rates that were measured but slightly affected the overall carrion community, and strongly affected the oviposition and development of blow flies. Despite the presence of fire ants early in the control, blow flies were eventually able to overcome predation of eggs and larvae, continue colonization, and complete development; however, the delay in the colonization of blow flies on carrion could affect the determination of postmortem intervals when development rates of blow flies are considered in the calculation.

AB  - In south-central Chile, the dynamics of southern beech (Nothofagaceae) stands vary predictably along climatic gradients. Beeches form persistent stands at high elevations, but their establishment on lowland sites depends mainly on catastrophic disturbances. In New Zealand, nearly all studies of beech forest dynamics to date have reported all-sized, persistent populations. However, previous work has focused largely on the South Island or on North Island mountains, where beeches are widespread and often dominant. Little is known about beech dynamics in the warm North Island lowlands, where beeches are less common. We aimed to clarify the circumstances that enable beeches to establish on lowland sites in the North Island. We measured population structures of beeches and associated species on 11 plots distributed across a range of climate, lithology and topography. On sites where the most shade-tolerant broadleaved trees were absent or uncommon, all-sized populations showed that beech regeneration did not depend on major disturbances. These stands were located mostly on steep faces or ridges with soil carbon:nitrogen ratios > 18, usually with ericaceous understoreys. On sites with higher N availability, where shade-tolerant broadleaved trees were abundant, beech populations were generally sparser, with restricted age ranges. One of these +/- even-aged beech stands appeared to have established after windthrow, the other four after fires. Recent dieback of Weinmannia racemosa associated with insect attack had resulted in another wave of beech regeneration in one of the post-fire stands. Establishment on landslides appears to only rarely enable beeches to capture new sites in the lowland North Island. We conclude that beeches form stable self-replacing stands on lowland North Island sites with low nitrogen availability, but that exogenous disturbances occasionally enable beeches to establish as pioneers on sites with higher nitrogen availability. The early successionalrole commonly seen in lowland south-central Chile thus appears less widespread in New Zealand.

AB  - Feral cats are some of the most destructive invasive predators worldwide, particularly in insular environments; hence, density-reduction campaigns are often applied to alleviate the predation mortality they add to native fauna. Density-reduction and eradication efforts are costly procedures with important outcomes for native fauna recovery, so they require adequate planning to be successful. These plans should include empirical density-reduction models that can guide yearly culling quotas, and resource roll-out for the duration of the culling period. This ensures densities are reduced over the long term and that resources are not wasted. We constructed a stochastic population model with cost estimates to test the relative effectiveness and cost-efficiency of two main culling scenarios for a 10-year eradication campaign of cats on Kangaroo Island, Australia: (a) constant proportional annual cull (one-phase), and (b) high initial culling followed by a constant proportional maintenance cull (two-phase). A one-phase cull of at least 0.35 of the annual population size would reduce the final population to 0.1 of its original size, while a two-phase cull with an initial cull of minimum 0.6 and minimum 0.5 maintenance cull would reduce the final population to 0.01 of its initial size within the 10-year time frame. Cost estimates varied widely depending on the methods applied (shooting, trapping, aerial poison baits, Felixer (TM) poison-delivery system), but using baiting, trapping and Felixers with additional shooting to meet culling quotas was the most cost-effective combination (minimum cost: AU$19.56 million; range: AU$16.87 million-AU$20.69 million). Our model provides an adaptable and general assessment tool for cat reductions in Australia and potentially elsewhere, and provides relative culling costs for the Kangaroo Island campaign specifically.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to introduce the model CARIBOUMOD, which simulates the dynamics of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations in Ontario and Quebec, Canada. The model, based on the Verhulst-Pearl population dynamics equation, relies on input population parameters commonly collected across many woodland caribou populations in Canada (e.g., calf-female ratios, proportion of females and mortality rates) and has the option to account for variability in population parameters using a Monte Carlo algorithm. Population projections over 50 years were performed for 18 woodland caribou populations in Ontario and Quebec. The most recently published demographic data were used to initialize input parameters of the model. Three different carrying capacity levels were tested to demonstrate the sensitivity of the model to the density-dependent term. If the recruitment and mortality rates were to remain similar over time, 15 of the 18 populations would be expected to decline, one would remain stable, and two would increase. For 13 populations, carrying capacity had a negligible effect on simulated population dynamics. However, carrying capacity had a non-negligible effect on the rate of increase for the two increasing populations, and on the rate of decline for the three populations where initial population densities were more than 20% of the lowest carrying capacity level tested. The population dynamics model can be used to simulate long-term patterns of population development based on current knowledge and determine whether population dynamics can be predicted using data from current population monitoring protocols. For some local populations, additional surveys of demographic data are desirable to better characterize the long-term population trajectories. The ability to simulate populations using alternative input parameters, including recruitment, mortality and extraction (harvest) rates, was integrated in the developed software (CARIBOUMOD), allowing it to facilitate the analysis of the effects of management scenarios and the development of conservation policies.

AB  - Ecosystems worldwide are under increasing threat. We applied a standardized method for assessing the risk of ecosystem collapse, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Ecosystems, to coral reefs in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO), covering 11,919 km(2) of reef (similar to 5% of the global total). Our approach combined indicators of change in historic ecosystem extent, ecosystem functioning (hard corals, fleshy algae, herbivores and piscivores) and projected sea temperature warming. We show that WIO coral reefs are vulnerable to collapse at the regional level, while in 11 nested ecoregions they range from critically endangered (islands, driven by future warming) to vulnerable (continental coast and northern Seychelles, driven principally by fishing pressure). Responses to avoid coral reef collapse must include ecosystem-based management of reefs and adjacent systems combined with mitigating and adapting to climate change. Our approach can be replicated across coral reefs globally to help countries and other actors meet conservation and sustainability targets set under multiple global conventions-including the Convention on Biological Diversity's post-2020 global biodiversity framework and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Evolution should favour plasticity in dispersal decisions in response to spatial heterogeneity in social and environmental contexts. Sex differences in individual optimization of dispersal decisions are poorly documented in mammals, because species where both sexes commonly disperse are rare. To elucidate the sex-specific drivers governing dispersal, we investigated sex differences in condition dependence in the propensity and distance of natal dispersal in one such species, the roe deer, using fine-scale monitoring of 146 GPS-collared juveniles in an intensively monitored population in southwest France. Dispersal propensity increased with body mass in males such that 36% of light individuals dispersed, whereas 62% of heavy individuals did so, but there was no evidence for condition dependence in dispersal propensity among females. By contrast, dispersal distance increased with body mass at a similar rate in both sexes such that heavy dispersers travelled around twice as far as light dispersers. Sex differences in the strength of condition-dependent dispersal may result from different selection pressures acting on the behaviour of males and females. We suggest that females disperse prior to habitat saturation being reached, likely in relation to the risk of inbreeding. By contrast, natal dispersal in males is likely governed by competitive exclusion through male-male competition for breeding opportunities in this strongly territorial mammal. Our study is, to our knowledge, a first demonstration that condition dependence in dispersal propensity and dispersal distance may be decoupled, indicating contrasting selection pressures drive the behavioural decisions of whether or not to leave the natal range, and where to settle.

AB  - Simple Summary African swine fever (ASF) is a highly lethal viral disease affecting suids and caused by the African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV). ASF was described for the first time in 1921 in Kenya. The ASF genotype I virus was introduced to Europe in 1957, marking the onset of the first European wave. In 2007, ASFV genotype II was detected in Georgia, affecting domestic pigs and wild boars, and it later spread to several European and extra-European countries, including Italy. This report focuses on the strategic challenges encountered in the attempt to eradicate ASFV amongst domestic pigs in the Lombardy region. The joint efforts that were implemented facilitated the eradication of ASF in domestic pigs in just over 1.5 months, representing an example of effective and timely cooperation to mitigate both the spread of the infection and the economic repercussions for the Italian and global pig industries.Abstract African swine fever (ASF) is a severe viral disease characterized by high lethality in suids and caused by the African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV). The ASF genotype I virus was introduced to Europe in 1957, marking the onset of the first European epidemic wave. In 2007, ASFV genotype II was detected in Georgia, affecting domestic pigs and wild boars before spreading to various European and extra-European countries, including Italy. The first case of ASFV in Italy was documented on 7 January 2022, in a wild boar in the Piedmont region. Since then, several ASFV-positive wild boar carcasses have been identified in the Piedmont and Liguria regions. By June 2023, ASFV had spread to Lombardy, one of the major pig-producing regions in northern Italy; the virus was first detected in early summer in wild boar carcasses. Two months later, it was diagnosed in a commercial pig farm as a consequence of the disease's spread amongst wild boars and an increase in the viral environmental load. This report aims to describe the features of ASFV domestic pig outbreaks that occurred in the Zinasco municipality (Lombardy) and the joint efforts to mitigate potential direct and indirect economic impacts on the Italian and global pig industry. The epidemiological investigation and the measures implemented, which were all performed according to national and European regulations, as well as exceptional ad hoc measures aimed at protecting the pig industry, are described in order to provide a practical and effective approach to combating ASF.

AB  - Achieving global targets for ecosystem restoration necessitates the development of effective restoration approaches. Current restoration approaches focus primarily on mitigating abiotic stresses or supplementing propagules to restore foundation species that support associated species by 'engineering' local habitats. Although keystone predators can strongly affect foundation species in natural ecosystems via trophic cascades and are often diminished in degraded ecosystems, they are traditionally neglected in efforts to restore foundation species.Here, we investigated how a keystone predator (Scylla serrata) might affect the restoration of a foundational plant (Scirpus mariqueter) in a degraded salt marsh. In a series of restoration experiments, we examined the effects of proximity to existing Scylla burrows, as well reintroducing Scylla, on the establishment of planted Scirpus in restoration areas. Furthermore, we tested if Scylla affected Scirpus via non-consumptive effects in experiments that controlled Scylla's consumption of grazers.We found that planted Scirpus suffered less grazing and achieved higher density in areas closer to existing Scylla burrows where Scylla predation on grazers was stronger. Consistently, reintroduction of Scylla reduced grazing on Scirpus and increased its density by 360%. These positive effects of Scylla on Scirpus were driven by consumptive effects that reduced the abundance of grazers and by non-consumptive effects that inhibited the herbivory by grazers.Synthesis and applications. These results demonstrate that incorporation of keystone predators, including both their consumptive and non-consumptive effects, into restoration designs can greatly enhance the restoration of foundation species. Our study thus highlights the value of co-restoring keystone predators and foundation species. Given that predators are depleted in many ecosystems, this co-restoration approach may be broadly applicable.

AB  - Marine animals such as the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) rely on a productive marine environment and are vulnerable to oceanic changes that can affect their reproduction and survival rates. Davis Base, Antarctica, acts as a moulting site for southern elephant seals that forage in Prydz Bay, but the mitochondrial haplotype diversity and natal source populations of these seals have not been characterized. In this study, we combined genetic and animal tracking data on these moulting seals to identify levels of mitochondrial haplotype diversity, natal source population, and movement behaviours during foraging and haul-out periods. Using partial sequences of the mitochondrial control region, we identified two major breeding mitochondrial lineages of seals at Davis Base. We found that the majority of the seals originated from breeding stocks within the South Atlantic Ocean and South Indian Ocean. One seal was grouped with the Macquarie Island breeding stock (South Pacific Ocean). The Macquarie Island population, unlike the other two stocks, is decreasing in size. Tracking data revealed long-distance foraging activity of the Macquarie Island seal around Crozet Islands. We speculate that changes to the Antarctic marine environment can result in a shift in foraging and movement strategies, which subsequently affects seal population growth rates.

AB  - Camera-based abundance estimators are an alternative methodology of growing interest in both research and management applications. The statistical formulations of camera-based abundance estimators using time-lapse data should theoretically produce precise and unbiased estimates; however, production of unbiased results also requires meeting several important assumptions, and real-world case studies evaluating such results remain relatively few. We applied instantaneous sampling (IS) and space-to-event (STE) estimators to remote camera data collected in April 2021 via time-lapse sampling of closed populations of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) on Wild Horse Island in western Montana, USA, and compared results for bighorn sheep to aerial and ground-based counts. Point estimates from camera-based approaches underestimated bighorn sheep populations by 32-44% (IS estimator) and 62-69% (STE estimator) relative to aerial and ground counts. Patchy spatial distribution and group-living behavior of sheep resulted in a high degree of noise surrounding the IS estimate. In comparison, a low point estimate with relatively narrow confidence intervals suggested potential sensitivity of the STE estimator to violating assumptions of independence among individual animals and sampling occasions. Estimates of mule deer had improved precision over sheep estimates, as indicated by lower estimated coefficients of variation of the mean (CVmean) derived from the analytic SE estimator. Using 15-m viewsheds and the IS estimators, mule deer density estimates came with a 26% CVmean compared to 43% CVmean for bighorn sheep. This discrepancy may be a result of differences in distribution, behavior, and relative abundance between the 2 species. Accounting for group size and increasing time between sampling may improve accuracy of density estimates and adhere better to model assumptions when estimating precision. In addition, factors influencing viewshed and resulting density extrapolations must be considered carefully. While camera-based methods theoretically provide an alternative way to estimate density when traditional methods are impractical, our results suggest that more work is needed to ensure density estimates are accurate and precise enough to inform population management.

AB  - Aim: The microbial metabolic quotient (MMQ; mg CO2- C/mg MBC/h), defined as the amount of microbial CO2 respired (MR; mg CO2- C/kg soil/h) per unit of microbial biomass C (MBC; mg C/kg soil), is a key parameter for understanding the microbial regulation of the carbon (C) cycle, including soil C sequestration. Here, we experimentally tested hypotheses about the individual and interactive effects of multiple nutrient addition (nitrogen + phosphorus + potassium + micronutrients) and herbivore exclusion on MR, MBC and MMQ across 23 sites (five continents). Our sites encompassed a wide range of edaphoclimatic conditions; thus, we assessed which edaphoclimatic variables affected MMQ the most and how they interacted with our treatments.Location: Australia, Asia, Europe, North/South America.Time period: 2015-2016.Major taxa: Soil microbes.Methods: Soils were collected from plots with established experimental treatments. MR was assessed in a 5 week laboratory incubation without glucose addition, MBC via substrate-induced respiration. MMQ was calculated as MR/MBC and corrected for soil temperatures (MMQsoil). Using linear mixed effects models (LMMs) and structural equation models (SEMs), we analysed how edaphoclimatic characteristics and treatments interactively affected MMQsoil.Results: MMQsoil was higher in locations with higher mean annual temperature, lower water holding capacity and lower soil organic C concentration, but did not respond to our treatments across sites as neither MR nor MBC changed. We attributed this relative homeostasis to our treatments to the modulating influence of edaphoclimatic variables. For example, herbivore exclusion, regardless of fertilization, led to greater MMQsoil only at sites with lower soil organic C (< 1.7%).Main conclusions: Our results pinpoint the main variables related to MMQsoil across grasslands and emphasize the importance of the local edaphoclimatic conditions in controlling the response of the C cycle to anthropogenic stressors. By testing hypotheses about MMQsoil across global edaphoclimatic gradients, this work also helps to align the conflicting results of prior studies.

AB  - Clarifying the influence of disturbances by biotic and abiotic agents on long-term changes in forest structure and demographic rates is an important task of forest ecology. Here, we investigated changes in forest structure and demographic rates and the effects of biotic and abiotic factors (sika deer, ambrosia beetle, neighborhood trees, and indices of strong wind and wetness) in a 4-ha long-term ecological study plot in a lowland warm temperate rain forest on Yakushima Island, Japan, from 1996 to 2019 for three regeneration groups related to gap dynamics (gap demander: GD, light shade tolerant: LS, and strong shade tolerant: SS). GD had relatively lower recruitment and survival than LS and/or SS. Changes in demographic rates were not significantly correlated with those in the index of strong wind in any regeneration group. The effects of sika deer on demographic rates did not differ among groups. Stems of Fagaceae species belonging to LS attacked by ambrosia beetles recorded in 2013 did not significantly differ in RGR and survival rates. Our results indicate that despite the relatively long monitoring period of 23 years, we did not detect significant effects of strong winds on demographic rates among regeneration groups, and shade-tolerant species (LS and SS) showed better demographic performance than light-demanding species (GD) and an increase in total basal area over time. We need longer monitoring of forest dynamics to understand forest responses to disturbances considering several factors, including the time lag of demographic responses to disturbances and the long-term effects of disturbances.

AB  - The use of seawater by terrestrial mammals is often overlooked, despite its ecological and habitat management significance. This study investigated whether sika deer Cervus nippon, which are capable of drinking highly concentrated saltwater, utilize seawater in coastal areas. Multiple deer tracks were found on a beach, indicating that at least three individuals had come from the forest edge to the tide pool. Although, this study did not provide conclusive evidence that the deer drank seawater, it did show that they use the beach, suggesting that they may be drinking seawater from the tide pools. This is an important finding, indicating that terrestrial mammals beyond Bovidae may also drink seawater.

AB  - River ecosystems are facing significant degradation from human activities, which impact both biotic (e.g., fish and invertebrates) and abiotic components (e.g., water and habitat). A comprehensive comparison of energy flow patterns and system attributes among river food webs under different levels of human interference is highly important for developing management strategies to protect river ecosystems. Along the subtropical Pearl River, six spatial zones, including agricultural, industrial, island, urban, factory, and estuarine areas, were chosen to construct the Ecopath models. The output results revealed that the highest trophic level of the Pearl River was 3.8-4.2, which was occupied by softshell turtles and piscivorous/carnivorous fish. The most diverse functional groups were found in island and estuarine zones due to their heterogeneous habitats (e.g., high submerged vegetation coverage and the transition area between fresh and brackish water). In contrast, the food web structure in the industrial zone was destroyed due to water pollution (e.g., sewage discharge) and habitat degradation. The increase in exotic species and the decrease in native top predators were two factors that result in the low efficiency of energy transmission. A series of trophic (e.g., Lindeman transfer efficiency and mixed predator-prey impacts), structural (e.g., keystoneness, omnivory, and Finn's path length), and theoretical (e.g., connectance and ascendency) indices revealed that the health and maturity of the Pearl River sections can be ranked as island > estuarine > agricultural > urban > factory > industrial zones. The food chains led by softshell turtles (Pelodiscus sinensis), piscivores (e.g., Elopichthys bambusa), molluscivores (e.g., Mylopharyngodon piceus), and herbivores (e.g., Ctenopharyngodon idelus) could be used to indicate the health and functioning of river ecosystems. Our results suggest that the ecological management of river ecosystems should focus more efforts on protecting original habitats (e.g., the island zone with fish feeding/spawning grounds), monitoring bioindicators with keystone trophic impacts in the food web, and evaluating the food chains that play important roles in upward energy transmission.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link (Broom or Scotch Broom) (Sarothamnus scoparius (L.) W.D.J. Koch) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to the environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. Broom is shade-intolerant and drought-tolerant, aided by c. 40% of net carbon fixation coming from stem photosynthesis and an ability to shed leaves in inclement periods. It is at its best in lowland, open, disturbed habitats but also open woodland; widespread across Britain, Ireland and much of Europe. It has been widely introduced to all continents (except Antarctica) where due to its prolific seeding and rapid spread it is often an invasive shrub. Broom thrives in an oceanic climate on a range of moist soils but is capable of invading arid and poor soils, helped by its ability to acquire 50% of its nitrogen from bacteria in root nodules. Broom is an obligate seeder, pollinated by a limited range of insects, primarily bees large enough to trip the explosive pollination mechanism. Seeds are dispersed explosively from the fruit and secondarily moved by ants attracted to the elaiosome. The water impermeable seed coat results in high dormancy, and so broom forms a significant seed bank. In Britain and Ireland, populations are showing little decline and broom is not considered to be at threat of extinction. In introduced areas, broom can rapidly spread despite browsing by native species and livestock. Biological control using a range of insects introduced from native areas, particularly seed eaters, together with mechanical and possibly chemical treatment, is showing some promise in its control.

AB  - The concurring effect of herbivory by wild ungulates and drought events is experiencing a notable increase in Mediterranean and temperate forests. While many studies have addressed the influence of drought on plant susceptibility to herbivory, it appears crucial to comprehend the impact of prolonged browsing on the physiological response of plants to increasing water deficit. To this end, we analyzed the effect of long-term recurrent herbivory by ungulates on physiological, biochemical, anatomical and morphological variables of Ilex aquifolium and Fagus sylvatica saplings during the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019 in a mixed sub-Mediterranean forest. We compared plants growing within an exclosure fence since 2006 (unbrowsed) with plants growing outside (browsed) that were also fenced during the study to investigate herbivory legacy. Twelve years of herbivory pressure modified significantly plant functional performance. Independently of the species, browsed plants showed higher root-to-shoot ratio, stem cross-sectional area-to-leaf area ratio, predawn leaf water potential, leaf nitrogen concentration and leaf gas exchange rates than unbrowsed plants. Moreover, browsed plants had lower leaf bulk modulus of elasticity, and higher osmotic potential at full turgor and turgor loss point. Thus, herbivory modified the leaf economic spectrum towards a more resource-acquisitive and less water stress tolerant type. These results suggest that, once browsing has subsided, plants continue to reflect some legacy effects that make them more vulnerable to further abiotic and biotic stresses, which has implications for forest regeneration.

AB  - Plant dwarfism, a syndrome characterised by a significant reduction in plant height and organ size, is a widely observed pattern of stress-tolerant life-form evolution that results from local adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. The drivers of assemblage-level dwarfism have primarily been attributed to abiotic factors, such as low temperature, aridity, poor soil fertility or frequent fires. While biotic factors such as grazing pressure from herbivores can contribute to the establishment of plant dwarfism, these factors have rarely been tested at assemblage levels. Focusing on a dwarf plant assemblage comprising over 80 taxa on a small continental island in Japan with a high deer density, we hypothesised that historical deer grazing could also be a factor contributing to the large-scale convergent evolution of dwarfism. To test this hypothesis, we measured the size of 1908 individual plants of 40 taxa pairs, comprising both palatable and unpalatable pairs from the island and their counterpart taxa from neighbouring regions, and sought to assess which factors (i.e. low solar radiation, estimated divergence time, low nutrient conditions and grazing pressure from deer) may have contributed to the formation of the dwarf plant assemblage on the island. We also performed genetic analysis to infer the time frames for the establishment of dwarf taxa. Statistical analyses revealed that plant size was significantly reduced mainly among the palatable taxa growing on the island, with preferential grazing by deer being identified as the most significant factor influencing plant size. Furthermore, genetic analyses revealed that dwarf ecotypes may have evolved over tens of thousands of years. Synthesis: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that interactions with herbivores can shape the assemblage-level convergence of plant dwarfism. These findings enhance our current understanding of the formation of plant functional diversity.
   Plant dwarfism is a widely observed phenomenon worldwide, with abiotic factors such as low temperature, aridity, strong winds, and poor soil fertility commonly considered its major drivers. This study investigated the triggering factor of a dwarf plant assemblage comprising over 80 taxa from nearly 40 families in a small island. Through multispecies comparison analysis, compelling evidence was found that, among the candidate factors (climatic conditions, nutrient availability, and demographic history), deer preference significantly influenced the variation in plant size within the island. This suggests that dwarf plant assemblages may have evolved in response to herbivore grazing pressure. This study provides the first demonstration that plant-herbivore interactions can drive assemblage-level convergent evolution of dwarfism, expanding our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the formation of plant diversity.image

AB  - Slash walls are a novel strategy that could help maintain species on sites where ungulate browse limits tree regeneration. We established five slash walls in southern New England, USA to examine the influence of pre-harvest tree metrics and deer exclusion on stump sprout height and survival at 160 sample points (n =1509 trees). For all species groups, dominant sprouts were taller inside the walls at the end of the first and second growing seasons. After 2 years, mean sprout heights were similar to 2.5 times higher for Quercus rubra (1.8 vs. 0.7 m) and >6 times higher for Acer saccharum (2.0 vs. 0.3 m) inside the walls. For some species, the proportion of stumps with a live sprout after 1 year was higher inside the slash walls (56% vs. 28% for Q. rubra and 77% vs. 55% for Carya ovata). By contrast, sprouting success was uniformly high for Acer rubrum (78%) and Liriodendron tulipifera (87%). Differences in sprout survival inside versus outside the walls increased during the second year for Q. rubra, C. ovata, and A. saccharum. Where maintaining Q. rubra is a management objective, excluding deer will increase both the growth of stump sprouts and the proportion of stumps with a live sprout.

AB  - The border region between Austria, the Czech Republic, and Germany harbors the most south-western occurrence of moose in continental Europe. The population originated in Poland, where moose survived, immigrated from former Soviet Union or were reintroduced after the Second World War expanded west- and southwards. In recent years, the distribution of the nonetheless small Central European population seems to have declined, necessitating an evaluation of its current status. In this study, existing datasets of moose observations from 1958 to 2019 collected in the three countries were combined to create a database totaling 771 records (observations and deaths). The database was then used to analyze the following: (a) changes in moose distribution, (b) the most important mortality factors, and (c) the availability of suitable habitat as determined using a maximum entropy approach. The results showed a progressive increase in the number of moose observations after 1958, with peaks in the 1990s and around 2010, followed by a relatively steep drop after 2013. Mortality within the moose population was mostly due to human interactions, including 13 deadly wildlife-vehicle collisions, particularly on minor roads, and four animals that were either legally culled or poached. Our habitat model suggested that higher altitudes (ca. 700-1,000 m a.s.l.), especially those offering wetlands, broad-leaved forests and natural grasslands, are the preferred habitats of moose whereas steep slopes and areas of human activity are avoided. The habitat model also revealed the availability of large core areas of suitable habitat beyond the current distribution, suggesting that habitat was not the limiting factor explaining the moose distribution in the study area. Our findings call for immediate transboundary conservation measures to sustain the moose population, such as those aimed at preventing wildlife-vehicle collisions and illegal killings. Infrastructure planning and development activities must take into account the habitat requirements of moose.

AB  - The benthic ecosystem in temperate regions is becoming barren owing to the replacement of macroalgae by calcareous algae as a result of climate change-induced increases in water temperature. The aim of this study was to observe how the top shell, Turbo sazae, an invertebrate that feeds on macroalgae, adapts to a benthic environment with a reduced macroalgae population owing to replacement by calcareous algae. Using tank experiments, the top shells were cultured for 18 weeks. Within this period, they were fed a diet comprising either Eclonia cava or Corallina officinalis. Thereafter, hemocyte response, reproductive development, and the levels of biochemical compounds in the individuals under investigation were analyzed. The results obtained showed no significant differences in immunological responses, gonad development, and general body weight between the two feeding groups. However, amino acid profiling showed a decreasing trend in amino acid contents in both feeding groups, but no significant differences were observed with respect to overall protein content. These findings indirectly suggested that even in a macroalgae-depleted environment, the top shells can survive by consuming crustose calcareous algae, but with the change in diet affecting the levels of some amino acids in their bodies. Therefore, this study provides valuable insights into the adaptability of the top shells inhabiting the waters around Jeju Island to changes in their feeding environment and may also serve as basis for enhancing resource management strategies in response to climate change-induced changes in the benthic ecosystem.

AB  - Data on movement of grey wolves (Canis lupus) in island systems is largely restricted to coastal environments and little is known about their space use and movement in freshwater archipelagos. We used data from a GPS-collared wolf in a protected archipelago in Lake Superior, Ontario to examine broad seasonal patterns in space use, movement, and activity. Over approximately 1 y of monitoring, the wolf made 190 crossings between islands and showed more extensive use of the archipelago during the nonwinter season. When ice was present in the archipelago, the mean weekly inter-island crossing rate of the wolf (6 SE) was 6.08 +/- 1.31, with crossings largely restricted to the interior islands bounded by ice, compared to 2.85 +/- 0.45 during the open water season. Mean wolf activity was highest in the nonwinter season, but movement rates were comparable across seasons. Our study is the first to document wolf movements in a freshwater archipelago with seasonal ice cover and supports data collection at fine temporal scales to better understand trends in wolf space use and movement at small spatial scales.

AB  - The Japanese serow, Capricornis crispus, is a species endemic to Japan, residing in the mountainous forests of Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. Gunma Prefecture, situated in central Honshu, is one of its habitats. To evaluate the genetic diversity and interrelationships among local populations in Gunma Prefecture, we examined the mitochondrial DNA control region sequences of 364 individuals. Our analysis, using all accessible Japanese serow sequences, revealed that they can be broadly categorized into four clades, labeled I to VI. Within Gunma Prefecture, we identified 15 distinct haplotypes, which can be classified into three haplogroups: G1, G2, and G3. G1, included in clade I, is associated with those reported in northeastern Honshu. G2, which forms clade IV on its own, is predominantly endemic to Gunma Prefecture, with a frequency of 90% in Showa Village at the western base of Mt. Akagi. In contrast, G3, included in clade V, forms a sister group to the haplotype discovered in the Japanese Alps. The haplotype composition exhibited a stark contrast between the regions on the west and east sides of the Kanto Plain, indicating that the Kanto Plain serves as a dividing line for Japanese serow populations. In Tsumagoi Village, 134 out of 144 animals shared the same haplotype, resulting in extremely low haplotype diversity, as indicated by a significant negative value in neutrality tests. This finding aligns with the observed rapid increase in serow in Tsumagoi.

AB  - Small recreational boats are an omnipresent source of sound pollution in shallow coastal habitats, which can impact the behavior and physiology of a wide array of taxa. However, effective monitoring of this stressor is currently limited by a lack of tools. The present study coupled passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) with timelapse imagery to provide a comprehensive analysis of sound pollution at two coastal sites varying in habitat structure: Goat (rocky reef) and Kawau (sandy bay) Islands. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to automatically count boats in each image, and the relationship between the soundscape and number of boats present was analysed using power spectral density and adaptive threshold analyses. Small boat activity was positively correlated with third octave level (TOL) root mean squared sound pressure levels (SPLRMS 63 - 5011 Hz), and this effect was frequency dependent, at both Goat (F-7,F-9704 = 5.665, p < 0.001) and Kawau (F-7,F-42488 = 325.33, p < 0.001) Islands. However, at Goat Island this interaction effect was driven by a significant difference between 63 Hz and all other TOLs (p < 0.05), whereas at Kawau Island the interaction effect of TOL and boat number was more variable. Furthermore, low frequency (similar to 50 - 300 Hz) biophony was found to influence the likelihood of boat sound being detected at Goat Island. Small boat impacts are contextual, likely due to habitat specific propagation conditions and the presence/absence of vocalising animals. As such, monitoring of sound pollution in coastal habitats requires a tailored approach which accounts for the localised nature of shallow coastal soundscapes. These findings demonstrate the potential for timelapse imagery to elucidate variability in boat sound, which may be particularly useful for remote sites which are ecologically rich, yet have no acoustic protections, such as many marine protected areas.

AB  - Here, we document major seabird breeding recovery on a satellite island of Curacao in the southern Caribbean following the removal of goats in 1997, significant reforestation from 2000-2005, and the extermination of cats in 2001. The only seabird to have been confirmed to breed on the island since the 1960s and until recently has been the Least Tern (Sternula antillarum). However, we now confirm nesting for an additional eight sea-and shorebird species on the island for the first time based on field observations in 2021 and 2022. The total number of documented nesting pairs annually has increased from a maximum of 140 pairs (of a single species in 2002), to > 430 pairs (of all species combined) in 2021 and 650 pairs in 2022. The dominant species are the Cayenne Tern (Thalassaeus sandviscensis), Laughing Gull (Larus atricilla), Sooty Tern (Onychoprion fuscatus), and Least Tern, in that order. Breeding by the Sooty Tern and Bridled Tern (Onychoprion anatheus) are new national records for Curacao. Klein Curacao is now the island group's most diverse and active seabird breeding location. Major threats to the nascent recovery of seabird breeding in this Ramsar-designated wetland area are the growing and uncontrolled human recreation, the repeated threat of reintroduction of feral cats, and predation by rats. Recommendations are made on measures needed to address these threats. The case study of Klein Curacao demonstrates the potential for seabird recovery when deleterious invasive mammals are eradicated from islands.

AB  - Biological invasions represent one of the main threats to biodiversity and a recognized economic burden worldwide; the issue has been included in the conservation agenda such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Brazil is a signatory country of the CBD; however, the number of alien species records in its territory is continuously rising. To evaluate the invasive alien species (IAS) policy in Brazil, we reviewed the legislation delineating historical trends to identify potential gaps and avenues for improvement. We consulted several websites using keywords related to invasions in order to track legal instruments such as laws, decrees and regulations. We classified the documents regarding their main aims with regard to IAS, taxon and environment of interest. We found 85 legal instruments in force related to IAS published in the federal sphere up to October 2021, with decrees being the most common type. Most documents were classified as 'control' and 'prevention' and were related to all taxa and environments. Two species (wild boar Sus scrofa and golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei) have more specific legislation, probably due to their conspicuous economic impacts. We discuss policy gaps and their implications for the efficient management and prevention of new IAS introductions to the country.

TI  - Understanding the co-evolutionary relationships between Indigenous cultures and non-native species can inform more effective approaches to conservation: the example of pigs (pua'a; Sus scrofa) in Hawai'i

AB  - Indigenous resource management (IRM) is dynamic and ever evolving, in part because it is based on co-evolutionary relationships between Indigenous cultures and the biodiversity around them. Forms of conservation imposed on Indigenous people and places by settler-colonialism tend to idealise pre-human and human-excluded environments, leading to conflicts between settler-coloniser conservationists and Indigenous communities detrimental to conservation goals. Conservation efforts that align with IRM and acknowledge the co-evolutionary relationships at the foundation of Indigenous culture can lead to more effective conservation efforts. In Hawai'i, the evolving relationship between Kanaka (Hawaiians) and pua'a (pigs; Sus scrofa) has been the flash point of conflicts between settler-coloniser conservationists and Hawaiian communities. This paper examines the co-evolving relationships between Hawaiians and pigs in an effort to better balance the conservation efforts aimed at controlling invasive species with the State of Hawai'i's obligation to support Indigenous practices and public hunting. We conducted this research by investigating archival Hawaiian language resources, which allowed us to resurrect knowledge lost to time and pinpoint key historical changes over the past 250 years. Our results elucidate this co-evolutionary relationship that shifted from an animal-husbandry relationship to a hunter-prey relationship in the first half of the 19th century. This change in the trajectory of the co-evolutionary relationship was a result of various shifts throughout Hawaiian socio-ecological systems, and therefore necessitates adaptive governance relating to management of and access to pigs. We conclude that Indigenous perspectives offer opportunities to transform conservation biology through multi-objective approaches that address both hunting and conservation goals.

AB  - Introduced deer are threatening Australia's natural values. Deer control is increasingly being implemented to reduce deer populations and mitigate their impacts. However, control programmes are expensive and challenging, particularly in peri-urban and agricultural landscapes. We present assessments of three typical deer control programmes from peri-urban/agricultural Victoria, south-eastern Australia. We assess programme effectiveness in reducing deer activity by using faecal pellet counts and/or camera traps, provide reflections from researchers and land managers on the potential reasons for programme successes, or lack thereof and highlight potential changes in programme strategies to improve outcomes. Ground-shooting by volunteer and/or contractor shooters removed primarily sambar (Cervus unicolor) in two programmes (Tarago State Forest, 2022-2023; and Jumping Creek catchment, 2017-2022), and both sambar and fallow deer (Dama dama) from the third programme (Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve, 2014-2019). In general, the deer control programmes did not reduce deer activity or impacts. Deer control was often too spatially restricted, and the frequency or intensity was insufficient to remove an adequate number of deer to reduce overall activity and subsequent impacts. Deer populations also often moved away from locations subject to control. Deer control is particularly difficult in fragmented peri-urban and agricultural landscapes due to deer immigration and emigration, and the logistical challenges of operating in a multi-tenure environment. To be effective, programmes need to be applied at appropriate spatial scales, monitored and adaptively managed. Community consultation and engagement is essential in peri-urban and agricultural areas to enable coordinated control across different land tenures, supported by adequate resourcing. Monitoring is critical to determine control effectiveness and enable programmes to be adaptively managed. Building on the successful collaborations and lessons learnt from previous control programmes, future programmes need to be more strategic and well-resourced to enable land managers to tackle the increasing threat posed by introduced deer in Australia.

AB  - Australia's species extinction rate is one of the highest in the world. Yet, there is limited evidence regarding people's recognition of, and preferences and support for, Australian endangered wildlife. This paper presents survey responses from 223 Zoos Victoria visitors (response rate: 39.1 %) and 90 community members (Victoria, Australia). We examined people's top 10 overall (global) and Australian favourite animals, and conducted an in-depth exploration of recognition of, and preferences and support for, seven Australian endangered species identified as being at risk of extinction within the next decade, including: the leadbeater's possum (Gymnobe-lideus leadbeateri), eastern barred bandicoot (Perameles gunnii), helmeted honeyeater (Lichenostomus melanops cassidix), southern corroboree frog (Pseudophryne corroboree), Lord Howe Island (LHI) stick insect (Dryococelus australis), Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), and the orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster). Results indicate that the only Australian animals to feature in the overall top 10 favourite list were the kangaroo (ranked 9th for both sample groups) and koala (ranked 6th and 10th for the community and zoo sample, respectively). The Tasmanian devil had the highest rate of recognition (>86 %), in comparison to the remaining six species (1.2-7.3 % across both samples). Endangered species were not prominent in the top favourite Australian species. Australian endangered species' likeability ratings typically followed the pattern of mammals being most likeable (Tasmanian devil and leadbeater's possum), followed by birds, frogs, and insects (helmeted honeyeater, southern corroboree frog, and LHI stick insect). Importantly, for most endangered native species featured (4/7 and 6/7; zoo and community, respectively), simply being able to recognise species significantly (p <.05) increased peo-ple's willingness to support their conservation. Findings underscore several powerful opportunities for future conservation programs to contribute to Australian endangered species conservation by striving to increase public familiarity with Australian species most at risk of extinction.

AB  - Human activities in the oceans increase the extinction risk of marine megafauna. Interventions require an understanding of movement patterns and the spatiotemporal overlap with threats. We analysed the movement patterns of 33 white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) satellite-tagged in South Africa between 2012 and 2014 to investigate the influence of size, sex and season on movement patterns and the spatial and temporal overlap with longline and gillnet fisheries and marine protected areas (MPAs). We used a hidden Markov model to identify 'resident' and 'transient' movement states and investigate the effect of covariates on the transition probabilities between states. A model with sex, total length and season had the most support. Tagged sharks were more likely to be in a resident state near the coast and a transient state away from the coast, while the probability of finding a shark in the transient state increased with size. White sharks moved across vast areas of the southwest Indian Ocean, emphasising the need for a regional management plan. White sharks overlapped with longline and gillnet fisheries within 25% of South Africa's Exclusive Economic Zone and spent 15% of their time exposed to these fisheries during the study period. The demersal shark longline fishery had the highest relative spatial and temporal overlap, followed by the pelagic longline fishery and the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) shark nets and drumlines. However, the KZN shark nets and drumlines reported the highest white shark catches, emphasising the need to combine shark movement and fishing effort with reliable catch records to assess risks to shark populations accurately. White shark exposure to shark nets and drumlines, by movement state, sex and maturity status, corresponded with the catch composition of the fishery, providing support for a meaningful exposure risk estimate. White sharks spent significantly more time in MPAs than expected by chance, likely due to increased prey abundance or less disturbance, suggesting that MPAs can benefit large, mobile marine megafauna. Conservation of white sharks in Southern Africa can be improved by implementing non-lethal solutions to beach safety, increasing the observer coverage in fisheries, and continued monitoring of movement patterns and existing and emerging threats.

AB  - Estimating the abundance and density of mountain ungulates is difficult because of rugged and remote terrain, high elevations, and rapidly changing weather. Helicopter surveys could overcome these problems, but researchers have seldom applied helicopter-based survey methods at large spatial scales in mountain terrain. We used helicopters to count introduced Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus) at 117 plots, each of 4 km(2), in New Zealand's Southern Alps during 2016-2019. The sampling frame was 7,844 km(2) and we located the plots at the vertices of an 8-km grid superimposed over the sampling frame (i.e., a systematic random sampling design). We conducted 3 repeat counts at each plot during summer-autumn. We used the repeat counts to estimate tahr abundance and density, corrected for imperfect detection, using a dynamic N-mixture model for open populations. We estimated the population of tahr in the sampling frame using design-based, finite sampling methods and model-based inference procedures. The mean estimated density of tahr on each plot varied from zero to 31.7 tahr/km(2). The mean densities of tahr varied among management units, ranging from 0.3 to 10.7 tahr/km(2), and exceeded specified intervention densities in 6 of the 7 management units. The total design-based estimate of tahr abundance in the sampling frame was 34,500 (95% CI = 27,750-42,900), with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.11. The corresponding model-based estimate of total abundance was similar (34,550, 95% CI = 30,250-38,700) but was substantially more precise (CV = 0.06) than the design-based estimate. The precision of the estimates for the individual management units was also better than that of the design-based estimates, with CVs of <0.20 for all but 1 management unit. Our study provides a repeatable method for sampling mountain ungulates. More generally, robust estimation of abundance and density of mountain ungulates is possible by combining aerial surveys and open population models with an objective, probabilistic sampling design.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries (SSF) are often considered sustainable; but comprise 95% of global fishers and cumulatively evoke substantial ecosystem impacts that include collateral mortalities. Marine mammals and sea turtles are particularly vulnerable to SSF and have been the focus of conservation strategies. However, many strategies have fallen short of objectives. This study aimed to elucidate and help resolve associated issues by: compiling global efforts to mitigate marine-mammal and sea-turtle bycatches/fishing mortalities among SSF; identifying successful outcomes and influencing factors; and then suggesting steps for mitigating remaining problems. Among 150 articles, there was exponential temporal output, with gillnets the most studied gear (67%). Approximately 71% of all publications proposed mitigation measures but of these, efficacy was assessed in fewer than 2/3. While essential for conservation, community engagement was poorly initiated-although relevant studies have increased in the last decade, which may be correlated with studies describing management approaches instead of typical bycatch assessments. Mitigation measures were assessed in a 'strength-weaknesses-opportunities-and-threats' analysis. Mitigation measures should benefit multiple species ('strengths'), avoid high costs/maintenance ('weaknesses'), be supported by community engagement and governmental aid/enforcement ('opportunities'), and consider non-compliance ('threats'). Collateral mortalities can be reduced among SSF, but regional adoption of technology requires impetus that is best achieved via community engagement.

AB  - Simple Summary North American grassland birds evolved with American bison (Bison bison), until overhunting drove bison to near-extinction > 150 years ago. Bison have now been reintroduced to many areas that provide important nesting habitat for grassland birds, which are now among the most rapidly declining birds in North America. However, little is known about bison interactions with birds such as Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), obligate grassland nesting songbirds of conservation concern. Using data collected over an 18-year period, we assessed the effects of bison reintroduction, together with other land management and climate factors, on Bobolinks in a private conservation area comprising 24 km(2) of native grasslands in the North American Great Plains. In grasslands where bison were reintroduced, Bobolink abundance (adult numbers) declined by 62%, and productivity (juvenile numbers) declined by 84%. By contrast, Bobolink populations remained stable over the same time period in adjacent grasslands where bison were not reintroduced. Bobolink abundance and productivity increased in years following warmer and wetter winters, but nevertheless declined over time in grasslands where the bison population doubled. Where bison are reintroduced and confined in high densities, overgrazing, trampling, and related impacts may drive severe declines in Bobolinks and other grassland birds of conservation concern. Among the most rapidly declining birds in continental North America, grassland birds evolved with American bison (Bison bison) until bison nearly became extinct due to overhunting. Bison populations have subsequently rebounded due to reintroductions on conservation lands, but the impacts of bison on grassland nesting birds remain largely unknown. We investigated how bison reintroduction, together with other land management and climate factors, affected breeding populations of a grassland bird species of conservation concern, the Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus). We quantified population changes in Bobolinks over an 18-year period in conservation grasslands where bison were reintroduced, compared with adjacent grasslands grazed by cattle and where hay was harvested after the bird breeding season. Four years after bison reintroduction, the bison population in the study area had doubled, while Bobolink abundance declined 62% and productivity declined 84%. Our findings suggest that bison reintroduction as a conservation strategy may be counterproductive in grassland fragments where overgrazing, trampling, and other negative impacts drive declines in grassland breeding birds. Where bird conservation is an objective, small grassland reserves may therefore be inappropriate sites for bison reintroduction. To maximize conservation benefits to birds, land managers should prioritize protecting grassland birds from disturbance during the bird breeding season.

AB  - Increases in the frequency, intensity and/or diversity of disturbances affecting coral reefs are leading to concerns; some reefs will be overgrown by macroalgae. While numerous studies, particularly in the Pacific, have used macroalgal assays to quantify the rates and agents of herbivory of Sargassum, little is known of the capacity of reef fishes to reduce biomass of Lobophora, a common alga in macroalgal-dominated areas. The aim of this study was to determine the relative palatability of Lobophora to local herbivorous assemblages across two inshore reefs (Havannah Island and Orpheus Island) in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. Multiple choice macroalgal assays were deployed on the reef crest on each reef to determine the relative palatability of three macroalgae taxa: Lobophora, Sargassum and Padina. Additional Lobophora-only assays were deployed on the reef crest at Orpheus Island. Overall, the average reduction in macroalgal biomass was greater at Orpheus Island (25.3 g/3 h, pooled across macroalgae taxa) compared to Havannah Island (5.0 g/3 h), with the reduction in Lobophora biomass (0.3-1.5 g/3 h) being significantly lower than Sargassum (4.7-19.1 g/3 h) at both reefs. The reduction in Lobophora biomass at Orpheus Island was consistently low, whether presented in multiple choice (1.5 g/3 h) or Lobophora-only assays (1.7 g/3 h). Video observations revealed that four species of herbivorous fish (Kyphosis vaigiensis, Naso unicornis, Siganus doliatus, and Siganus canaliculatus) were responsible for the majority of the bites recorded on algae. Despite differences in the relative importance of these four species between islands, all four species took more bites from the Sargassum than Lobophora. The limited susceptibility of adult Lobophora to local herbivorous fish assemblages over short (3 h) temporal scales may play a role in the persistence of Lobophora-dominated areas on inshore reefs of the GBR. Future investigations over longer temporal scales and under different contexts are required to fully assess the susceptibility of Lobophora to herbivores.

AB  - When a population is isolated and composed of few individuals, genetic drift is the paramount evolutionary force and results in the loss of genetic diversity. Inbreeding might also occur, resulting in genomic regions that are identical by descent, manifesting as runs of homozygosity (ROHs) and the expression of recessive traits. Likewise, the genes underlying traits of interest can be revealed by comparing fixed SNPs and divergent haplotypes between affected and unaffected individuals. Populations of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon (SPM, France) have high incidences of leucism and malocclusions, both considered genetic defects; on the Florida Keys islands (USA) deer exhibit smaller body sizes, a polygenic trait. Here we aimed to reconstruct island demography and identify the genes associated with these traits in a pseudo case-control design. The two island populations showed reduced levels of genomic diversity and a build-up of deleterious mutations compared to mainland deer; there was also significant genome-wide divergence in Key deer. Key deer showed higher inbreeding levels, but not longer ROHs, consistent with long-term isolation. We identified multiple trait-related genes in ROHs including LAMTOR2 which has links to pigmentation changes, and NPVF which is linked to craniofacial abnormalities. Our mixed approach of linking ROHs, fixed SNPs and haplotypes matched a high number (similar to 50) of a-priori body size candidate genes in Key deer. This suite of biomarkers and candidate genes should prove useful for population monitoring, noting all three phenotypes show patterns consistent with a complex trait and non-Mendelian inheritance.

AB  - The Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx, Pallas 1777) once roamed the Middle Eastern deserts, but went extinct in the wild by 1972. More than 30 years after re-introduction programs were implemented the oryx is still classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Its poor reproductive performance was determined to be nutrition-related, and the availability of tannin-rich acacia browse has been crucial for the oryx in compensating for unpredictable grass production. Faecal N (FN) is an ubiquitous estimate of nutritional status, but its interpretation depends on dietary tannins that bind with proteins in the gastro-intestinal tract. Using three captive male oryx fed diets varying in the percentage of tannin-rich Acacacia tortilis pods, we demonstrated that dietary polyethylene-glycol binding tannins (PEG-b-T) were partly recovered in faeces and that faecal PEG-b-T represented qualitative evidence of browsing. Faecal PEG-b-T and FN were positively correlated, but we found no relationship between the dietary percentages of acacia pods, dietary protein, PEG-b-T, in vitro dry matter digestibility, and FN. Beyond the effect of dietary tannins, where the provision of crude protein and energy are sufficient for maintenance, efficient urea recycling might compromise the value of FN as an estimate of dietary status in oryx.

AB  - Herbivores form an important link in the transfer of energy within a food web and are strongly influenced by bottom-up trophic cascades. Current hypotheses suggest that herbivore consumption and impact on plants should scale positively with plant resource availability. However, depending on the effect of resources on plant quantity and quality, herbivore impact may vary with different types of resources. We test four alternative hypotheses for the relationship between plant biomass, herbivore impact on plant biomass and plant resource gradients, each based on how resources might affect plant abundance and quality to herbivores. We measured plant biomass for four non-consecutive years in a long-term grazing exclosure experiment in the Serengeti National Park that includes seven sites that vary substantially in rainfall and soil and plant nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Our data supported the hypothesis that herbivore impact is controlled by plant quality, in this case driven by plant P, as herbivore effects on biomass decreased with higher rainfall but increased with greater plant P, but not N content. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental study to indicate that wild mammalian herbivory is associated with P availability rather than N. Synthesis. Our results suggest that P, in addition to water and N, may play a more important role in driving trophic interactions in terrestrial systems than previously realized. Given the uncertainties in rainfall due to climate change and increasing anthropogenic manipulations of global N and P cycles, our findings emphasize the need to consider multiple resources for understanding how trophic interactions might be influenced by environmental variables.

AB  - Public support is often instrumental for restoring large mammals to landscapes where they have been extirpated. Effective conservation planning likely often hinges on wildlife managers understanding and reflecting the values and beliefs of their constituencies. Yet, comparative views of wildlife managers and the public or key interest groups are largely untested. As a prelude to developing a management plan for reintroduced bison (Bison bison) in Yukon, Canada, we compared views of the public, hunters, and wildlife managers, using a pre-tested questionnaire with most questions based on a 5-point Likert scale. We tested whether managers differed with respect to their values and beliefs pertaining to bison management compared to the public and hunters. Additionally, we used a Potential for Conflict Index(2) approach to assess the acceptability of potential management actions by these three groups to hypothetical scenarios. Our main findings were that (i) respondents with higher anthropocentric and ecocentric views of bison were more accepting of population growth; (ii) respondents that believed bison or hunters had created ecological or social impacts were less accepting of an increased bison population; (iii) means differed significantly between groups for most questions, with key differences being a lack of acceptability of "doing nothing" as a management option by the public, and "reducing harvest opportunities" by hunters-however, there were few polarized views on bison management options; and (iv) PCI2 values were often moderate (0.21-0.50) within groups, indicating a lack of consensus on views about the acceptability of management options. A low degree of consensus between or within groups is a hallmark of a potential for conflict, and revealing low levels of consensus between and within groups can facilitate understanding where increased communication between managers and their constituencies is needed. Our research provides a case study of wildlife managers in the Yukon and demonstrates that they reflect reasonably well the public and hunters regarding bison management. This is likely because Yukon bison managers are an inclusive group that is largely community based. That said, there were often significant differences in the degree to which all three groups agreed on bison management options. Within the context of species conservation planning, similar research can provide an important test on congruence between views of wildlife managers and their constituencies. We recommend similar assessments when key decisions need to be made by wildlife managers, particularly on potentially volatile issues that may not be broadly supported.

AB  - Mob-grazing involves maintaining high densities of livestock for short periods so that most plants are either eaten or trampled, followed by long rest periods. This practice has been proposed as a mechanism to increase soil carbon (C) storage and range quality. However, mob-grazing has not universally achieved these objectives, possibly because many factors influence the effects of grazing on soil C dynamics and vegetation. This study examines factors that may mediate grazing impacts on soil C by comparing plant cover and the seasonal dynamics of roots, soil variables, and mycorrhizal fungal hyphae in experimental plots treated with traditional grazing, annual mob-grazing or no grazing for 18 yr. Root and soil variables were measured directly underneath a C-4 grass, a C-3 grass, and a forb up to 5 xduring a 13-mo period. Mob-grazing did not influence total soil C, but it significantly increased soil organic matter (SOM), fine particulate organic matter, and nitrogen-15 (delta N-15). Furthermore, mob-grazing increased soil compaction, decreased soil aggregate stability, decreased soil moisture, and tended to increase the abundance of two invasive plant species: Salsola tragus and Bromus tectorum. Soil compaction, soil aggregate stability, root biomass, particulate organic matter, and percent soil C and N varied significantly across seasons and among plant species. The density of mycorrhizal fungal hyphae varied with season but not with grazing treatment. A significant grazing by date interaction in root biomass and soil carbon-13 (delta C-13) suggests that root dieback and inputs of pulverized plant material with a higher delta C-13 signature could be the source of higher SOM in mob-grazed plots. Compared with ungrazed plots, traditionally grazed plots had higher SOM without the adverse impacts on vegetation and soil properties observed in the mob-grazed plots. No single management strategy is universally beneficial. Range managers should carefully weigh the pros and cons of mob-grazing because, although it can increase SOM in surface soils, it may also negatively impact soil structure and composition of vegetation.

AB  - Controversy exists as to whether the Pleistocene vegetation in northern Sundaland was dominated by lowland tropical grasslands or rainforests, due to limited palaeoecological evidence recorded from the region. We describe a new Pleistocene large mammal fauna from Tham Kra Duk, a cave in the Tham Phedan mountain, Nakhon Si Thammarat Province in Peninsular Thailand, with emphasis on its palaeoecological and palaeoenvironmental investigations using the stable isotope analysis of mammalian tooth enamel. The fossil site has yielded at least nine mammalian taxa almost comparable to late middle to latest Pleistocene faunas in the mainland, thus suggesting the same biogeographic mammal elements with a range extension south of the Kra Isthmus. The stable isotope results indicate that mixed woodland to grassland ecosystems were dominated by C-4 vegetation in the area. This supports the assumption that the expansion of Pleistocene tropical savanna ecosystems might have held the key to facilitating the southward distribution range of grazing mammals such as gaurs and Himalayan gorals into the Thai-Malay Peninsula. The presence of the Tham Kra Duk fauna was probably linked to some major biogeographic events of Pleistocene hominin and mammal migration through the land-bridge peninsula into the islands of Southeast Asia during a period of glaciation.

AB  - Prescribed fire is a land management practice utilized in fire-adapted ecosystems to reduce wildfire risks, control invasive, exotic and woody plant species, enhance productivity and biodiversity, and share knowledge of land and culture. Fire exclusion has been the dominant management regime in western Canada since colonization. Efforts to reintroduce prescribed fire often face complex obstacles. The purpose of this research was to evaluate and compare organizational strategies for restoring fire as a land management process in grasslands of Saskatchewan. Agency practitioners with a range of experience in prescribed fire attended a workshop including presentations on agency practices and burn plan reviews. Workshop discussion was recorded, and themes were categorized and summarized. Common themes stressed the importance of access to education and training, information sharing and public engagement. Agencies were limited by institutional and jurisdictional barriers, liability concerns, weather and site complexities and had developed divergent strategies in response. Established programs with trained personnel and investment of significant funds accomplished the largest and most complex areas burned. In contrast, programmes with limited funding used a low-cost collaborative approach and completed frequent small burns. Solution. In response to the limitations to prescribed fire identified in the workshops, the Canadian Prairies Prescribed Fire Exchange was formed in 2021 to support interagency cooperation. The success of this organization between 2021 and 2024 emphasizes the importance of collaboration to overcome barriers, build successful programmes and accomplish shared conservation goals.

AB  - Arizona pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) population numbers have declined over the last century due to unregulated-harvest, population fragmentation, urban expansion, and habitat loss. Captive breeding, reintroductions, and translocations have helped to curb decline and boost population numbers of the endangered Sonoran subspecies (A. a. sonoriensis). To assess the effect of on-going management actions on the Sonoran subspecies, we collected multi-locus genotype data and performed tests of genetic differentiation and population structure in comparison to the non-endangered American subspecies (A. a. americana). We provide updated estimates of genetic diversity and relatedness to serve as a benchmark for future management toward further recovery of Sonoran pronghorn. Management actions have upheld distinction between the two subspecies in Arizona and stemmed further genetic diversity loss while avoiding an increase in inbreeding within the captive-bred Sonoran population.

AB  - Recent advances in biotelemetry allow monitoring of large mammals with varying neck sizes across multiple ecological phases (e.g., summer survival, dispersal, winter habitat use). Current collar technologies allow for use on neonatal ungulates such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). However, assessment of the function and overall retention of recent technology is warranted. Our objectives were to evaluate the retention rates of collar designs, determine factors affecting retention (e.g., mass, sex), and assess global positioning system (GPS) collar function (e.g., fix success rate, mean linear error) on wild neonatal deer in grassland and forested habitat types. We fit 75 (39 females, 36 males) and 82 (33 females, 49 males) white-tailed deer fawns with expandable GPS collars of 2 different collar designs 2021 (V1) and 2022 (V2), respectively. Collar retention issues included caught on fences, broken collar, and premature expansion. Collar retention at 3 months of age was 88% and 91% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, declining to 41% and 59% by 1 year of age. Older fawns at capture were less likely to retain their collar, such that for every 1 day increase in fawn age at capture, the odds of collar failure increased by 52%. We found no evidence that sex or birth size affected retention. Fix success rate was high (similar to 97%) and showed no evidence of variation by canopy cover. However, location error was greater (beta = -7.7, 95% CI = -5.92--9.39) in forested ((x) over bar = 12.7 m) versus grassland ((x) over bar = 5.1 m) habitat type. Both collar designs (V1, V2) functioned well and would allow for assessing spring and summer survival and cause-specific mortality for fawns collared at birth. However, collar failures often occurred after 6 months of age, which may reduce sample sizes necessary to examine dispersal, migration, and first year survival. We recommend researchers consider their specific ecological questions (e.g., summer survival, dispersal) and account for potential retention issues (e.g., barbed-wire fences, thick cover) when determining sample size. We also recommend continued interaction with collar companies to refine collar designs and enhance function of neonatal expandable collars.

AB  - Aim The body size of marine megafauna can influence population dynamics because larger females have disproportionally greater reproductive output. We explored how this size scaling relationship can affect predictions of population size structure in nesting sea turtles by combining a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis with a long-term field nesting survey. Location Global (meta-analysis) and Malaysia (field survey). Time period Present. Major taxa studied Sea turtles. Methods We extracted body size and reproductive parameters of all sea turtle species from the literature and estimated the reproductive-energy output using allometric models. We then examined the relationship between body size and the proportion of protected nesting beaches by country as an indicator of conservation efforts on body size. Long-term monitoring (1993-2019) of body size and nesting data on green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from Redang Island (Malaysia) was used to examine temporal changes in body size and fecundity and to test whether the size scaling of fecundity was isometric (linear) or allometric (curvilinear). Results We show that the total reproductive-energy output of larger nesting females was, on average, disproportionately greater in all sea turtle species. We found no strong correlations for countries with a higher proportion of protected nesting sites with female size. Finally, we showed that scaling-derived calculations of population-level yearly reproductive output in the green turtle population from Redang Island were more accurate when using a hyperallometric (rather than an isometric) relationship at the individual level. Main conclusions Understanding ecosystem function and conservation effort requires accurate predictions of population trends. Our findings highlight the necessity to account for scaling effects of body size in predicting anthropogenically mediated population shifts, and the need to protect large females in order to facilitate effective population replenishment.

AB  - Introduction Megaprojects are strategically envisioned to boost regional development. Still, they drive ecosystem changes that generate ecological impacts in space and time beyond construction sites, particularly those established in rural regions, as their economic goals often trigger broader landuse changes. These distal ecological impacts are frequently overlooked, but their evaluation is critical to assess changes in ecosystem services that provide quality of life to the local people. To understand the effects on ecosystem services, this study analyzed both the proximal and distal impacts of the "Tren Maya" railroad megaproject.Methods Using InVest models, which provide spatial quantitative analysis using land use information, among other variables. We evaluated three ecosystem services: habitat quality, pollination, and carbon sequestration across the Yucat & aacute;n Peninsula, Mexico. We assessed historical (2002) and recent (2017) ecosystem services. We projected three scenarios to 2050: (a) future without train, land use change using previous trends, (b) proximal impacts of the Tren Maya, and (c) combined proximal and distal impacts of the Tren Maya.Results Results show significant declines of all evaluated ecosystem services in the three future scenarios, with the most pronounced reductions with distal impacts. Ecosystem types have different impacts, where tropical rainforests and tropical dry forest are the most affected. Geographically, the northwestern region of the Peninsula (the most populated) is more affected, while protected areas in the southern region mitigate some impacts.Discussion The analysis shows that distal impacts are more significant in the habitat quality than the other two ecosystem services evaluated. Our findings underscore the need for megaproject evaluations to incorporate both proximal and distal impacts to ensure sustainable development.

AB  - The recent decline of Phragmites australis stands in the Mississippi River Delta is due, in part, to damage from herbivory by the non-native roseau cane scale, Nipponaclerda biwakoensis. In Louisiana, P. australis communities, known locally as roseau cane, protect the marsh ecosystem from erosion and storm-related impacts, stabilize shipping channels, and shield oil and inland infrastructure. Intense infestations by N. biwakoensis have contributed to widespread dieback of reeds in this region since 2016. Identifying suitable biological control agents from the source population is key to managing the invasive population of N. biwakoensis and protecting the delicate marsh ecosystem. Therefore, we used mitochondrial COI sequence data, drawn from collections of N. biwakoensis spanning the native and invasive range, to identify the origin of the established population in Louisiana and Texas. Network analysis using TCS 1.21 revealed a rich diversity of 57 unique COI haplotypes distributed across the native range in East Asia. Relationships among the sampled haplotypes indicate that N. biwakoensis was likely introduced to the United States from northeastern China. Specimens from the USA are nested among a group of haplotypes all originating from China, and the samples belong to a haplotype that was otherwise only collected in Beijing and Hebei. In contrast, modeling of habitat suitability based on host plant records from across East Asia, using MaxEnt 3.4.4, identified southeastern China as the best location to search for potential natural enemies to match the climatic conditions in the Mississippi River Delta. These two pieces of evidence provide critical guidance to focus future biological control efforts, and we discuss the importance of examining both genetic and environmental data when searching for potential biological control agents. Additionally, we identified two cryptic species of Nipponaclerda on Phragmites, one in Japan and another in Viet Nam. This research offers new depths of perspective on population structure for a rarely studied group of scale insects, the flat grass scales (Aclerdidae). Together the evaluation of scale insect genetics and ecological niche modeling will optimize foreign exploration efforts for biological control agents.

AB  - Context The decline of the greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis), or Ngarlgumirdi (Yawuru), like other critical-weight range Australian mammals, is believed to be primarily due to the synergetic impacts of predation by feral cats and foxes, habitat disturbance caused by large introduced herbivores, and increases in the frequency and intensity of wildfires. Although it has been demonstrated that low-intensity prescribed burning mosaics in some habitats have the potential to benefit mammals, including Ngarlgumirdi, by creating habitat with sufficient vegetation cover, the contributions of specific fire-mosaic attributes to Ngarlgumirdi persistence remain unclear. Aims To elucidate the impacts of fire-mosaic attributes on the occupancy of Ngarlgumirdi on the Dampier Peninsula. Methods We used 2-ha sign-plot data collected by four Indigenous Ranger groups, in combination with 20 years of satellite-derived fire-history information to investigate the multiscale impacts of fire attributes on Ngarlgumirdi and feral cats (Felis catus) on the Dampier Peninsula in the West Kimberley region, a large, unfenced landscape in the most fire-prone section of the Ngarlgumirdi's current range. Key results We found that Ngarlgumirdi was more common in areas that had a higher proportion of habitat that had not burnt for at least 3 years, whereas feral cats were less prevalent in these areas. Similarly, Ngarlgumirdi was less likely to occur in landscapes affected by frequent fires, whereas cats were more common there. Conclusions Our findings have highlighted the importance of decreasing fire frequency and increasing the extent of long-unburnt habitats (>3 years) for preserving Ngarlgumirdi on the Dampier Peninsula and mitigating ecological damage inflicted by feral cats. Findings were consistent across spatial scales (1-, 3-, 5- and 10-km radius from each monitoring site). Implications These results have demonstrated the potential of fire management to increase native species resilience in the absence of direct feral cat control methods. Further, they support a recent cross-tenure initiative led by Traditional Owners to implement fire management that aims to reduce large, frequent high-severity wildfires and increase areas of long-unburnt vegetation on the Dampier Peninsula.

AB  - Simple Summary Long-term monitoring of the Alpine musk deer (AMD, Moschus chrysogaster) population is essential in any human-dominated landscape as their population is globally showing a declining trend due to high deforestation rates, hunting pressure, and human disturbance. In view of that, the AMD population was monitored in Xinglong Mountain Nature Reserve (XMNNR), as their past high-density distribution areas, northwest of China, using a camera trap between September 2018 and August 2020. The results showed that AMD strongly spatial temporal avoids livestock but gradually adjusts to human activities. Compared to the previous report, AMD distributes artificial forests that are not confined to the areas reported but also cover other potential areas.
   Comprehension of whether human and livestock presence affects wildlife activity is a prerequisite for the planning and management of humans and livestock in protected areas. Xinglong Mountain Nature Reserve (XMNNR) in northwest China, as a green island in a semi-arid mountain ecosystem, is one of the scattered and isolated areas for Alpine musk deer (AMD), an endangered species. AMD cohabits their latent habitat area with foraging livestock and humans. Hence, habitat management within and outside the distribution areas is crucial for the effective conservation of AMD. We applied camera traps to a dataset of 2 years (September 2018-August 2020) to explore seasonal activity patterns and habitat use and assess the impacts of AMD habits in XMNNR. We investigated AMD responses to livestock grazing and human activities and provided effective strategies for AMD conservation. We applied MaxENT modeling to predict the distribution size under current conditions. The activity patterns of the AMD vary among seasons. The optimum habitat average distance to cultivated land ranges of AMD (150 similar to 3300 m during grass period/100 similar to 3200 m during withered grass period), distances to the residential area ranges (500 similar to 5700 m during the grass period/1000 similar to 5300 m during the withered grass period), elevation ranges (2350 similar to 3400 m during the grass period/2360 similar to 3170 m during the withered grass period), aspect ranges (0 similar to 50 degrees and 270 similar to 360 degrees), normalized vegetation index ranges (0.64 similar to 0.72 during the grass period/0.14 similar to 0.60 during the withered grass period), and land cover types (forest, shrub, and grassland). Results present that the predicted distributions of AMD were not confined to the areas reported but also covered other potential areas. The results provide evidence of strong spatial-temporal avoidance of AMD in livestock, but gradually adjusting to human activities. These camera trap datasets may open new opportunities for species conservation in much wider tracts, such as human-dominated landscapes, and may offer guidance and mitigate impacts from livestock, as well as increase artificial forest planting and strengthen the investigation of the potential population resources of AMD.

AB  - Forests worldwide are experiencing increasingly intense biotic disturbances; however, assessing impacts of these disturbances is challenging due to the diverse range of organisms involved and the complex interactions among them. This particularly applies to invasive species, which can greatly alter ecological processes in their invaded territories. Here we focus on the pine wood nematode (PWN, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus), an invasive pathogen that has caused extensive mortality of pines in East Asia and more recently has invaded southern Europe. It is expected to expand its range into continental Europe with heavy impacts possible. Given the unknown dynamics of PWN in continental Europe, we reviewed laboratory and field experiments conducted in Asia and southern Europe to parameterize the main components of PWN biology and host-pathogen interactions in the Biotic Disturbance Engine (BITE), a model designed to implement a variety of forest biotic agents, from fungi to large herbivores. To simulate dynamically changing host availability and conditions, BITE was coupled with the forest landscape model iLand. The potential impacts of introducing PWN were assessed in a Central European forest landscape (40,928 ha), likely within PWN's reach in future decades. A parameter sensitivity analysis indicated a substantial influence of factors related to dispersal, colonization, and vegetation impact, whereas parameters related to population growth manifested a minor effect. Selection of different assumptions about biological processes resulted in differential timing and size of the main mortality wave, eliminating 40%-95% of pine trees within 100 years post-introduction, with a maximum annual carbon loss between 1.3% and 4.2%. PWN-induced tree mortality reduced the Gross Primary Productivity, increased heterotrophic respiration, and generated a distinct legacy sink effect in the recovery period. This assessment has corroborated the ecological plausibility of the simulated dynamics and highlighted the need for new strategies to navigate the substantial uncertainty in the agent's biology and population dynamics.

AB  - Hubei Shishou Milu National Nature Reserve is an ideal place to restore the wild population of Pere David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus). Understanding foraging ecology and diet composition is essential for assessing population development or establishing long-term effective conservation measures for endangered species. However, little is known about the diet composition of Pere David's deer and its diet selection mechanism. In this study, we used stable isotope technology to investigate the diet composition of Pere David's deer according to various tissues (i.e., fur, muscle, liver, heart, and feces) and seasons, and evaluated the correlation between the nutrient composition of plants and diet composition. Bayesian isotope analysis showed that the autumn and winter diet estimated by fur and fecal samples indicated a diet dominated by C-3 grasses (42.7%-57.2%, mean), while the summer diet estimated by muscle and liver samples was dominated by C-3 forbs (30.9%-41.6%, mean). The Pearson correlation test indicated that the contribution of winter diet composition reflected by fur and fecal samples was associated with correlations with crude protein (r = .666, p < .01) and soluble sugars (r = .695, p < .01). The results indicated that crude protein and soluble sugars were important factors influencing the winter diet selection of Pere David's deer. In the context of the current reintroduction facing many challenges, such as habitat fragmentation, wetland degradation, and human disturbance, comprehensively evaluating the diet selection mechanism of Pere David's deer under different resource specificities and temporal changes should be considered in the future.

AB  - The aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) is a Vulnerable bovid endemic of North Africa. Although legally protected in almost every country of its native distribution, the aoudad continues to be hunted for meat and trophy in both North Africa and the countries where it has been introduced. The species was subject to past translocations planned irrespectively of the genetic diversity and local adaptations of source and receiving populations, and no management or conservation units have ever been designed. We aim to provide here important insights on the taxonomy of the aoudad subspecies and the genetic diversity of most of its wild and captive populations. We collected 127 invasive and non-invasive samples from five of the six subspecies of aoudad recognized to date. We could successfully retrieve genetic data for 74 samples. Of those, 36 provided both nuclear (11 microsatellites) and mitochondrial (Cyt-b) data, 31 just nuclear data, and six just mitochondrial data. We implement Bayesian approaches to infer the population structure and phylogenetic relationships between the different populations/subspecies and backtrack the maternal lineages of introduced individuals in European populations. Our results support the presence of four genetically different wild populations, corresponding to three distinct mitochondrial lineages plus a fourth group restricted to Egypt identified by the nuclear markers. We also provide genetic evidence on the affiliation of some introduced European populations with respect to the native ones. The genetic diversity instead of variation within all wild populations was low. This might be a consequence of small effective population size and/or high inbreeding degree, probably related to hunting, decline in habitat availability and quality (i.e. overgrazing, and frequent drought), and high inbreeding degree. Our results provide important information for the aoudad conservation, including reintroductions and reinforcement actions of wild populations, and the exchange of individuals among captive stocks.

AB  - Fishing-down-marine-food-webs has resulted in alarming declines of various species worldwide. Benthic rays are one examples of such overexploited species. On tidal flats, these rays are highly abundant and play an ecologically important role. They use tidal flats as refuge, feeding and resting grounds, during which they bury into the sediment, which results in sediment bioturbation. Changes in bioturbation intensity, following ray removal, may affect the biogeomorphology of tidal flats with possible cascading effects on the macrozoobenthic community. However, it is poorly understood how these indirect effects could influence ecosystem function. We therefore studied the geomorphic impact of benthic rays (specifically the pearl whipray/stingray Fontitrygon margaritella) on the tropical tidal flats of the Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau, on a landscape scale. We investigated 1) bioturbation rates by rays using drone and ground surveys, 2) the spatial distribution of ray pits on multiple tidal flats, 3) the impact of rays on sediment properties and macrozoobenthos by experimental exclusion (15 months). Benthic rays bioturbated 3.7 +/- 0.35% of the tidal flat's sediment surface per day over one single 24-h period, which equals a complete top-sediment-surface turnover every 27 days. The spatial distribution of ray pits was affected by tidal flat geomorphology since pits decayed faster at areas exposed to strong hydrodynamic forces. Predator exclusion altered sediment properties, leading to changes in sedimentation (- 17%) and erosion (- 43%) rates. In addition, macrozoobenthic species composition changed, marked by an increase in Capitellidae worms and a greater biomass of Malacostraca over time. These changes indicated substantial effects of ray bioturbation on the biotic and geomorphic landscape of tidal flats. Overall, we conclude that changing abundances of benthic rays can have clear landscape-wide geomorphological effects on intertidal ecosystems. These indirect consequences of fisheries should be incorporated in integrative management plans to preserve tidal flats and connected ecosystems.

AB  - Context. The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) sometimes occurs as an overabundant folivore in south-eastern Australia, where high-density populations have caused defoliation of preferred food trees, threatening habitat. Kangaroo Island, South Australia and Budj Bim National Park, Victoria, are two regions where such eruptive population dynamics have arisen. One way of mitigating their damage is through management via fertility control.
   Aims. This paper examines the outcomes of fertility control (surgical sterilisation and treatment with levonorgestrel implants) on breeding dynamics at the population level, using data obtained from two separate koala management programs conducted by State Government wildlife agencies, South Australia Department for Environment and Water and Parks Victoria.
   Methods. The relationships between female body condition, reproductive status, fertility control, age and population density were examined using linear mixed effects models. Population density (koalas/ha) was estimated using annual census data and modelled in a Bayesian framework.
   Key results. Body condition was a key influence on breeding success in female koalas, with sexual maturity being defined by both age and body condition, whereas the effect of reproductive experience was minimal. It is likely that reduced densities have led to decreased intraspecific competition for food resources and territory, leading to increased breeding success at one management site (BBNP) and by allowing females to begin breeding at a lower overall body condition. The reduction in densities to sustainable levels at both management sites, despite differing fertility-control methods, supports the use of the less invasive and more cost-effective levonorgestrel implants as the preferred fertility-control method.
   Conclusions. In addition to contraceptive effects, broad-scale fertility control may have resulted in a compensatory higher breeding success in the untreated population, possibly in response to decreasing densities, increased resource availability or behavioural responses to population management.

AB  - The record of mammal declines and extinctions inAustralia raises concerns regarding geographically restrictedand poorly known taxa. For many taxa, the existing data areinsufficient to assess their conservation status and informappropriate management. Concerns regarding the per-sistence of the subspecies of yellow-footed rock-wallabyPetrogale xanthopus celeris, which is endemic to Queens-land, have been expressed since thes because of redfoxVulpes vulpespredation, competition with feral goatsCapra hircusand land clearing. This rock-wallaby is rarelyobserved, occupies rugged mountain ranges and, prior toour surveys, had not been surveyed foryears. We sur-veyedsites across the range of this rock-wallaby during, including revisiting sites surveyed in thes-s and locations of historical records. We examined occurrence in relation to habitat variables and threats.Occupancy and abundance remained similar over time atmost sites. However, bythe subspecies had recolonizedareas in the north-east of its range where it had disappearedbetween surveys in thes ands, and three south-western subpopulations that were considered extinct inthes were rediscovered. Recolonization and increasesin abundance at numerous sites between thes ands are associated with declines in feral goat abundance,indicating dietary and habitat competition are majorthreats. Exclusion fences erected sincecould limitgenetic exchange between rock-wallaby subpopulationswhilst allowing domestic goats to be commercially grazed.Petrogale xanthopus celerisshould remain categorized as Vulnerable based on these ongoing threats. Repeated moni-toring approximately every decade should underpin manage-ment of this endemic taxon.

AB  - Hunting pressure alters the spatial ecology of many ungulate species. During hunting periods, game species often select areas that have reduced hunter accessibility by increasing use of forest cover, remaining farther from roads, or moving to private land as a means of refuge. Our objectives were to determine if elk (Cervus canadensis) in central Utah, USA, shifted distribution towards areas of refuge (private land) in response to hunting and whether allocating hunting permits to refuge areas could reduce selection of refugia by elk. We captured 445 elk between January 2015 and March 2017 on the Wasatch Front in central Utah and fitted each individual with a global positioning system collar. We used logistic regression models and Bayesian change point analyses to determine differences in daily use of public land in response to the addition of private-land hunting. We detected shifts in elk distribution at the beginning of the archery hunting season and during the rifle season, suggesting elk selected for private land as refuge from hunters. At the conclusion of the hunting season, we detected a shift back to public land. The addition of private-land hunting increased use of public land by elk during the rifle season (from 29% in 2015 to 41% in 2016). Our results show that the distribution of elk across a matrix of public and private land can be influenced by manipulating hunting pressure. Hunter access, the ability of hunters to access target game species, can be a concern in areas with private-land refuges. This can be particularly problematic when management strategies rely on hunter harvest to maintain population objectives; however, this problem can be mitigated by the introduction of hunting on private lands, if landowners provide hunter access.

AB  - Whilst the re-introduction of fire can contribute to biodiversity conservation in Fennoscandian forests, the effects on reindeer herding remain uncertain. To assess the short- and long-term effects of prescribed burning on lichen supply in a productive forest landscape, we developed a model simulating lichen biomass available for reindeer grazing, covering 300 years and 1500 pine stands, under different soil preparation scenarios, including different prescribed burning regimes and mechanical scarification. Our simulations revealed that burning 25-50% of yearly clear-cuts has the potential to stop, or even reverse, reindeer lichen decline at landscape scale after 70 years, greatly surpassing the short-term losses caused by burning. No burning or burning 5% of yearly clear-cuts, as required by the FSC certification, compounded the negative effects of fire suppression and scarification on lichen. Compared to the scenario with no soil preparation, all our simulations resulted in a continuous decrease of lichen supply in Lichen-type stands, indicating that any form of disturbance in these habitats can strongly limit future gains.

AB  - Estimates of the distribution and density of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana, 1850) were derived from a large-scale survey conducted during the austral summer in the Southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean and across the Scotia Sea in 2018-19, the '2018-19 Area 48 Survey'. Survey vessels were provided by Norway, the Association of Responsible Krill harvesting companies and Aker BioMarine AS, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Republic of Korea, and China. Survey design followed the transects of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources synoptic survey, carried out in 2000 and from regular national surveys performed in the South Atlantic sector by the U.S., China, Republic of Korea, Norway, and the U.K. The 2018-19 Area 48 Survey represents only the second large-scale survey performed in the area and this joint effort resulted in the largest ever total transect line (19,500 km) coverage carried out as one single exercise in the Southern Ocean. We delineated and integrated acoustic backscatter arising from krill swarms to produce distribution maps of krill areal biomass density and standing stock (biomass) estimates. Krill standing stock for the Area 48 was estimated to be 62.6 megatonnes (mean density of 30 g m(-)(2) over 2 million km(2)) with a sampling coefficient variation of 13%. The highest mean krill densities were found in the South Orkney Islands stratum (93.2 g m(-2)) and the lowest in the South Georgia Island stratum (6.4 g m(-2)). The krill densities across the strata compared to those found during the previous survey indicate some regional differences in distribution and biomass. It is currently not possible to assign any such differences or lack of differences between the two survey datasets to longer term trends in the environment, krill stocks or fishing pressure.

AB  - The domestication of animals is a major milestone in human history and has been studied in various fields. Pig domestication, in particular, has been widely studied, and it is believed that India is one of at least six domestication centers. However, there is a lack of systematic studies using high-resolution genetic markers, including complete mitogenomes, to investigate the domestication and genetic roots of pigs in India. In the present study, we investigated the origin and evolution of Indian pigs using mitochondrial genetic data to complement archaeological data sets. The phylogenetic status of Indian pig breeds was determined by analyzing all available mitochondrial data, incorporating a global data set of 239 mitogenomes. The Bayesian and maximum likelihood tree analyses unveiled at least eight haplogroups diverging from three main branches, two of which are geographically restricted to India. We propose that the North Indian domestic haplogroup might represent an independent in situ domestication event in North India, probably dating before similar to 5,000 YBP. An additional North East Indian domestic haplogroup is nested within a widespread Asian clade that also includes Indian mitogenomes from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands that diverged more recently from distinct East and Southeast Asian roots. In conclusion, we propose that North Indian farmers could have been responsible for the independent domestication of local wild boars giving rise to the current domestic lineage identified in North India. At least one additional domestic lineage arrived in India more recently and remained mainly localized in the northeast. Domestic mitogenomes from the Indian islands show a notable connection with pig populations from Vietnam, and their arrival might be related to Austroasiatic-speaking human populations. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the complex dynamics of pig domestication in India.

AB  - Tea trees (Camellia sinensis), a quintessential homestead agroforestry crop cultivated in over 60 countries, hold significant economic and social importance as a vital specialty cash crop. Accurate nationwide crop data is imperative for effective agricultural management and resource regulation. However, many regions grapple with a lack of agroforestry cash crop data, impeding sustainable development and poverty eradication, especially in economically underdeveloped countries. The large-scale mapping of tea plantations faces substantial limitations and challenges due to their sparse distribution compared to field crops, unfamiliar characteristics, and spectral confusion among various land cover types (e.g., forests, orchards, and farmlands). To address these challenges, we developed the Manual management And Phenolics substance-based Tea mapping (MAP-Tea) framework by harnessing Sentinel-1/2 time series images for automated tea plantation mapping. Tea trees, exhibiting higher phenolic content, evergreen characteristics, and multiple shoot sprouting, result in extensive canopy coverage, stable soil exposure, and radar backscatter signal interference from frequent picking activities. We developed three phenology-based indicators focusing on phenolic content, vegetation coverage, and canopy texture leveraging the temporal features of vegetation, pigments, soil, and radar backscattering. Characteristics of biochemical substance content and manual management measures were applied to tea mapping for the first time. The MAP-Tea framework successfully generated China's first updated 10 m resolution tea plantation map in 2022. It achieved an overall accuracy of 94.87% based on 16,712 reference samples, with a kappa coefficient of 0.83 and an F1 score of 85.63%. The tea trees are typically cultivated in mountainous and hilly areas with a relatively low planting density (averaging about 10%). Alpine tea trees exhibited a notably dense concentration and dominance, mainly found in regions with elevations ranging from 700 m to 2000 m and slopes between 2 degrees to 18 degrees. The areas with low altitudes and slopes hold the largest tea plantation area and output. As the slope increased, there was a gradual decline in the dominance of tea areas. The results suggest a good potential for the knowledge-based approaches, combining biochemical substance content and human activities, for national-scale tea plantation mapping in complex environment conditions and challenging landscapes, providing important reference significance for mapping other agroforestry crops. This study contributes significantly to advancing the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) considering the crucial role that agroforestry crops play in fostering economic growth and alleviating poverty. The first 10m national Tea tree data products in China with good accuracy (ChinaTea10m) are publicly accessed at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare .25047308.

AB  - Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) have experienced dramatic declines in both range and population size across Canada over the past century. Boreal caribou (R. t. caribou), 1 of the 12 Designatable Units, has lost approximately half of its historic range in the last 150 years, particularly along the southern edge of its distribution. Despite this overall northward contraction, some populations have persisted at the trailing range edge, over 150 km south of the continuous boreal caribou range in Ontario, along the coast and nearshore islands of Lake Superior. The population history of caribou along Lake Superior remains unclear. It appears that these caribou likely represent a remnant distribution at the trailing edge of the receding population of boreal caribou, but they may also exhibit local adaptation to the coastal environment. A better understanding of the population structure and history of caribou along Lake Superior is important for their conservation and management. Here, we use high-coverage whole genomes (N = 20) from boreal, eastern migratory, and barren-ground caribou sampled in Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec to investigate population structure and inbreeding histories. We discovered that caribou from the Lake Superior range form a distinct group but also found some evidence of gene flow with the continuous boreal caribou range. Notably, caribou along Lake Superior demonstrated relatively high levels of inbreeding (measured as runs of homozygosity; ROH) and genetic drift, which may contribute to the differentiation observed between ranges. Despite inbreeding, caribou along Lake Superior retained high heterozygosity, particularly in genomic regions without ROH. These results suggest that they present distinct genomic characteristics but also some level of gene flow with the continuous range. Our study provides key insights into the genomics of the southernmost range of caribou in Ontario, beginning to unravel the evolutionary history of these small, isolated caribou populations.

AB  - A severe marine heat wave (MHW) persisted in the California Current ecosystem from 2014 through 2016. The MHW featured record-high sea surface temperatures in 2015, with 2014 to 2016 being the warmest 3 yr period on record. Our decade-long (2010-2019) breeding and diet monitoring of the rhinoceros auklet Cerorhinca monocerata, a burrow-nesting seabird, at significant breeding colonies on Destruction Island (California Current) and Protection Island (Salish Sea) allowed us to compare reproductive and dietary responses to this MHW. Although the colonies are relatively close to each other, and their reproductive output is, on average, similar, the auklets' responses to the MHW differed. At Destruction Island, burrow occupancy rates were lower during the MHW (0.54 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.61 +/- 0.02 [mean +/- SE] in non-MHW years), suggesting that birds skipped breeding, but fledging success rates did not differ (0.85 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.89 +/- 0.03). At Protection Island, burrow occupancy remained at non-MHW levels (0.72 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.69 +/- 0.02), but reproductive success declined (0.71 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.82 +/- 0.02). Chick provisioning also showed different patterns. The energy (kJ) per bill load at Destruction Island showed no clear MHW effect, while at Protection Island, it was reduced. At the same time, bill-load prey item count rose at Protection Island, indicating increased foraging effort and/or a reduction in diet quality. Our results further suggest rhinoceros auklets may be more resilient than other seabird species to major climate perturbations. However, with MHWs predicted to become more frequent and severe, the auklets' ability to maintain these levels of breeding success will be tested.

AB  - Hunting directly impacts the population dynamics of ungulates and can have a significant effect on the quality of phenotypic traits such as horns or antlers. In Poland, following a demographic collapse in the 1990s and the introduction of a hunting ban in 2001, the population of moose (Alces alces) has increased from 1,800 to over 20,000 individuals, recolonising its former range. As the moose is a charismatic species and a popular subject for nature photography, we analysed changes in antler size and shape in this cervid between 2005 and 2021 based on photos of male moose and antler casts provided by photographers or available in social media. Our findings indicate that during the hunting ban, the probability of observing the cervina antler type significantly decreased over time, from 47% in 2012 to 28% in 2021. Meanwhile, the probability of observing the intermediate and palmate antler types significantly increased from 44 to 53% and from 9 to 19%, respectively. The mean number of tines significantly increased from 3.2 in 2005 to 4.7 in 2021, and the antler size index significantly increased from 3.4 to 3.9. The most likely mechanism behind the observed changes could be the ageing of a population released from hunting pressure. We also observed regional variation in antler size, which is likely related to differences in environmental conditions. Our study serves as an example of how passive citizen science can contribute to our understanding of ecological trends and the quantification of population patterns. It also has important implications for management of species affected by trophy hunting.

AB  - Natural habitat of the endangered Florida Key deer ( Odocoileus virginianus clavium) is limited to a portion of the lower Florida Keys, large parts of which have been altered by human development. A major reason the deer have survived there is its unique geology that provides surface access to underground freshwater lenses. Such water features provide the deer access to drinking water, however, historically many of the sites have been destroyed through human activity. We examined seasonal drinking water availability to the deer on multiple islands for 3.5 years from April 2019 through September 2022. We also examined the availability of anthropogenic drinking water sources linked to human habitation. Our results show that natural drinking water sources become extremely limited or non-existent during the region's dry season in large parts of the Key deer range. Anthropogenic freshwater sources in the form of air conditioning drips, garden ponds, water buckets and bird baths are much more numerous, and the deer utilize them regularly. We posit that the existing unavailability of natural drinking water sites is a prime factor driving the domestication of Key deer. This trend of Key deer dependence on humans will only increase as projected increased hurricane activity and sea level rise will negatively affect the freshwater lenses, and hence the number of permanent freshwater sites available to Florida Keys wildlife. The dependence trend could be slowed by management's readopting natural water source enhancement efforts and installation of water guzzlers as was done in the mid-2000 s but has not been continued since.

AB  - Megabentic non-crustacean invertebrates which play crucial important role in the ecosystem were spatiotemporally studied in an oligotrophic water mass of the eastern Mediterranean shelf-shelf break. The samples were collected with an Otter fishery trawl on three regions, each having five different seafloor depths. The samplings were repeated seasonally in four different months during year 2014-2015, being aimed to provide baseline ecological information on their bathymetric and seasonal distribution and biodiversity patterns. A total of 7 megabenthic non-crustacean phyla were found including 90 species composed mainly of 38 mollusks, 20 echinoderms, and 12 sponges. Three non-crustacean species recorded alien species for the Mediterranean Sea. Number of species for each phylum changed with the seafloor depth. Number of species increased overall from the shallow water to the intermediate water, and then decreased down to the shelf break. The westernmost Mediterranean Sea was incomparable so rich and high in the number of species, biomass and abundance as compared with the easternmost Mediterranean Sea. In general, abundance and biomass increased in summer and decreased in winter in the Mediterranean Sea, particularly at the shallower waters, continental shelf depending mainly on a series variety of organisms' behaviors and environmental conditions. The abundance of epifauna was differentiated by the status of the grounds: fishing and non-fishing grounds. Conomurex persicus changed remarkably the spatiotemporal trends in contrast to no regular seasonal pattern in the faunistic characters in very shallow waters after its introduction. The depth-related gradient was owing to a number of biogeochemical and physical factors interacted with sedimentary characters, light intensity, nutritional condition availability, and temperature. With an exception of few species, the characteristic species for spatio-temporal similarities, the species composition were rather different between the easternmost and westernmost Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - Spatial rarity is often used to predict extinction risk, but rarity can also occur temporally. Perhaps more relevant in the context of global change is whether a species is core to a community (persistent) or transient (intermittently present), with transient species often susceptible to human activities that reduce niche space. Using 5-12 yr of data on 1,447 plant species from 49 grasslands on five continents, we show that local abundance and species persistence under ambient conditions are both effective predictors of local extinction risk following experimental exclusion of grazers or addition of nutrients; persistence was a more powerful predictor than local abundance. While perturbations increased the risk of exclusion for low persistence and abundance species, transient but abundant species were also highly likely to be excluded from a perturbed plot relative to ambient conditions. Moreover, low persistence and low abundance species that were not excluded from perturbed plots tended to have a modest increase in abundance following perturbance. Last, even core species with high abundances had large decreases in persistence and increased losses in perturbed plots, threatening the long-term stability of these grasslands. Our results demonstrate that expanding the concept of rarity to include temporal dynamics, in addition to local abundance, more effectively predicts extinction risk in response to environmental change than either rarity axis predicts alone.

AB  - Deposits of seabird guano on marine shores have drawn the attention of companies and naturalists for centuries. Among notable effects, allochthonous energy/matter inputs by seabirds are responsible for shifts in ecosystem functioning next to colonies. Here, we used stable isotopes of nitrogen-15 (ratios of N-15:N-14, expressed as delta N-15) to trace guano incorporation in the intertidal reef community (fish and crab). The study areas were the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago (SPSPA), a remote and very small group of islets in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean, and two reference Atlantic islands where intertidal environments are not subject to the influence of guano. SPSPA intertidal reef fauna presented 3-7 parts per thousand higher delta N-15 values in comparison with local seabirds and with the intertidal reef fauna of reference islands. The intertidal food web of SPSPA appears supplemented by guano subsidies with carnivores, omnivores and herbivores N-15-enriched in relation to a local seabird. While no difference in intertidal biota delta N-15 values was detected between references sites, N-15-enrichement observed for SPSPA intertidal reef fauna is supported by guano subsidies. With emerged area < 0.02 km(2), SPSPA is one of the world's smallest archipelagos and only its main islet (Belmonte Island) has a few tidepools apt to be inhabited by fish. As guano readily drains into tidepools and reef crevices adjacent to the seabird colony, allochthonous nutrients become available and support habitat-restricted species in this small and isolated location.

AB  - Predicting the level of damage by deer browsing in young plantations is important for considering damage control measures. In this study, we examined a method for assessing the level of deer damage in young Sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) plantations with deer-proof fences by observing field signs of deer. First, a questionnaire survey was conducted to obtain information about the damage by deer browsing on planted trees and the extent of field signs, such as browsing marks and deer fecal pellets around the young plantations. The extent of field signs was recorded as qualitative data (i.e. "None", "A few", and "Many"). A multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) revealed a relationship between the extent of deer damage in young plantations and the presence of five field signs (browsing marks, bark stripping marks, fecal pellets, trails and tracks) around the young plantations. Based on coordinate values of each field sign obtained using the MCA, the extent of each field sign was scored, and the total value was calculated as the deer impact score (DISco). When the relationship between the DISco and the extent of deer damage to planted trees was subjected to a logistic regression analysis (LRA), the DISco was found to be a significant explanatory variable and the LRA was an effective model (AUC of 0.7809 and 0.7048, respectively) for predicting the probability of stand damage and High stand damage. Therefore, the DISco was shown to be an effective tool for assessing the damage risk of deer in young Sugi plantations with deer-proof fences.

AB  - The feral cattle of the subantarctic island of Amsterdam provide an outstanding case study of a large mammalian population that was established by a handful of founders and thrived within a few generations in a seemingly inhospitable environment. Here, we investigated the genetic history and composition of this population using genotyping and sequencing data. Our inference showed an intense but brief founding bottleneck around the late 19th century and revealed contributions from European taurine and Indian Ocean Zebu in the founder ancestry. Comparative analysis of whole-genome sequences further revealed a moderate reduction in genetic diversity despite high levels of inbreeding. The brief and intense bottleneck was associated with high levels of drift, a flattening of the site frequency spectrum and a slight relaxation of purifying selection on mildly deleterious variants. Unlike some populations that have experienced prolonged reductions in effective population size, we did not observe any significant purging of highly deleterious variants. Interestingly, the population's success in the harsh environment can be attributed to preadaptation from their European taurine ancestry, suggesting no strong bioclimatic challenge, and also contradicting evidence for insular dwarfism. Genome scan for footprints of selection uncovered a majority of candidate genes related to nervous system function, likely reflecting rapid feralization driven by behavioral changes and complex social restructuring. The Amsterdam Island cattle offers valuable insights into rapid population establishment, feralization, and genetic adaptation in challenging environments. It also sheds light on the unique genetic legacies of feral populations, raising ethical questions according to conservation efforts.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Geranium pratense L. (Meadow Crane's-Bill). The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of Britain and Ireland : distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation.Geranium pratense is a perennial gynodioecious forb of neutral grassland. In Britain and Ireland, it is particularly abundant on roadside verges, railway embankments, the margins of watercourses and woodland rides. It is generally intolerant of grazing and is absent or scarce in livestock-grazed grassland. Geranium pratense is widespread in England, Wales and Scotland but is scarce in Ireland. It has an extensive native range in Europe and Asia, extending eastwards to Russia, north-western China and Mongolia. It has been widely introduced to new sites within its native range and has been introduced to Canada, the USA and New Zealand.Geranium pratense usually occurs on free-draining soils but also infrequently where drainage is impeded. The soils are often nutrient-rich and weakly acidic to weakly alkaline. The underlying geology is usually non-acidic sedimentary rocks or superficial deposits.Geranium pratense is protandrous and is pollinated by various insects of the orders Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera, particularly bumblebees, solitary bees, hoverflies and butterflies. Eleven species of phytophagous insect have been recorded on G. pratense in Britain and Ireland.Geranium pratense has little or no capacity for vegetative spread. Primary seed dispersal is ballistic and seeds may be flung over distances of up to several metres. The species has a transient seed bank, that is germination typically takes place in the winter and spring after seed production, after the physically dormant seeds have become permeable. Seedling establishment is higher in vegetation-free gaps than in undisturbed grassland vegetation.There has been no significant change in its distribution between the late 1950s and 2019, although since 2000, it has expanded its range, mainly via introductions, in northern and western Scotland, west Wales and in Ireland. Alien sites have increased markedly since the 1960s due to introductions from wildflower seed sowing and spread from gardens.

AB  - A central debate in ecology has been the long-running discussion on the role of apex predators in affecting the abundance and dynamics of their prey. In terrestrial systems, research has primarily relied on correlational approaches, due to the challenge of implementing robust experiments with replication and appropriate controls. A consequence of this is that we largely suffer from a lack of mechanistic understanding of the population dynamics of interacting species, which can be surprisingly complex. Mechanistic models offer an opportunity to examine the causes and consequences of some of this complexity. We present a bioenergetic mechanistic model of a tritrophic system where the primary vegetation resource follows a seasonal growth function, and the herbivore and carnivore species are modeled using two integral projection models (IPMs) with body mass as the phenotypic trait. Within each IPM, the demographic functions are structured according to bioenergetic principles, describing how animals acquire and transform resources into body mass, energy reserves, and breeding potential. We parameterize this model to reproduce the population dynamics of grass, elk, and wolves in northern Yellowstone National Park (USA) and investigate the impact of wolf reintroduction on the system. Our model generated predictions that closely matched the observed population sizes of elk and wolf in Yellowstone prior to and following wolf reintroduction. The introduction of wolves into our basal grass-elk bioenergetic model resulted in a population of 99 wolves and a reduction in elk numbers by 61% (from 14,948 to 5823) at equilibrium. In turn, vegetation biomass increased by approximately 25% in the growing season and more than threefold in the nongrowing season. The addition of wolves to the model caused the elk population to switch from being food-limited to being predator-limited and had a stabilizing effect on elk numbers across different years. Wolf predation also led to a shift in the phenotypic composition of the elk population via a small increase in elk average body mass. Our model represents a novel approach to the study of predator-prey interactions, and demonstrates that explicitly considering and linking bioenergetics, population demography and body mass phenotypes can provide novel insights into the mechanisms behind complex ecosystem processes.

AB  - Cervid populations introduced to favorable habitats in confinement often increase excessively without predators and hunting. Overabundant deer populations impact the ecosystems and may cause damages to agriculture and forestry. Long-term count data on the changes in a deer population is essential to understand the relationship between the population dynamics and the natural vegetation. The introduced sika deer (Cervus nippon Temminck, 1836) population without predators on Nakanoshima Island, Hokkaido, Japan, showed repeated irruptions and declines with mass mortality and irregular culling between 1980s and 2000s. The overabundant deer significantly altered the natural vegetation, and density-dependent changes in population parameters such as body size and reproduction were observed. Here, we present the drive count and culling data to examine the population dynamics during 1980-2023. Deer were counted by 20-30 walking drivers and 2-3 observers on boats once per year in February or March. The number of counted deer rapidly increased from the original three introduced around 1960 to >270 deer (the first peak) in two decades and decreased by half due to starvation and the first culling. Thereafter, the number of counted deer continued to increase with a lower growth rate, reached a higher peak (>400, the second peak) than the first irruption in two decades, and decreased again by half due to starvation and the second culling. Although the number of counted deer increased again up to >300 in several years, it decreased and was maintained at around 100 deer with the annual culling program since 2012.

AB  - Wildlife reintroduction projects are an important tool for restoring traditional wildlife heritage, increasing species diversity, providing subsistence and sport hunting and other recreational opportunities, and assisting ecosystem adaption to future climate change. In Minnesota, the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa and some conservationists advocate for the expansion of existing elk range to other parts of the state. For reintroduction projects to be successful, it is helpful if managers understand stakeholders' preferences for management objectives. We used best-worst scaling (BWS) to assess residents' preferences for management objective alternatives. The University of Minnesota, in collaboration with the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa and the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, conducted a mail-back questionnaire of landowners (n = 4500) and the general public (n = 4000) in northeastern Minnesota to determine their attitudes toward elk reintroduction. Results suggest that the most preferred objectives were minimizing negative impacts on existing wildlife populations and reintroducing native species. In contrast, the least important objectives were related to providing elk viewing opportunities or maximizing economic opportunities through elk-related tourism. These findings help inform management objectives related to the reintroduction proposal, provide insight to minimize potential conflict and help develop future communication material related to elk reintroduction.

AB  - The study of home range utilization of rewilded animals is important for informed reintroduction management. Sixteen Milu adult individuals (5 male 11 female) were reintroduced from Jiangsu Dafeng Milu National Nature Reserve to Hunan East Dongting Lake National Nature Reserve on February 28, 2016, out of which 11 Milu individuals (1 male 10 female) were wearing GPS satellite tracking collars. Subsequently, with the aid of GPS collar technology, combined with on-ground tracking observations, we tracked the reintroduced Milu for one year from March 2016 to February 2017. We used the dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Model to estimate the individual home range of the 10 rewilded Milu (1 male 9 female, 1 female individual was eliminated because its collar fell off) and seasonal home range of 5 rewilded female Milu (all tracked for up to one year). 95% level represented the home range, and 50% level represented the core areas. Temporal variation in normalized difference vegetation index were used to quantify changes in food availability. We also quantified resource use of rewilded Milu by calculating the selection ratio for all habitats within their core areas. The results showed that: (1) a total of 52,960 coordinate fixes were collected; (2) during the early stage of rewilding, the average home range size of the rewilded Milu was 17.62 +/- 3.79 km(2) and the average core areas size was 0.77 +/- 0.10 km(2); (3) the annual average home range size of the female deer was 26.08 +/- 5.21 km(2) and the annual average core areas size was 1.01 +/- 0.14 km(2) at the early stage of rewilding; (4) during the early stage of rewilding, the home range and core areas of the rewilded Milu were significantly affected by season, and the difference between summer and winter was significant (home range: p = 0.003; core areas: p = 0.008); (5) home range and core areas of the rewilded female deer in the Dongting Lake area in different seasons showed significant negative correlation with NDVI (home range: p = 0.000; core areas: p = 0.003); (6) Most rewilded female Milu showed a high preference for farmland in all seasons except winter, when they focused on using lake and beach. The home range of the rewilded Milu in the Dongting Lake area at the early stage of rewilding experienced significantly seasonal changes. Our study reveals seasonal differences in the home ranges of rewilded Milu and the resource use strategies of individual Milu in response to seasonal changes. At last, we put forward the following management recommendations: (1) to establish habitat islands; (2) to implement community co-management; (3) to reduce human disturbance; (4) to strengthen population monitoring for formulating species conservation plans.

AB  - In forests affected by heavy fires and continuous grazing of exotic herbivorous mammal species, Nothofagus pumilio (lenga) cannot recover naturally. The main factors that hinder the natural recovery of these forests and the feasibility of native tree plantations are the exotic herbivorous pressure, like that produced by Lepus europaeus (European hare), and the environment degradation degree by anthropic disturbances. The objective of this study was to evaluate different plantation efforts to recover N. pumilio forests degraded by fires in Chilean Patagonia. The plantation actions also included wire fences for sapling protection in 100 ha, where 60 ha were established during autumn (May 2012), and 40 ha were established during spring (October 2012). In March 2013 we recorded the height annual growth (cm year(-1)), the section browsed at each sapling, the modification of plant form (number of new branches), and the vigor expression. We evaluated the data using one- and two-way ANOVAs, Cohen's d effect size, and chi-square analyses. We measured a total of 872 plants, where 42% presented damages caused by European hare browsing. These results indicated that the wire fences were not completely useful to stop the damage on saplings (Cohen's d effect size = < 0.2). We also found that autumn plantations were more susceptible to damage than those established during spring. European hares predominantly browsed on a particular sapling section: the apical buds. As a consequence, the browsed saplings had lower height growth than undamaged ones. These outputs highlight the need to explore and implement alternative actions for the rehabilitation of these degraded deciduous forests, to achieve the objectives of sustainable management or to recover the natural ecosystem functions.

AB  - North Africa's megafauna has developed behavioural adaptations to reduce energetic and fitness costs under harsh arid land conditions. Animal behaviour and activity patterns are difficult to study in the wild, but remote camera traps provide a solution to collecting data without the presence of a researcher influencing outcomes. Here, we report results from a study comprising over 20,382 camera-trap days during a 34-month period in Dghoumes National Park, Tunisia. We aimed to evaluate temporal activity patterns and their overlap and explore opportunities for niche partitioning. Our focal species were the reintroduced scimitar-horned oryx, north-African ostrich, dorcas gazelles and extant regional top-order predators, African wolf and red fox. We found differences in activity patterns between seasons across the focal species, with the most noticeable change being an increase in dawn activity from 1% to 33% between winter and summer for the red fox. Consequently, higher summer temperatures limit opportunities for temporal niche partitioning and push focal species towards dawn-time activity peaks resulting in higher intra-guild overlap values at dawn. Arid antelopes have physiological adaptations that enable them to better exploit ecological resources in hotter time periods than the carnivores, and this reduces inter-guild overlap during summer days.

AB  - Most studies of species interactions in rocky intertidal communities focus on invertebrate predators and herbivores interacting with sessile invertebrates and macrophytes. However, shorebirds are usually a conspicuous presence on rocky shores and eat sessile and mobile invertebrate prey, often including invertebrate predators and herbivores. Inspired by classic studies of strong bird predation effects in rocky intertidal habitats in Washington state (USA) and South Africa, I tested the effects of bird and invertebrate (sea stars, whelks) predation at multiple sites, wave exposures, and zones on the central Oregon coast from spring 1996 to fall 1997. To gain insight into the effects of birds relative to the effects of invertebrate predators, I used a crossed design, with bird exclusions (present and absent) and invertebrate predator removal (present and reduced). Compared to Washington state and South Africa, birds had little effect on the abundance of sessile or mobile prey in wave-exposed mid, wave-exposed low, and wave-protected mid zones at 2-4 sites. I suggest that differences between Oregon results and those in Washington and South Africa were driven by differences in bird abundance associated with whether the study site had resident colonies of shorebirds (primarily gulls, crows, and oystercatchers). That is, offshore islands often have resident breeding colonies such as in the Washington and South African studies, while sites in this study were all on the mainland where gulls were mostly transient visitors, while resident oystercatchers were usually limited to one or two pairs per site. Comparison with other marine and terrestrial experimental tests suggests that top-down effects of birds often vary in strength, and thus, future investigations should seek to understand the factors that underlie this variation.

AB  - The sea urchin Diadema africanum is an herbivore that has a significant influence on subtidal rocky reef communities on the Canary Islands, facilitating transitions between macroalgal beds and barren grounds. Barren grounds in the archipelago are characterized by a dominance of crustose coralline algae and a lack of invertebrates and fishes compared to macroalgal beds, which are mainly dominated by brown algae. To assess the impact of these benthic community states on the early life success of D. africanum, a manipulative study was conducted in September 2021 at four sites on the eastern coast of Tenerife Island, characterized by the availability of historical settlement rates and adult data for this species. For this purpose, experimental larval collectors modified with a hollow algae-container were employed to examine sea urchin settlement rates in response to two dominant algal species, Lobophora schneideri, in macroalgal beds and crustose coralline algae (CCA) in barren grounds. Statistical analysis revealed significant spatial differences in sea urchin settlement and the interaction between site and treatment response. Specifically, the site with higher sea urchin settlement exhibited lower numbers of D. africanum settlers in treatments containing L. schneideri than in the Control and CCA treatments. Three decapod species (the pistol shrimp Alpheus macrocheles, and the crabs Lophozozimus incisus, and Pachygrapsus marmoratus) negatively correlated with D. africanum settlers. These results suggest that larval supply, L. schneideri beds, and micropredator abundance play a role in the early life success of this species. This may imply a community stability mechanism that helps to prevent shifts between alternative stable states.

AB  - The Moose Horn Pass Caribou Fence site (KjRx-1) consists of three wooden fences located in a remote area of the Mackenzie Mountains in Canada's Northwest Territories. Situated in the traditional homeland of the Shuhtagot'ine (Mountain Dene), they were used to assist past hunters to harvest northern mountain caribou by channeling multiple animals toward kill zones. The main fence is nearly 800 m in length and terminates in a corral structure after descending from high ground into a valley. The two smaller fences are located north and south of the main fence, and they do not descend into the valley. Standard dendrochronological methods were employed to determine the ages of wood taken from the fence structures. Seventy-five living white spruce (Picea glauca) trees in the area were cored to determine the overall tree-ring growth patterns in the local environment. The chronology of living trees was supplemented by the inclusion of 29 standing-dead trees to establish a longer chronology of dated ring widths. Sixty-two of 89 cross-sections cut from the fence timbers were crossdated and added to the overall chronology, which created a well-replicated chronology of ring-widths from 972 to 2016 C.E. The terminal dates of material from the three fence systems suggest that the complex was built from trees that died over a wide temporal period, spanning the years 1314 to 1876 C.E, with clusters of dates between ca. 1420-1480 and 1580-1750 C.E. The millennial-long chronology developed in this study can now be used as a base to assist in dendroarchaeological dating of many more artifacts from the region.

AB  - L, The inaugural Pacific Ecological Security Conference (PESC) was held in October 2022, bringing together over 100 island leaders, policy-makers, natural resource managers and global and regional invasive species experts to prioritise the critical issue of invasive species in the Pacific Islands Region. Participants confirmed that invasive species are a major threat to building and maintaining climate resilience and adaptability of Pacific Island ecosystems, as well as food security, biodiversity, sustainable livelihoods and the protection of cultural resources and way of life. Three region-wide strategic action plans were developed to guide interventions focused on the topics of invasive ants, coconut rhinoceros beetle and the use of biological control as a pest and weed management tool. These plans were the major outcome of the PESC and, when implemented, will result in coordinated activities that take a "whole-of-Pacific" approach to invasive species biosecurity and management. Here, we briefly describe the background, planning and engagement process for the three plans, summarise any country- and territory-level data obtained through the process and detail what is planned to occur over the next few years. In addition to the adoption and implementation of the strategies as a result of this inaugural PESC, we anticipate that the PESC will become the premier regional conference aimed at reducing the entry and impacts of invasive species to improve sustainability of environments and peoples of the Pacific.

AB  - The abundance of hard ticks can be determined by abiotic factors and the presence of suitable hosts. Since deer represent important hosts for many tick species, it is imperative to investigate whether deer introduction will increase the number of ticks, which can transmit a wide variety of pathogens. The sika deer (Cervus nippon) was introduced to Green Island, Taiwan, to supply velvet antlers, a traditional Chinese medicine. However, they were later released into the wild after a steep decline in antler prices. We conducted surveys for questing ticks, ticks on rodents and shrews, and the fecal pellet groups of ungulates (deer and goats) in 31 transects within 3 habitat types (forest, grassland, and roadside) on Green Island every 2 months in 2019. A total of 5,321 questing ticks were collected. All collected ticks were Haemaphysalis mageshimaensis Saito and Hoogstraal, a species first identified on an island with an abundance of sika deer. Additionally, 48 ticks collected from 126 trapped rodents and shrews were almost invariably Ixodes granulatus (except for 1 larval Haemaphysalis sp.). We did not find a positive correlation between the number of questing ticks and the number of fecal pellet groups, suggesting that factors other than ungulate abundance affect tick abundance. Nevertheless, large populations of questing ticks along some roadsides suggest a high risk of tick-borne diseases to tourists on this tropical island.

AB  - Little is known of insect biodiversity on Isla Guadalupe, a large (c. 250 km(2)) Pacific island located off the west coast of Baja California, Mexico, which has undergone more than 150 years of extensive habitat degradation owing to grazing by feral goats. Goats were successfully eradicated in 2007, and thus Isla Guadalupe provides a rare opportunity to study changes in biodiversity in the flora and fauna as the habitat in this isolated geographic region begins to recover. We conducted a preliminary survey of Lepidoptera biodiversity by collecting and observing mainly adult individuals during July-August, 2019. We also included previous observations from 2003-2016, and two historical records dating back to 1874 and 1922. Our annotated inventory includes 31 species of Lepidoptera (10 species of butterflies from four families, and 21 species of moths from seven families), and includes one butterfly species recorded 100 years ago that we did not find and which may be extirpated. Although life history stages were not recorded (except for the cosmopolitan Vanessa cardui), we also comment on the availability of potential larval host plants based on literature records from other regions. Most of the Lepidoptera species in our inventory (n = 22) have also been recorded from at least one of the comprehensively studied Channel Islands in southern California, USA, and all 31 species are also present on the California mainland. Thus, the Lepidoptera fauna on Isla Guadalupe recorded here corresponds to that associated with Californian Biogeographic Province.

AB  - Large African mammal populations are traditionally estimated using the systematic reconnaissance flights (SRF) with rear-seat observers (RSOs). The oblique-camera-count (OCC) approach, utilizing digital cameras on aircraft sides, proved to provide more reliable population estimates but incurs high manual processing costs. Addressing the urgent need for efficiency, the research explores whether a semi-automated deep learning (SADL) model coupled with OCC improves wildlife population estimates compared to the SRF-RSO method. The study area was the Comoe<acute accent> National Park, in Ivory Coast, spanning 11,488 km2 of savannas and open forests. It was surveyed following both SRF-RSO standards and OCC method. Key species included the elephant, western hartebeest, roan antelope, buffalo, kob, waterbuck and warthog. The deep learning model HerdNet, priorly pre-trained on images from Uganda, was incorporated in the SADL pipeline to process the 190,686 images. It involved three human verification steps to ensure quality of detections and to avoid overestimating counts. The entire pipeline aims to balance efficiency and human effort in wildlife population estimation. RSO and SADL-OCC approaches were compared using the Jolly II analysis and a verification of 200 random RSO observations. Jolly II analysis revealed SADL-OCC estimates significantly higher for small-sized species (kob, warthog) and comparable for other key species. Counting differences were mainly attributed to vegetation obstruction, RSO observations not found in the images, and suspected RSO counting errors. Human effort in the SADL-OCC approach totaled 111 h, representing a significant time savings compared to a fully manual interpretation. Introducing the SADL approach for aerial surveys in Comoe<acute accent> National Park enabled us to address the OCC's time-intensive image interpretation. Achieving a significant reduction in human workload, our method provided population estimates comparable to or better than SRF-RSO counts. Vegetation obstruction was a key factor explaining differences, highlighting the OCC method's limitation in vegetated areas. Method comparisons emphasized SADL-OCC's advantages in spotting isolated, small and static animals, reducing count variance between sample units. Despite limitations, the SADL-OCC approach offers transformative potential, suggesting a shift towards DL-assisted aerial surveys for increased efficiency and affordability, especially using microlight aircraft and drones in future wildlife monitoring initiatives.

AB  - Climate change may affect the ability of hunters to harvest wildlife and, hence, threaten food security of local people. However, few studies have investigated the relative influence of environmental conditions on wildlife harvest rates. We harnessed a 24-year dataset of harvest dates for a boreal ungulate in a region where climate change is having pronounced impacts on snow depth, precipitation, and temperatures to investigate the effect of weather on harvest rates. We used generalized linear models and a model selection framework to examine the influence of weather covariates (snow depth, mean daily temperature, precipitation) and socio-economic factors (gasoline and red meat prices, employment rates, and moose [Alces americanus] harvest) on harvest rates of bison (Bison bison) in Yukon, Canada, at two temporal scales: annual and daily. At an annual scale, snow depth was the only covariate that was important in explaining bison harvest. No socioeconomic variables improved our model beyond the null. At the daily scale, snow depth and mean daily temperature influenced bison harvest rates, with a 1 SD increase resulting in a 14 % and 9 % increase in daily harvest rates, respectively. Increased snow depth facilitates ease of travel in remote, roadless areas by snowmobile to locate bison and truncates movements of bison, resulting in increased harvest rates. Decreased snow depth due to climate change will impact hunter access to boreal ungulates and food security for northern people. More broadly, our data suggests that in some socioecological systems, environmental covariates have a greater influence on wildlife harvest rates than socioeconomic factors and need to be considered in future studies to better understand and predict harvest rates.

TI  - Genetic divergence and demography of pudu deer (Pudu puda) in five provinces of southern Chile, analyzed through latitudinal and longitudinal ranges
T2  - NEOTROPICAL BIOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
LA  - English
AB  - Pudu deer (Pudu puda) is endemic to the temperate rainforests of Chile. Genetic studies at different geographic scales for this species are required to better determine the genetic divergence within and among populations and their demography across the distribution range. These data can provide unique insights into the species or population status for conservation plans and decision-makers. We analyzed the mtDNA control region (CR) and cytochrome b (Cyt b) sequences of pudu deer in five provinces of southern Chile located at different latitudinal locations (Cautin, Valdivia, Osorno, Llanquihue and Chiloe Island) and three geographic areas within the studied provinces, representative of different longitudinal sites (Andes range, Central Valley and Coastal Range), to understand their genetic divergence and demography. The haplotype (H) and nucleotide (Pi) diversities of CR and Cyt b ranged from 0.64286 to 0.98333 and from 0.00575 to 0.01022, respectively. CR diversity was significantly different among provinces, with Valdivia showing higher values than Llanquihue and Chiloe Island (H = 0.98333 vs. 0.64286-0.92727, P < 0.05). Cyt b variation also showed significant differences among provinces, particularly, among Cautin and Llanquihue (H = 1.000 vs. 0.222, P < 0.05). Genetic structuring among provinces was relatively high, as indicated by the F-ST index (F-ST = 0.41905). Clustering analysis indicated the presence of a distinctive cluster for Chiloe Island individuals. Fu's F-S and Tajima's D based on CR revealed significant, negative deviations from equilibrium for Chiloe Island (D =-1.65898), Valdivia (Fs =-7.75335) and Llanquihue (Fs =-3.93267), suggesting population expansion in these provinces. Analysis at the longitudinal range showed significant differences among areas based on Pi (P < 0.05), with the Andes range and Central Valley showing higher diversity than the Coastal Range. Neither population structuring (F-ST = 0.01360, P > 0.05) nor distinctive clusters in the longitudinal range were observed. Fu's Fs and Tajima's D were negative and significant for the Coastal Range based on CR (Fs =-6.64752, P < 0.001) and Cyt b (D =-1.74110, P < 0.05), suggesting the existence of population expansion. Our results suggest that pudu deer in the analyzed provinces is a genetically structured species, which could be associated with reduced panmixia among populations. The genetic divergence pattern and the population expansion recorded are likely to be associated with past processes of recolonization after Pleistocene glaciation events.

AB  - Bush encroachment is increasingly becoming a problem for biodiversity conservation in African savannas. While this invasion by woody vegetation may hamper avian scavengers such as vultures, which primarily search by sight, it may benefit mammalian scavengers that search by smell. This study aimed to examine the ability of nocturnal mammalian and diurnal avian scavengers to locate carcasses at increasing vegetation densities. We successively placed 27 impala (Aepyceros melampus) carcasses five days apart in a 2000 ha fenced game camp that offered an extensive range of woody plant densities. Scavenger arrivals and first feedings were recorded with camera traps. The avian scavengers, mainly white-backed Vultures (Gyps africanus), fed exclusively on carcasses during the day, and mammalian scavengers, predominantly brown hyenas (Parahyena brunnea), fed solely at night. The two guilds thus competed exploitatively without direct interaction between them. For vultures, the time taken to locate a carcass increased with woody plant density. The mean density of woody plants that avian scavengers located carcasses at was 2188 plants/ha, whereas mammalian scavengers located carcasses at appreciably higher densities of 5156 plants/ha. Resource managers need to understand the synergy between maintaining woody vegetation to benefit nocturnal mammalian scavengers and maintaining open savannas to benefit diurnal avian scavengers.

AB  - Conservation translocations are complex and challenging, but are frequently employed to tackle biodiversity decline. Large predator translocations can be particularly emotive and contentious, in part because they present actual or perceived risks to the safety and livelihoods of people. Understanding the social feasibility of conservation translocations is imperative, and provides opportunities to identify and address these risks. In Britain, the Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx is the most frequently raised prospect for large carnivore reintroduction. We used Q-Methodology to explore stakeholder perspectives on the prospect of lynx reintroduction to Scotland. We identified five perspectives: Lynx for Change was supportive of lynx reintroduction, feeling that lynx could facilitate ecosystem restoration. Lynx for Economy was also supportive, anticipating economic benefits to local communities. No to Lynx was strongly opposed, perceiving that humans were fulfilling the roles of absent large carnivores. Scotland is not Ready supported the conversation but perceived prohibitive socio-ecological barriers. We are not Convinced was not satisfied that an adequate case for biodiversity gain had been made, but was open to further exploration of the potential. There were important areas of divergence among the perspectives over the potential impacts on sheep farming and the degree to which environments should be managed by people or encouraged to self-regulate. There was a consensus on a lack of trust between stakeholder groups, which was primarily rooted in participants' experiences of previous wildlife reintroductions and the contemporary management of recovering predators. However, there was also consensus that, should lynx reintroduction continue to be explored, a participatory, cross-sectoral approach could address these trust issues, help manage existing and emergent conflicts, and build knowledge collaboratively. We provide a foundation for future dialogue between stakeholders over the prospective reintroduction of the lynx to Scotland and recommend a stakeholder-focused participatory process as the next step. Our findings have wider relevance for wildlife reintroductions, species recovery and conservation conflicts elsewhere. Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - The hypothesis that transformation of rangelands by domestic mesoherbivores follows state-andtransition models allows for the prediction that the vegetation could cross an ecological threshold. We examine this hypothesis by attempting to identify structural thresholds in Gamka Thicket, a structurally heterogeneous variation of Albany Thicket in South Africa. We relate the physical structure and density of thicket bush clumps to distance from artificial watering points in four piosphere treatments differing in rangeland management history. Furthermore, we compare the pattern, extent, and variation in transformation at the end regions of our piosphere treatments with each other and with a transformed and untransformed reference site. Changes to the density and leaf mass below 1.5 m of bush clumps indicate that their structure is profoundly altered by mesoherbivores. Nevertheless, the evidence is not sufficient to indicate that irreversible changes in the physical structure of bush clumps have taken place and therefore that structural thresholds have been crossed. A useful addition to our sampling design would be to include exclosure plots along the piosphere gradients. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Insect populations are declining due to a multitude of causes. One major cause is the loss of suitable habitat. Recently, green roofs have been investigated for their potential to mitigate this loss of habitat in urbanized environments. In Belgium, most installed green roofs are characterized by a thin layer of mineral substrate and a vegetational composition that is mainly dominated by species of Sedum, i.e. extensive Sedum-moss roofs or Sedum-moss-herbaceous planting. Lepidoptera, as well as many other insects, exert specific plant-herbivore interactions during at least one phase in their life cycle, but no attention has been paid to investigate the potential of Sedum to serve as host plants. Using a molecular approach, we identified caterpillar communities on both types of extensive green roofs and investigated their gut contents. Ten nocturnal moth species were identified: eight polyphagous macromoths and two monophagous micromoths. All species were found to feed on Sedum, a first record thereof for every species. Based on these findings we conclude that both types of green roofs provide larval habitat for at least some moth species. This can have broad implications considering the fact that moths play a crucial role in multiple trophic interactions. However, when the goal is to increase butterfly diversity in urban environments, other types of green roofs need to be reconsidered. While we did not observe larvae of diurnal butterfly species, there have been reports of imagines on wildflower green roofs or biodiverse (semi-)intensive green roofs.

AB  - Catastrophic wildfires impacted large areas of western Kangaroo Island (KI), South Australia in 2019-2020, burning habitat for many species, including large proportions of the distributional range of the KI micro-trapdoor spider Moggridgea rainbowi, which led to it being listed as Endangered under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC Act). In order to assess population genetic structure in M. rainbowi and detect diagnosable lineages and their distributional patterns across KI, 28 individuals were genotyped for 2495 loci, sampling from all known populations of the species. Population genetic and phylogenetic analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial sequence data provided strong support for three Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) within M. rainbowi; two populations on eastern KI and a heavily fire-impacted western population. High levels of divergence and fixed allelic differences between 5 and 16% indicate a lack of gene flow between ESUs and long periods of isolation. Distributional patterns of these lineages match likely locations of isolation events caused by successive changes to sea level during the Quaternary (2.58 million years ago to present), which led to KI being intermittently connected to the mainland or separated into one or more islands. Our findings have strong conservation implications for M. rainbowi and highlight the importance of inclusion of population genetic structure to inform conservation strategies and to conserve lineage biodiversity at the species level and below.

AB  - Winter annual plants play an important role in arid and semiarid ecosystems because of their rapid response to resource pulses, which drive primary production that provides resources for herbivores and pollinators. Understanding the factors that control annual plant growth is key to predicting how arid and semiarid ecosystems will respond to changes in climate and resource availability from anthropogenic activities. We used a long-term nutrient enrichment experiment that spanned precipitation and urbanization gradients in central Arizona, USA, to examine the effects of climate, surface soil properties, soil nutrient availability and shrub cover on winter annual plant growth. At a landscape scale, aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of winter annual plants had a positive, nonlinear relationship to the amount of precipitation received from October through March of the current growing season. We found evidence for sequential resource limitation of ANPP initially from water then nitrogen and phosphorus. The resource limitation cascade was modified by surface soil properties and location relative to shrubs (under or between shrubs), highlighting the effect of small-scale factors on large-scale processes. Specifically, gravel cover had a negative effect on ANPP, and the effect of shrub cover on ANPP depended on nitrogen and current season rainfall. Our study emphasizes how small-scale factors, such as gravel cover, nutrient availability and presence of shrubs, can interact with large-scale drivers, such as seasonal precipitation, to affect interannual variation in winter annual plant production in the northern Sonoran Desert.

AB  - Translocation is a key conservation strategy, with breeding programs increasingly providing animals for release. Despite its growing use, translocation efforts frequently encounter limited success, particularly when captiveborn animals are involved. Ex-situ environments may lack cues needed to develop survival behaviors, such as predator avoidance, foraging, and social skills. Although practitioners typically address the lack of predator avoidance through training or predator removal, competitor naivety remains largely overlooked, despite its potential to hinder population establishment by compromising access to resources. We examined the impact of pre-release competitor experience on the Pacific pocket mouse (Perognathus longimembris pacificus), one of southern California's most critically endangered mammals. The Pacific pocket mouse is the smallest, and most behaviorally subordinate species in a community of native rodents that compete for resources. We conducted a controlled experiment to test if providing captive-born mice pre-release experience with kangaroo rats (Dipodomys simulans) would improve translocation outcomes. We compared fitness and body condition of pocket mice between the two treatments and examined if behavioral change was exhibited before release. Competitorexperienced females gained more weight and had higher survival and reproductive success than controls, with female survival surpassing that of males in both groups. These findings suggest that incorporating competitor experience into conservation breeding programs could improve translocation success. As competition is a common challenge in natural ecosystems, this behavioral intervention could be applicable for a wide range of species.

AB  - Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is a common disease in Suidae species that causes significant economic losses in the pig industry. This study investigates PRRS in Hungarian wild boar populations and the efforts for eradication of the virus from domestic pig herds. Given the economic significance of PRRS, understanding its prevalence in wild hosts like wild boar is crucial. We examine whether wild boars in Hungary carry the PRRS virus, the seroconversion rate, and the potential relationship between wild boar and domestic pig populations concerning PRRS infection. Our findings indicate a minimal PRRS infection in wild boars, emphasizing the low risk they pose to the PRRS-free status of domestic pig herds. This research contributes to our understanding of PRRS dynamics in wild populations and supports efforts to maintain disease-free domestic pig herds, ensuring the sustainability of pig farming in Hungary. Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) significantly impacts the pig farming industry globally, leading to economic losses due to reduced productivity. This study focuses on assessing the presence and impact of PRRS within Hungarian wild boar populations amidst efforts to eradicate the virus from domestic pig herds. We used a combination of serological and virological tests on samples collected from wild boars across Hungary to evaluate the prevalence of PRRS virus and its potential transmission risks to domestic pigs. Our findings reveal a low seropositivity rate in wild boars, suggesting a minimal role of wild boars in the transmission of PRRS to domestic pig populations. Moreover, no relationship was found between domestic pig and wild boar densities, emphasizing the limited interaction and consequent risk of disease spread between these populations. We confirm the effectiveness of Hungary's PRRS eradication measures among domestic herds and highlight the negligible risk posed by wild boars in re-introducing the PRRS virus.

AB  - Trindade Island has lost much of its original vegetation cover as a result of approximately three centuries of human occupation and intense herbivory caused by invasive mammals. Since the eradication of some of these herbivores, the recovery of some plant species has started. Plantago trinitatis is an endemic herb from Trindade Island, which was considered extinct until 1998, when it was rediscovered in the higher areas of the island. The regeneration of the species was attributed to the soil seed bank. This communication reports new records of P. trinitatis close to sea level on Trindade Island, at lower altitude than previously documented. The new records suggest that P. trinitatis is recolonizing the island, but leaves doubts whether sampling gaps in the past have led to the non-detection of the plant in its vegetative form in these locations, emphasizing that other species considered extinct may share this issue. Regardless of recolonization or sampling gaps, the eradication of invasive herbivores is necessary as a strategy to protect local flora and native vegetation. Understanding the population status can help in making decisions about the need of environmental management and species population recovery.

AB  - Niche variation at population level mediates niche packing (i.e. patterns of species' spread within the niche space) and species coexistence at community level. Competition and ecological opportunity (resource diversity) are two of the main mechanisms underlying niche variation. Dense niche packing could occur through increased niche partitioning or increased niche overlap. In this study, we used stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data of 635 individual rodents from four species across nine sites in the montane region of a subtropical island to test the effects of competition and ecological opportunity on population isotope niche size, inter-individual niche difference within population and interspecific niche overlap within community. We used the Bayesian Standard Ellipse Area (SEAB, the ellipse area enclosed by carbon and nitrogen isotope values of organisms on a bi-plot) to estimate population niche size and interspecific niche overlap. Inter-individual niche difference within population was quantified as isotopic divergence and isotopic uniqueness. We used rodent abundance (the number of unique individuals captured) to measure competition and plant isotope niche size (plant SEAB) to measure ecological opportunity. The rodents experienced competition as evidenced by a negative relationship between population change rate and conspecific abundance. Rodent population niche size increased with ecological opportunity but not competition. The inter-individual niche difference (isotopic uniqueness) increased with competition (interspecific competition only) but not ecological opportunity. At community level, interspecific niche overlap (herbivore-omnivore pair only) increased with competition (the combined abundance of the pair) but not ecological opportunity. This study demonstrated that isotope niche variation of the rodents could be hierarchically influenced by ecological opportunity and competition, with the former setting the limit of population niche size across communities and the latter shaping inter-individual niche difference and interspecific niche overlap within communities. Under strong intraspecific competition and limited ecological opportunity for niche expansion, individuals may choose to increase their isotopic uniqueness from conspecifics at the cost of overlapping with heterospecifics of different trophic roles within the community niche space as overall competition increases. Denser niche packing of these rodent communities might be achieved through increased niche overlap.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of individuality and harem-holding status on the acoustic parameters of rutting calls (bugles) of 14 stags of Siberian wapiti Cervus canadensis sibiricus. The stags competed for mating with hinds in a large herd, free ranging inside a fenced area with complex landscape. We considered as harem-holders the stags, which kept a harem of 5 or more hinds for at least 2 days. Of the 15 days of observations enveloping the most active rutting period, during 3 days there was only one harem in the enclosure, during 9 days two harems, during 2 days three harems and during 1 day four harems. Stag bugles displayed both individual and status-related variation. Harem-holders compared with peripheral stags had shorter bugles with higher minimum fundamental frequency. After winning a harem and changing status from harem-candidate to harem-holder, stags shortened the duration of their bugles, lowered the beginning and maximum fundamental frequency and increased the minimum fundamental frequency. Significantly higher than the levels expected by chance, discriminant analysis classified 78.9% of bugles by the correct stag status and 53.2% of bugles by the correct individual callers. Different acoustic parameters encoded the status and individuality of the bugles. Status was encoded by the duration of the start and end parts and by the beginning and end fundamental frequencies. Individuality was encoded by the maximum fundamental frequency. We discuss that rutting calls of Siberian wapiti, although individualized, do not represent vocal signatures. However, these calls reliably mark stag harem-holding status.

AB  - American plains bison (Bison bison bison, bison hereafter) experienced an extreme demographic bottleneck in the late 1800s. The species has since rebounded but is primarily managed as small and isolated herds due to habitat and sociopolitical limitations. Thus, reintroducing bison and allowing herds to achieve as much of their natural dynamics as possible is a major conservation goal. Concerns about genetic diversity loss in small, isolated herds and the persistence of cattle-origin variants from historical crossbreeding efforts have made genetic analysis an important part of bison conservation. The limitations of the current conservation genetic tools which are based on traditional markers such as microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA sequences, may be overcome with genome-wide genotyping panels commonly developed for agricultural species. Bison reintroduction in the grasslands at American Prairie began in 2005. Genetic analysis on these herds has yet to be conducted. We used the Illumina 777K Bovine genotyping panel to obtain data from 197 bison and 179 domestic cows to understand the current population genetic state of bison at American Prairie and gain insight on cattle (Bos taurus) introgression. Overall, bison at American Prairie currently have relatively high genetic diversity, low inbreeding, and no obvious signs of cattle introgression. A more comprehensive evaluation of introgression, likely including whole-genome sequence data, would clarify this finding. These results can serve as a baseline for future comparison as part of a genetic monitoring framework.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries are immensely important for the livelihoods, nutrition, and cultural identities of millions of people, but their impacts are less understood than those of industrial fisheries. On the island of Teraina in Kiribati's Northern Line Islands, sharks have traditionally been harvested only occasionally for cultural purposes. At the turn of the century, growing access to international markets drove sharp increases in harvests, but the fishery remained small, comprising only 17 fishers in 2013, and a ban on commercial shark fishing and trade was implemented in 2016. To understand the possible impacts of this fishery, we interviewed each fisher, obtaining estimates of catch and effort as early as 1983 and validating these estimates with storehouse inventories. We combined these data with previously published tag-recapture data for grey reef sharks Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos at nearby Palmyra Atoll to inform a Bayesian production model for Teraina's grey reef shark population. Our model suggests that a small number of fishers and motorized boats could plausibly have driven a significant reduction in grey reef shark abundance on surrounding reefs, declining by as much as 75% in as few as 15 yr. Recent ecological and social surveys confirm that shark populations in the Line Islands are likely severely depleted. These results highlight the vulnerability of sharks and other slow-growing marine megafauna to relatively modest small-scale fishing efforts. As few communities, even those that are relatively geographically isolated, remain disconnected from global trade networks, our research suggests a need for management and trade regulations at trans-national scales.

AB  - Plastic pollution is ubiquitous and not even remote protected islands are safe from it. Floating debris can adsorb toxic compounds that concentrate on their surface, being available to the animals that ingest them. For this reason, a baseline study of plastic pollution was conducted in the remote Revillagigedo Archipelago, in the Mexican Pacific Ocean. In 47 manta net samples an average of 4.8 plastics/1000m2 was found, 73% of the pieces being <5 mm. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the most common polymers found. The chemical analysis of organic pollutants revealed that organochlorine pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls are adsorbed on the plastics collected in the area. Filter feeding megafauna such as humpback whales, manta rays and whale sharks could ingest contaminated micro and macroplastics. Plastics were found also on the beach, where they are available to the ingestion by terrestrial animals, including endemic species endangered to extinction.

AB  - The charismatic Syngnathidae occur in coastal and freshwater environments across the globe and play an important role by acting as flagship species for conservation. Despite this status, many syngnathids are threatened by a range of anthropogenic impacts including exploitation and habitat destruction. In addition, the cryptic nature and generally low population densities of syngnathids make research and related conservation action difficult, which can lead to data gaps. The gap in knowledge of the biology and status of syngnathids is especially acute within Africa. This review provides the first synthesis of syngnathid diversity, biogeography, ecology, threats and conservation in sub-Saharan Africa and adjacent islands. Research focus and effort are biased towards the southeast coast of Africa, with limited research specifically on syngnathids. A total of 63 species of syngnathids in 26 genera are recorded in Africa, with higher syngnathid diversity on the east coast of Africa. Ecological research focused on population trends and diversity is identified as priorities, specifically for those species listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List. Other priorities identified include research on the extent and impact of illegal catch and trade and the development of local capacity and expertise. These findings provide an important resource that can be used for the future conservation of this iconic group of fishes.

AB  - Expansion of drainage networks through the headward erosion of tidal creeks is an eco-geomorphologic response of salt marshes to accelerated sea-level rise (SLR). This response can counter the negative impacts of an elevation deficit by increasing drainage and encouraging plant health, thereby reducing potential for submergence and marsh platform loss. In the wetlands of Cape Romain, SC, intense bioturbation near creek heads by the common marsh crab Sesarma reticulatum has been found to facilitate sediment erosion and rapid creek growth. This keystone grazer has been recently observed to have increasing influence on landscape evolution throughout the southeast US coast. Here, we compare measurements taken at Sapelo Island, GA, with those previously collected at Cape Romain, to confirm that eco-geomorphic feedbacks facilitating creek growth at each location are similar, and to compare these processes under differing background conditions. We use sediment cores, precise elevation measurements and historical imagery to compare substrate properties, elevation within the tidal frame, creek growth rates and drainage morphology at both sites. Our results show identical processes; however, the higher elevation of the marsh at Sapelo Island leads to shallower and shorter periods of tidal inundation, explaining the greater soil strength and lower belowground biomass compared with the marsh at Cape Romain. The smaller tidal range at the site in Cape Romain compared with Sapelo Island translates to a proportionally shallower depth of tidal creeks, which therefore requires less erosion to produce headward creek extension. These effects are likely to have contributed to slower growth rates of tidal creeks at Sapelo Island during the past several decades of SLR. Our findings highlight the similarities in process but differences in rates in how marshes are responding to climate-related stress.

AB  - Understanding where consumers control plant reproduction in a time of changing plant-consumer interactions with environmental change can inform conservation. A seminal hypothesis-the environmental stress model (the ESM)-posits that consumer control of plants varies predictably with environmental stress. The ESM has been tested often along gradients of an abiotic stressor, yielding highly mixed support, although plants and consumers are often differently affected by a stressor.Here, to provide a conciliation, we introduced and tested a new ESM-the ESM in plants' versus consumers' perspectives. In field exclusion experiments conducted at three marsh sites that varied broadly in plant productivity, crab abundance and salinity within a coastal landscape, we tested the new ESM in predicting the impact of crab herbivores on the sexual reproduction of Phragmites australis. We analysed how their impact varied with plant productivity and crab abundance-proxies for environmental stresses in plants' and consumers' perspectives, respectively.We found that environmental stresses in plants' and consumers' perspectives were uncoupled across this coastal landscape. Neither crab abundance nor crab grazing intensity was correlated with plant productivity. Plant productivity and crab abundance were inconsistently related to key abiotic stressors including soil salinity.Depending on site, crab herbivores substantially suppressed Phragmites sexual reproductive effort (by >90%, by regulating a series of population- and individual-level reproductive processes) or had little effect. Where crab herbivores had stronger impacts was not predicted by plant productivity, but largely by crab abundance via a threshold model. Above an abundance threshold, crabs increasingly suppressed Phragmites sexual reproductive effort.Synthesis. Our study revealed that consumer control of plant reproduction may be highly variable, even within a coastal landscape and for the same species, and that consumer abundance, rather than plant productivity, was a key predictor of this variation. As plants and consumers become increasingly uncoupled in many ecosystems under environmental change, the newly introduced ESM in plants' versus consumers' perspectives may be more versatile than previously recognized to inform conservation actions.

AB  - Understanding the behavior and ecology of non-native species is important to assess their impact on food webs and ecosystem functions and to facilitate the management of non-native species. The present study reports a case of scavenging on a deer carcass by mammals, especially introduced raccoon dogs and native Japanese weasels, in the World Heritage Site of Yakushima, Japan. A sensor camera was placed near the carcass from March to May 2022 to record scavenging behavior of mammals. Out of at least six species of mammals filmed, raccoon dogs and weasels fed on the carcass. Raccoon dogs almost monopolized the carcass, i.e., raccoon dogs were filmed around carrion more frequently and spent more time scavenging than weasels. Raccoon dogs and weasels were filmed around the carcass at similar times in a day, and no overt aggression was observed between the two species, but weasels were displaced by raccoon dogs. Japanese macaques and sika deer avoided and never fed on carrion. The present study suggests that raccoon dogs contribute to carrion decomposition in the World Heritage Site of Yakushima and that comprehensive studies of carrion availability and the scavenger community could help promote the management of introduced raccoon dogs in Yakushima.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts are an important factor for consideration in wildlife management at urban-wildland interfaces. Effective and adaptive management of human-wildlife conflicts is needed to promote tolerance and coexistence of humans and wildlife. Anecdotal reports suggest a recent spike in human-elk conflicts in California, yet there has not been a systematic analysis of human-elk conflicts in the state. To better understand human-elk conflicts in California, we conducted thematic analysis of human-elk conflicts reported in the California Department of Fish and Wildlife's Wildlife Incident Reporting (WIR) system. We also conducted a hotspot analysis using locations of human-elk conflicts reported in the WIR system and evaluated reports for principles of adaptive management. The WIR system contained n = 89 reports for elk and n = 78 of these described conflicts with elk. Overall, property damage (including crop damage) was the most common type of human-elk conflict reported, occurring in 69% of reports (n = 54/78), followed by non-competitive conflict with domestic animals (13%), competition with domestic livestock (12%), and habituation to humans (24%). We identified three hotspots of human-elk conflict in California in Del Norte, Kern, and San Luis Obispo counties. All incidents of human-elk conflict reported in the WIR system included at least one principle of adaptive management. We recommend modifications to the WIR system and interactions with property owners and stakeholders to enhance and facilitate adaptive management of human-elk conflicts in California.

AB  - Despite enormous efforts, complete animal tuberculosis (TB) eradication has only been achieved in few regions. Epidemiological analyses are key to identify TB risk factors and set up targeted biosecurity measures. Here, we conducted an in-depth characterization of 84 extensive beef cattle farms from a high TB prevalence region in Western Spain, and assessed how farm management and wildlife presence on farms contribute to cattle TB risk. Twenty-six out of 84 variables were associated with cattle farm TB positivity. Farm management variables associated with TB positivity included older cattle, larger herd size, highly fragmented farm structure and greater connectivity between farms. TB-positive farms provided supplemental feed over a higher number of months, used calf feeders, and had higher number of waterholes. Detecting Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European badger (Meles meles), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), or Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon) on cattle farms was also associated with farm TB positivity. The best ordinal regression model indicated that in farms with a large herd size (> 167 animals) the odds of being positive or recurrently positive (versus negative) was 7.34 (95% CI = 2.43-23.51) times higher that of farms with small herd size. Further, for every additional host species detected in the farm premises, the odds of being TB-positive increased 56%. We conclude that both cattle management and wildlife need to be targeted for successful TB control in grazing-based farming systems.

AB  - Globally, high-density populations of feral deer have been associated with a range of negative ecological consequences. Within Australia, limited quantitative research has assessed the impacts of deer, particularly in threatened ecological communities (TECs). Our study aimed to quantify the impact of feral deer on the herbivory of a range of woody plant species, non-woody growth forms and TECs; and assess whether feral deer increase herbivory in TECs above background rates caused by native herbivores. We surveyed 356 transects across 89 sites representing eight TECs and collected herbivory data for woody and non-woody plants. At each site, we recorded the presence or absence of deer sign and abundance of macropod pellets to account for variations in herbivory between groups of sympatric species. Generalised linear mixed models were developed to predict: (i) proportion of individual plants browsed (or grazed); and (ii) average browsing (or grazing) intensity for woody plant species and non-woody plants. Controlling for macropod abundance, we found the average grazing intensity and proportion of non-woody plants grazed was higher when deer were present compared to absent. Specifically, grazing pressure on rushes, cycads, sedges and grasses was significantly higher where deer were present. In contrast, we did not observe a significant impact of deer on woody plant species. The presence of deer resulted in higher grazing intensity in coastal saltmarsh, freshwater wetland, littoral rainforest and bangalay sand forest TECs. Although the deer population across our study region generally appears to be at low density compared to neighbouring regions, their presence is resulting in grazing pressure above that caused by native herbivores for a range of non-woody plants. Our results contribute to a growing body of research about the ecological impacts of feral deer in Australia and can be used as a baseline for ongoing regional monitoring of deer impacts in TECs.

AB  - The results of a two-year study conducted to assess the outcomes of a long-term forest isolation experiment are presented. A section of a spruce-birch forest in Yaroslavl oblast (6S4B, 100 years old, quality class I) was isolated from the presence of moose for 25 years. It is established that net mineralization of nitrogen compounds in the 0- to 12-cm soil horizon measured from May to October under field conditions was more intense in the unfenced area in comparison with the isolated area (15 +/- 0.4 and 10.4 +/- 0.5 g N/m(2), respectively). Carbon dioxide emissions from the soil in that same time period were lower in the unfenced area (319 +/- 47 g C/m(2)) than in the isolated area (552 +/- 82 g C/m(2)). On the isolated site, 19 mg of nitrogen is mineralized in the soil per gram of C-CO2; while on the control site, it is 47 mg of nitrogen per gram of C-CO2. In the isolated variant, the distribution of ammonium concentrations in the upper (0-4 cm) soil horizon is normal, while in the control variant, it is lognormal due to the presence of elk.

AB  - Birds increase crop yields via consumption of pests in some contexts but disrupt pest control via intraguild predation in others. Landscape complexity acts as an inconsistent mediator, sometimes increasing, decreasing, or not impacting pest control. Here, we examined how landscape context and seasonal variation mediate the impact of birds on arthropod pests and natural enemies, leaf damage, and yields of broccoli (Brassica oleracea) on highly diversified farms that spanned the USA west coast. Our study had two complementary components: a bird exclusion experiment and molecular diet analysis of 357 fecal samples collected from the most commonly captured bird species that also foraged in Brassica fields-American Goldfinch (Spinus tristis), American Robin (Turdus migratorius), Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), Song Sparrow (Melospiza melodia), and White-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys). Bird access yielded higher, rather than lower, numbers of pest aphids and increased their parasitism, while no other arthropods examined were consistently impacted. Independent of bird presence, percent natural cover in the landscape sometimes increased and sometimes decreased densities of arthropods in the mid-growth period, with diminishing impacts in the late-growth period. Herbivore feeding damage to broccoli leaves decreased with increasing amounts of natural land cover and in the late-growth period. Molecular diet analysis revealed that Brassica pests and predatory arthropods were relatively uncommon prey for birds. Landscape context did not alter the prey items found in bird diets. Altogether, our bird-exclusion experiment and molecular diet analysis suggested that birds have relatively modest impacts on the arthropods associated with broccoli plantings. More broadly, the limited support in our study for net natural pest control services suggests that financial incentives may be required to encourage the adoption of bird-friendly farming practices in certain cropping systems.

AB  - The decline of semi-natural open ecosystems after land abandonment is a conservation issue in many industrialized countries. Large herbivores, such as horses (Equus ferus), are excellent candidates for rewilding activities, as they can contribute to reducing loss of open landscapes. However, their presence could affect the spatio-temporal distribution of sympatric species, especially if the reintroduction is unplanned and uncontrolled. La Calvana, central Italy, is a protected area with a mammalian community that has never been systematically monitored, and its grasslands, which are a high conservation priority, are disappearing. The area hosts a population of feral horses that originated about 40 years ago from a few released domestic individuals, and their unplanned presence could represent a unique rewilding opportunity for the restoration of the abandoned landscape. Yet nothing is known about their distribution or relationships with sympatric mammals. By deploying 40 camera traps in May-July 2022, we systematically monitored the area to investigate spatio-temporal patterns of feral horses and their relationships with environmental, biotic, and anthropogenic factors. We detected 12 wild mammal species and estimated that horses were present in 40% of the study area. None of the environmental variables tested affected the occupancy of horses, although modeling of site-use intensity revealed that this species used upper-ridge grasslands more frequently. This suggests the area is suitable to support the population and that their presence at higher elevations can be an asset to preserving grasslands by limiting forest and shrub encroachment. Horses occupancy was not related to the relative abundance of wild ungulates, suggesting minimal competition for resources at present. However, the lower temporal overlap at sites with greater vegetation cover during the hottest hours indicated dominance of horses. Feral horses seem unaffected by human proximity, although they are occasionally subject to poaching. Lastly, the 7-year-long population census revealed a 12% annual growth rate that may lead to exceeding the carrying capacity of the ecosystem in the future. We recommend continued monitoring of this population and implementation of conservation and management programs.

AB  - Root-colonizing fungi, such as mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophyte fungi, are often found on pioneer plant species during early primary succession. However, little is known about which fungal species are responsible for the establishment of pioneer plants when these symbionts colonize simultaneously. We investigated the root-colonizing fungal communities of Pinus thunbergii that established prior to lichens, bryophytes, and short-lived herbaceous plants in a primary successional volcanic mudflow site on Kuchinoerabu Island, Japan. We collected a total of 54 current-year and 1- to 2-year-old seedlings. The colonization of root fungi was evaluated by direct observation of key structures (e.g., mantle, arbuscule, microsclerotia, and hyphae) and molecular analysis. Of the 34 current-year seedlings collected, only 12 individuals were colonized by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. By contrast, all 1- to 2-year-old seedlings were colonized by ECM fungi. Seedlings colonized by pine-specific ECM fungi, specifically Rhizopogon roseolus and Suillus granulatus, showed higher nitrogen and phosphorus contents in their needles compared to non-ECM seedlings. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophyte fungi were found in only two and three individuals, respectively. The high density of mycophagous deer on Kuchinoerabu-jima may contribute to the favored dispersal of ECM fungi over other root-colonizing fungi. In conclusion, the seedling establishment of P. thunbergii at the volcanic mudflow may be largely supported by ECM fungi, with negligible effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophytes.

AB  - Human wild-boar conflict is one of the prominent issues in Nepal, especially in areas adjacent to protected areas. Wild boars cause substantial damage to the agricultural crops and affect the lives of rural farmers through economic loss. However, the extent of this loss varies across protected areas. Thus, this study aims to compare the economic loss due to crop damage by wild boar between two protected areas with different management regimes; Shuklaphanta National Park (ShNP) and Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve (DHR). We used a questionnaire survey and descriptive statistics to characterize and compare the pattern of human wild boar conflicts between ShNP and DHR. Altogether, the two protected areas experienced a crop damage of 87,035.78 kg with an estimated economic loss of 26,389 USD within a year in our study. The most damaged crop in the ShNP was paddy whereas that in DHR was potato. We recorded a higher crop damage and economic loss in ShNP than in DHR. However, the severity of conflict is higher in DHR with around 8 % of the total production damaged by wild boar. Although the government declared wild boar an agricultural menace in 2023 and permitted killing on private lands, local communities should also apply other mitigation measures to prevent wild boars from entering crop fields. Additionally, the potential introduction of trophy hunting in ShNP (already permitted in DHR), following comprehensive studies, could help reduce economic losses associated with human-wild boar conflicts. Such combined efforts could create a more sustainable approach to managing wild boar populations while safeguarding local agriculture and livelihoods.

AB  - Camera traps and acoustic recording devices are essential tools to quantify the distribution, abundance and behavior of mobile species. Varying detection probabilities among device locations must be accounted for when analyzing such data, which is generally done using occupancy models. We introduce a Bayesian time-dependent observation model for camera trap data (Tomcat), suited to estimate relative event densities in space and time. Tomcat allows to learn about the environmental requirements and daily activity patterns of species while accounting for imperfect detection. It further implements a sparse model that deals well will a large number of potentially highly correlated environmental variables. By integrating both spatial and temporal information, we extend the notation of overlap coefficient between species to time and space to study niche partitioning. We illustrate the power of Tomcat through an application to camera trap data of eight sympatrically occurring duiker Cephalophinae species in the savanna - rainforest ecotone in the Central African Republic and show that most species pairs show little overlap. Exceptions are those for which one species is very rare, likely as a result of direct competition.

AB  - In an era marked by accelerating climate change, habitat loss, and shifting land use patterns, it is crucial to understand the intricate effects of multiple stressors on ecosystems. This long-term study sheds light on the complex interplay between grazing and habitat characteristics on pasture dynamics and offers insights into how various stressors affect ecosystems facing environmental challenges. Our experimental study documents that manipulation in restricting reindeer grazing and trampling through fencing led to higher ground-lichen biomass, volume, height (particularly in one habitat), and cover compared with open-control plots. The effect of fencing varied depending on habitat, and for lichen biomass, volume, and height, the lowest values were observed in windswept exposed ridges and mountain heaths (exposed/mountain), and the highest values were observed in forested and leeward-heath (forest/leeward) habitat. The average (past five years) number of reindeer per square kilometer had indirect effects that varied across habitats. We observed negative density dependence in the open plots for height in the exposed/mountain habitats. Fencing reduced this effect, which was also valid for biomass except that habitat did not affect the effect of density. Surprisingly, in the forest/leeward areas, the estimated effects of reindeer density on biomass, volume, and height were positive for the fenced plots. Negative density dependence was evident for lichen cover irrespective of habitats and manipulation, even though this effect had little biological significance, whereas cover at the initiation of the experiment positively affected later recordings (particularly for the controls). Our models showed high explanatory power, highlighting the significance of reindeer density and habitat as predictors of ground-lichen dynamics. Overall, negative density-dependent effects were observed in the open plots in the most exposed areas, and fencing mitigated the negative impact of reindeer on lichens, particularly in less exposed areas. We challenge the "equilibrium" and "nonequilibrium" frameworks for explaining livestock-pasture dynamics. We propose future studies to estimate the relative importance of density-dependent and density-independent factors, such as climate, using models considering both mechanisms simultaneously.

AB  - Biodiversity provides essential ecosystem services to agriculture, including pest control and pollination, yet it is declining at an alarming rate, largely due to the agricultural sector. The introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops in the United States marked a major transformation of agricultural production, as over 90% of US corn, soybean and cotton areas are now planted with GM varieties. This shift in crop cultivation has substantially altered crop management practices, most notably the types and quantities of pesticides used. Despite the magnitude of these changes, the impact on biodiversity is still poorly understood. Here we estimate the causal impact of GM crops on bird diversity in the United States and compare bird communities through time in areas with different levels of exposure to GM crops. We find that insectivorous birds benefit from GM crop adoption and that this benefit is largest in cotton. In contrast, herbivorous birds weakly decrease with GM crop adoption. Thus, while GM crop adoption has a small positive effect on overall abundance of birds, the effect is heterogeneous across species groups, with potentially important consequences for bird community composition and associated ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes.
   The effects of genetically modified (GM) crops on biodiversity is not well understood, yet could have important implications due to the many ecosystem services provided by biodiversity to agricultural landscapes. This study evaluates the impact of GM crops on bird diversity in the United States.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict poses significant ecological and socio-economic challenges, particularly in rural communities where agriculture and livestock rearing form the backbone of livelihoods. Despite the growing importance of this issue, District Lakki Marwat remains an unexplored area of northwest Pakistan. This study aims to fill this gap by systematically assessing the status, economic impacts, and community perceptions of five wildlife species: wild boar (Sus scrofa), grey wolf (Canis lupus), golden jackal (Canis aureus), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Using semi-structured surveys with 117 respondents, we analyzed species prevalence, perceived danger levels, crop damage patterns, and predation impacts on livestock and poultry. The findings revealed that wild boars were identified as the primary contributors to agricultural damage, with total annual crop losses surpassing the economic impacts attributed to the studied carnivores. On average, each surveyed household experienced an annual loss of PKR 4510.38. For the 39% of households reporting crop damage, the annual loss per reported household was PKR 11,727, which was higher than the average annual loss across all households, underscoring the severity of the impact on those specifically affected by the wild boar-related crop damage. Notably, community attitudes were most negative toward wild boars, a pattern driven by the economic burden of crop losses, challenging the conventional focus on carnivores as the primary conflict species. A Pearson's X2 test confirmed strong associations between species and perceived danger levels, while regression analysis demonstrated an association between crop damage and negative attitudes. Traditional deterrents like thorn fences were found ineffective against wild boars. More advanced methods, including game-proof fencing, trenches, bio-fencing, crop rotation, audio and visual deterrents, taste and order repellents, and watchtowers combined with group vigilance, are recommended to reduce crop damage. Integrating these approaches with community-based education, habitat management, and government-supported compensation schemes can mitigate wild boar impacts. This study contributes new insights into multi-species HWC dynamics, demonstrating that community perceptions are primarily shaped by the economic impact of a species, regardless of whether it is a carnivore or an omnivore. The attitudes of local communities are driven by the financial losses incurred, rather than the species' behavior or ecological role. This study underscores the need for collaborative efforts to reduce human-wildlife conflict, foster coexistence, and ensure ecological balance in vulnerable rural areas.

AB  - Nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) on prey animals by predators have received considerable interest in wildlife ecology and conservation. However, NCEs by large carnivore species with omnivorous diet still remain unclear. The Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) is widely found in eastern parts of the Eurasian Continent, including Honshu and Shikoku Islands of Japan. At present, this bear species is the only large carnivore in the region as a typical omnivore that occasionally predates sika deer (Cervus nippon). If sika deer recognize predation threats from black bears, then the NCEs by bears will provoke antipredator behavioral responses by the deer. In testing this hypothesis, we evaluated the spatial and temporal overlaps between bears and deer as well as compared the vigilance level and spatiotemporal avoidance observed in sika deer between bear-active and -inactive years, using camera trapping in an agroforest landscape in Fukushima, eastern Japan. Consequently, we found little changes in deer behaviors between bear-active and -inactive years, indicating that sika deer neither exhibited spatial partitioning and spatiotemporal avoidances from black bears nor increased their vigilance even in bear-active year. We concluded that our study showed no significant NCE of omnivorous Asiatic black bears on sika deer.

AB  - Islands are renowned for their remarkable biotas and have been widely recognised as natural laboratories for the study of evolution, speciation, and extinction. Large mammals in insular environments typically evolve to dwarfs and small ones to giants, a trend known as the island rule. Despite their dominance in the continental European mammal faunas of Middle-Late Pleistocene, Bison and Bos are usually lacking from the neighbouring endemic insular assemblages. Here, we report the first insular bovin from the Late Pleistocene of Kythera Island, Greece and we carry out a detailed morphometrical analysis with emphasis on its adaptations and palaeogeographic implications. Based on both dental and postcranial qualitative and quantitative comparisons, we attribute the studied material from Kythera to Bos primigenius. Significant differences from both its continental Pleistocene relative and the endemic bovins from Mediterranean islands, allow us to recognize it as a new subspecies, Bos primigenius thrinacius n. ssp., the third known insular dwarf of this taxon in Europe. Our main hypothesis is that the gradual disconnection of Kythera Island from the neighbouring Peloponnese peninsula just after MIS 6 (late Middle Pleistocene, similar to 180 ka) resulted in the isolation of a mainland Bos primigenius population in the rocky and predator free environment of palaeo-Kythera Island. Under these particular conditions the population underwent some remarkable changes and gained some peculiar features, especially on metapodials. The timing and reasons of Bos primigenius thrinacius extinction remain unknown.

AB  - Introduction: Freshwater ecosystems are susceptible to invasion by alien macrophytes due to their connectivity and various plant dispersal vectors. These ecosystems often experience anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, favouring invasive species that efficiently exploit these resources. Propagule pressure (reflecting the quantity of introduced individuals) and habitat invasibility are key determinants of invasion success. Moreover, the enemy release hypothesis predicts that escape from natural enemies, such as herbivores, allows alien species to invest more resources to growth and reproduction rather than defense, enhancing their invasive potential. Yet, the combined impact of propagule pressure, herbivory, and nutrient enrichment on the competitive dynamics between invasive alien macrophytes and native macrophyte communities is not well understood due to a paucity of studies. Methods: We conducted a full factorial mesocosm experiment to explore the individual and combined effects of herbivory, nutrient levels, propagule pressure, and competition on the invasion success of the alien macrophyte Myriophyllum aquaticum into a native macrophyte community comprising Vallisneria natans, Hydrilla verticillata, and Myriophyllum spicatum. This setup included varying M. aquaticum densities (low vs. high, simulating low and high propagule pressures), two levels of herbivory by the native snail Lymnaea stagnalis (herbivory vs no-herbivory), and two nutrient conditions (low vs. high). Myriophyllum aquaticum was also grown separately at both densities without competition from native macrophytes. Results: The invasive alien macrophyte M. aquaticum produced the highest shoot and total biomass when simultaneously subjected to conditions of high-density intraspecific competition, no herbivory, and low-nutrient availability treatments. Moreover, a high propagule pressure of M. aquaticum significantly reduced the growth of the native macrophyte community in nutrient-rich conditions, but this effect was not observed in nutrient-poor conditions. Discussion: These findings indicate that M. aquaticum has adaptive traits enabling it to flourish in the absence of herbivory (supporting the enemy release hypothesis) and in challenging environments such as intense intraspecific competition and low nutrient availability. Additionally, the findings demonstrate that when present in large numbers, M. aquaticum can significantly inhibit the growth of native macrophyte communities, particularly in nutrient-rich environments. Consequently, reducing the propagule pressure of M. aquaticum could help control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact. Overall, these findings emphasize that the growth and impacts of invasive alien plants can vary across different habitat conditions and is shaped by the interplay of biotic and abiotic factors.

AB  - Kelp forests have declined gradually all over the world. Understanding the trophic structure of such a productive and diverse ecosystem is crucial for its restoration and effective management. Few studies, however, have focused on the trophic structure and functional recovery of kelp forests in the process of restoration. This study was conducted in the eastern coast of Korea where kelp bed restoration was in process with the removal of sea urchins. In addition to quantitative measurement for recovery using common community parameters, we investigated how fast the stability of a food web structure could be established in the newly restored kelp beds with an initially barren condition, using stable isotope analysis, in comparison with a nearby natural bed and barren site. At the restored bed, total algal biomass and diversity reached the levels of the natural bed within 1 year. While the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of macroalgae and organic matter were separated isotopically, they were similar among sites, excluding organic matter at the natural bed in 2019. Most consumers showed similar isotopic values among sites, with overlapping range for delta C-13 of producers. However, some herbivores showed higher delta N-15 values as predators/omnivores, particularly at barrens, which could be explained by trophic plasticity depending on the macroalgal structure. In the restored bed, for the first year, higher trophic diversity (CR, CD) and lower trophic redundancy (MNND, SDNND) showed non-overlapping >50% CIs among sites. However, this distinctive stage moved toward the natural bed upon entering the second year as trophic diversity decreased and trophic redundancy increased while natural bed overlapped at<50% CIs. The recovery speed in this system was fast (1 year for quantitative perspectives and 2 years for functional completion). After removing the sea urchins, recruitment of macroalgae quickly increased concomitantly with consumer groups, boosting the diversity and trophic structure of the restored bed. The trophic structure of the first year of restoration was not an intermediate stage toward the completion, but a transient over-shooting state. This might have been triggered by the fast introduction of diverse macroalgae to the urchin-free bare rock space, providing an interesting finding needed to be tested in other temperate marine systems.

AB  - What would successful deer management look like in Scotland? To some, flourishing populations of native wild deer represent success. But to others, negative impacts such as damage to woodlands and peatlands, agricultural and forestry losses, deer-vehicle collisions, and facilitating Lyme disease spread represent failure. Conflicting interests and incentives among people involved in deer management mean a common definition of success, and therefore clear management targets, remain elusive. While some environmental groups urgently call for an increase in the number of deer culled (shot) each year, other stakeholders aim to maximize deer numbers. Overcoming this governance failure will require clearly articulated, scientifically valid, and socially acceptable socio-ecological objectives to be co-produced by a broad range of stakeholders. Systematic monitoring of deer impacts will also be needed to evaluate the ability of specific management interventions to achieve defined objectives. Reintroducing Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) has been suggested as a means to reduce deer numbers and their negative ecological and socioeconomic impacts. However, evidence of lynx impacts on deer numbers, deer impacts, and social conflicts over deer suggest lynx reintroduction alone would not effectively reduce negative impacts of deer in Scotland, though it could be part of a broader solution. In the short-term, achieving sustainable numbers of deer in Scotland will require a substantial increase in the number of deer culled and effective changes to the way deer management is incentivized, regulated, implemented, and monitored.

AB  - Climate-driven species redistributions are reshuffling the composition of marine ecosystems. How these changes alter ecosystem functions, however, remains poorly understood. Here we examine how impacts of herbivory change across a gradient of tropicalization in the Mediterranean Sea, which includes a steep climatic gradient and marked changes in plant nutritional quality and fish herbivore composition. We quantified individual feeding rates and behaviour of 755 fishes of the native Sarpa salpa, and non-native Siganus rivulatus and Siganus luridus. We measured herbivore and benthic assemblage composition across 20 sites along the gradient, spanning 30 degrees of longitude and 8 degrees of latitude. We coupled patterns in behaviour and composition with temperature measurements and nutrient concentrations to assess changes in herbivory under tropicalization. We found a transition in ecological impacts by fish herbivory across the Mediterranean from a predominance of seagrass herbivory in the west to a dominance of macroalgal herbivory in the east. Underlying this shift were changes in both individual feeding behaviour (i.e. food choice) and fish assemblage composition. The shift in feeding selectivity was consistent among temperate and warm-affiliated herbivores. Our findings suggest herbivory can contribute to the increased vulnerability of seaweed communities and reduced vulnerability of seagrass meadows in tropicalized ecosystems.

AB  - The invasion of the land was a complex, protracted process, punctuated by mass extinctions, that involved multiple routes from marine environments. We integrate paleobiology, ichnology, sedimentology, and geomorphology to reconstruct Paleozoic terrestrialization. Cambrian landscapes were dominated by laterally mobile rivers with unstable banks in the absence of significant vegetation. Temporary incursions by arthropods and worm-like organisms into coastal environments apparently did not result in establishment of continental communities. Contemporaneous lacustrine faunas may have been inhibited by limited nutrient delivery and high sediment loads. The Ordovician appearance of early land plants triggered a shift in the primary locus of the global clay mineral factory, increasing the amount of mudrock on the continents. The Silurian-Devonian rise of vascular land plants, including the first forests and extensive root systems, was instrumental in further retaining fine sediment on alluvial plains. These innovations led to increased architectural complexity of braided and meandering rivers. Landscape changes were synchronous with establishment of freshwater and terrestrial arthropod faunas in overbank areas, abandoned fluvial channels, lake margins, ephemeral lakes, and inland deserts. Silurian-Devonian lakes experienced improved nutrient availability, due to increased phosphate weathering and terrestrial humic matter. All these changes favoured frequent invasions to permament establishment of jawless and jawed fishes in freshwater habitats and the subsequent tetrapod colonization of the land. The Carboniferous saw rapid diversification of tetrapods, mostly linked to aquatic reproduction, and land plants, including gymnosperms. Deeper root systems promoted further riverbank stabilization, contributing to the rise of anabranching rivers and braided systems with vegetated islands. New lineages of aquatic insects developed and expanded novel feeding modes, including herbivory. Late Paleozoic soils commonly contain pervasive root and millipede traces. Lacustrine animal communities diversified, accompanied by increased food-web complexity and improved food delivery which may have favored permanent colonization of offshore and deep-water lake environments. These trends continued in the Permian, but progressive aridification favored formation of hypersaline lakes, which were stressful for colonization. The Capitanian and end-Permian extinctions affected lacustrine and fluvial biotas, particularly the invertebrate infauna, although burrowing may have allowed some tetrapods to survive associated global warming and increased aridification.

AB  - Simple Summary The sika deer (Cervus nippon) was introduced in South Korea from Japan and Taiwan for commercial farming. They have become invasive to mainland South Korea and Jeju Island due to escape from confinement and illegal release. Native species and ecosystems may be threatened by the presence of non-native species. To deal with ecological risk and evolutionary processes, information on the phylogeny of these non-native sika deer is necessary. Genetic studies using mitochondrial DNA cytochrome B (CytB) gene sequences were conducted to determine the subspecies of Jeju sika deer and their phylogenetic relationship. On Jeju Island, we confirmed the presence of two distinct groups of CytB haplotypes: Cervus nippon yakushimae, native sika to Japan, and Cervus nippon taiouanus, native to Taiwan. Non-native species threaten native ecosystems and species, particularly on islands where rates of endemism and vulnerability to threats are high. Understanding species invasion will aid in providing insights into ecological and evolutionary processes. To identify the non-native sika deer (Cervus nippon) population in Jeju, South Korea, and their phylogenetic affinities, we collected tissue samples from roadkill and the World Natural Heritage Headquarters in Jeju. Mitochondrial DNA cytochrome B (CytB) gene sequences were analyzed to determine two distinct CytB haplotypes. Phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood tree revealed two haplotypes of CytB clustered into two different groups representing two subspecies: C. n. yakushimae, native to Japan, and C. n. taiouanus, native to Taiwan. The tentative divergence time between the two subspecies was estimated at 1.81 million years. Our study confirmed that the two subspecies of sika deer are sympatric in the natural ecosystem of Jeju Island. This study provides valuable information to help government and conservation agencies understand alien species and determine control policies for conserving native biodiversity in South Korea.

AB  - Highly abundant ungulate populations are widely observed in heavily browsed habitats; however, few studies have investigated the effects of chronic browsing on the life-history traits of large herbivores. We assessed the nutritional quality (crude protein [CP] contents) of staple foods, reproductive success, fawn recruitment, winter body mass, and body size in an introduced population of sika deer (Cervus nippon Temminck, 1938) on Nakanoshima Island, Lake Toya, Japan, which underwent repeated irruptions with shifting alternative foods and maintained high densities (>20 deer/km(2)). Our evaluation covered each irruptive dynamical phase, including initial irruption (Phase 1), second irruption (Phase 2), and subsequent phase (Phase 3). CP contents of staple foods (plum yew and litterfall in Phases 2 and 3, respectively) were at the same level as that of dwarf bamboo in Phase 1 during summer but were lower in autumn and winter, suggesting a decline in diet quality after initial irruption. The deer herd exhibited density-dependent changes in life-history traits, including delayed sexual maturity, lower fawn recruitment, and delayed body growth. The mean adult female (>= 3 years old) body mass in Phases 2-3 was marginally above the 50% pregnancy rate threshold. The deer herd tolerated substantial declines in food quality, which involved trade-offs between survival, growth, and reproduction as adaptations to life-history traits. This phenotypic plasticity is the main factor in maintaining high deer densities under severe food resource limitations. This suggests that the sika deer population will not reach equilibrium with their food resources without hunting or predators.

AB  - Non-native fish species may generate major ecological impacts on native assemblages. This study aims to assess the potential impact of the introduced Arapaima gigas on native fish assemblages in two oxbow lakes of the Bolivian Amazon. Stable isotope data were used to determine trophic position (TP) and isotopic niche overlap, to evaluate potential predation and competition interactions, respectively. Results suggest that A. gigas is more an omnivore than a top predator, as often claimed. Arapaima gigas occupied an intermediate TP between detritivore/herbivore and piscivore fish species and showed broader isotopic niche compared to most native species analysed. The isotopic niche of A. gigas significantly overlapped with most native fish species in one lake (i.e. Lake Mentiroso), while there was low niche overlap in the second (i.e. Lake Miraflores). Given its omnivorous tendencies, the predation impact of A. gigas on other fish species is likely less than currently claimed and likely varies with the food web structure of the ecosystem. More precise data on resource availability and use are necessary to infer whether niche overlap will have negative impacts on native fish species through potential competitive interactions. Increasing our understanding on the processes generating impact of these introductions on resident communities through food web ecology will pave the way for better resource management and conservation efforts.

AB  - As coral reefs face accelerating threats at global scales, examining how different coral species respond to local disruption from top-down and bottom-up forces can inform management at local scales. This may provide additional time for reducing global stressors. We conducted a full factorial experiment examining the effects of corallivory, herbivory, and fertilizer addition on 2 corals: Acropora pulchra and Porites rus, the former of which is faster-growing but more susceptible to predation, disease, and heat-induced mortality. Fertilizer addition enhanced corallivory but did not affect net coral growth. Consumer exclusion enhanced the net growth of A. pulchra by 18.1 times regardless of fertilizer treatment, while the net growth of P. rus did not differ among caging and fertilizer treatments. A. pulchra was rarely overgrown by algae regardless of treatment, while herbivore exclusion and fertilizer enrichment produced opposing effects on overgrowth of P. rus. In uncaged treatments, fertilizer enrichment led to greater herbivory but also 1.8 times greater algal overgrowth of P. rus relative to unfertilized treatments. However, in caged treatments, algal overgrowth of P. rus was 1.9 times higher in unfertilized versus fertilized treatments. Our results suggest that interactions between corallivory, herbivory, and fertilizer enrichment can have alternative effects on different coral species, with a hardier coral experiencing more negative impacts of fertilizer enrichment than a more sensitive coral, which was, in turn, more strongly suppressed by predation. Local stressors that disrupt top-down and bottom-up processes may increase the vulnerability of even the most robust corals, and it is these corals that have been predicted to become more common under future ocean scenarios.

AB  - A detailed knowledge of habitat use by bats is crucial for their effective conservation. Several studies have underlined the importance of forests for bats. This also holds for the European hot spot of bat diversity, the Mediterranean region, where human land use and, more recently, global warming, continue to promote a large-scale replacement of forests by sparsely wooded areas. To analyse how different bat species cope with this change in habitat availability, we studied bat activity and distribution on Asinara island, Sardinia. Call recordings were performed in different habitat types (forest, semi-open, open, settlement) and classified as echolocation, social call, or feeding, contacts. We checked for effects of habitat type, temperature, relative humidity, moonlight, and availability of potential prey insects on bat activity. Habitat type was the predominant factor explaining bat activity, which was highest at forest sites and lowest at open sites. Thus open-space foragers did not benefit from the ample presence of open areas. On the other hand, some edge and narrow space foragers reacted with habitat switching to forest loss. Thus, Rhinolophus hipposideros was predominant at semi-open sites, reflecting a flexible use of foraging habitats. Finally, contact types differed across habitat types with species-related preferences for social interactions and foraging activity. Our results suggest that sparsely wooded areas promote a change of bat community composition, and a loss of certain species, but also that a more balanced mix of habitat types by partial reforestation may help to maintain, and even increase, bat species diversity on Mediterranean islands.

AB  - The rapid expansion of tea plantations (Camellia sinensis), which replace local natural forests, decreases the water conservation function in the headwater region and threatens regional water security. However, studies focusing on the comprehensive evaluation and improvement of the water conservation function of natural forests and tea plantations are lacking. In this study, we developed a comprehensive evaluation method for the water conservation function by investigating, monitoring, and conducting process model simulations of 221 tea plantation and natural forest (bamboo forest) samples obtained in the field. We also quantified the trade-off between water conservation and carbon sequestration. The results showed that the tea plantations had lower annual water conservation than the bamboo forests. Slope was the most critical influential variable affecting water conservation in tea plantations. Strict control should be exercised in the development of steep slopes above 20 degrees for tea plantations, to enhance the regional water conservation capacity. Water conservation in bamboo forests increased to the maximum level at a planting density (SD) of approximately 2500-2700 tree/ha and then decreased quickly. The optimal SD values of bamboo forests were 2500, 2600, and 2650 trees/ha at slopes of 10 degrees, 15 degrees, and 20 degrees, respectively, which can maintain higher water conservation and adequate carbon sequestration. Overall, water conservation and carbon sequestration increased by approximately 22.6% and 13.7%, respectively, compared with the average values for bamboo forests. However, at slopes >20 degrees, a strong trade-off was observed between water conservation and carbon sequestration, and competing ecosystem services accompanied those, which were hard to balance and which resulted here in disproportionate water conservation at the cost of carbon sequestration loss.

AB  - Community structure is driven by the interaction of physical processes and biological interactions that can vary across environmental gradients and the strength of top-down control is expected to vary along gradients of primary productivity. In coastal marine systems, upwelling drives regional resource availability through the bottom-up effect of nutrient subsidies. This alters rates of primary production and is expected to alter algae-herbivore interactions in rocky intertidal habitats. Despite the potential for upwelling to alter these interactions, the interaction of upwelling and grazing pressure is poorly understood, particularly for warm-temperate systems. Using in situ herbivore exclusion experiments replicated across multiple upwelling regimes, we investigated the effects of both grazing pressure, upwelling, and their interactions on the sessile invertebrate community and biomass of macroalgal communities in a warm-temperate system. The sessile invertebrate cover showed indirect effects of grazing, being consistently low where algal biomass was high at upwelling sites and at nonupwelling sites when grazers were excluded. The macroalgal cover was greater at upwelling sites when grazers were excluded and there was a strong effect of succession throughout the experimental period. Grazing effects were greater at upwelling sites, particularly during winter months. There was a nonsignificant trend toward greater grazing pressure on early than later successional stages. Our results show that the positive bottom-up effects of nutrient supply on algal production do not overwhelm top-down control in this warm-temperate system but do have knock-on consequences for invertebrates that compete with macroalgae for space. We speculate that global increases in air and sea surface temperatures in warm-temperate systems will promote top-down effects in upwelling regions by increasing herbivore metabolic and growth rates.

AB  - Sika deer (Cervus nippon) populations have damaged habitats, agricultural crops, and commercial forests in many parts of the world, including Asia, Europe, northern America, and New Zealand. Population management of sika deer is an important task in those areas. To better understand large-scale management and improve management efficiency, the authors estimated spatio-temporal changes of density distribution and population dynamics of a managed population of sika deer on Kyushu Island (approximately 36,750 km(2)), Japan. The authors estimated these changes by using fecal pellet count surveys conducted from 1995 to 2019 and results from a vector autoregressive spatio-temporal model. No decreasing trend of populations were observed at the island and prefectural scales, even though the management goal has been to reduce the population by half, and harvesting on the island increased annually until it reached about 110,000 sika deer in 2014. A possible explanation for the stable population dynamics is that the population used to determine the harvest number under the prefectural management plan was originally underestimated. This study highlights not only the difficulties of wide-area management of sika deer but also three important factors for successful management: reducing the risk of management failure, using an adaptive management approach, and appropriate management scale.

AB  - Identifying the factors shaping dialects can reveal selective pressures and cultural influences on acoustic signals. Translocations of species have been considered the "gold standard" for identifying population differences in vocalizations, including dialects. The North American elk (Cervus canadensis) is a species that has experienced numerous translocations, but no published studies exist on dialects in elk or any other ungulate species. Adult male North American elk utter an iconic vocalization during the breeding season, which is termed the bugle call due to the power, duration, and pitch of the sound. We investigated if dialect differences existed between three populations: a source population in Wyoming (N = 10 bulls, 132 calls) and translocated populations in Colorado (N = 13 bulls, 92 calls) and Pennsylvania (N = 20 bulls, 160 calls). Dialect differences existed between the populations in 9 of 10 measured variables, in both the frequency domain and time domain. Habitat factors (acoustic adaptation hypothesis) affecting sound transmission were inconsistently related to dialects in the populations. Genetic factors may be related to dialects, as the historically bottlenecked Pennsylvania population, with low heterozygosity and low allelic richness, exhibited the least variability in acoustic measures. Cultural transmission and vocal learning may also contribute to dialect development in this highly vocal, social ungulate species.

AB  - Habitat selection theory suggests that environmental features selected at coarse scales reveal fundamental factors affecting animal fitness. When these factors vary across seasons, they may lead to large-scale movements, including long-distance seasonal migrations. We analyzed the seasonal habitat selection of 25 satellite-tracked Arctic hares from a population on Ellesmere Island (Nunavut, Canada) that relocated over 100 km in the fall. Since no other lagomorph is known to perform such extensive movements, this population offered an ideal setting to test animal movement and habitat selection theory. On summer grounds hares selected low elevation areas, while on winter grounds they selected high vegetation biomass, high elevation, and steep slopes. During fall relocation, they alternated between stopover and traveling behavioral states (ratio 2:1). Stopover locations were characterized by higher vegetation heterogeneity and lower rugosity than traveling locations, while vegetation biomass and elevation interacted to explain stopover locations in a more complex way. The selected combination of environmental features thus varied across seasons and behavioral states, in a way broadly consistent with predictions based on the changing food and safety needs of hares. Although causality was not demonstrated, our results improve our understanding of long-distance movements and habitat selection in Arctic hares, as well as herbivore ecology in the polar desert. Results also provide strong support to animal movement and habitat selection theory, by showing how some important hypotheses hold when tested in a species phylogenetically distinct from most animal models used in this research field.

AB  - Establishment of new populations is contingent on overcoming abiotic and biotic barriers. While this applies to all species, these hurdles are at the forefront of invasion biology where prediction, prevention, eradication, and control strategies depend on an understanding of these processes. Terrestrial Arundina graminifolia and epiphytic Dendrobium crumenatum are two non-indigenous orchids spreading throughout Puerto Rico. The two species have acquired a native herbivore and seed predator, the orchid-specialist weevil, Stethobaris polita. With recently acquired presence records of the three species, land cover data and downscaled climate variables, we modeled their potential distributions under current conditions and also those projected under the least and most extreme climate scenarios for 2050 and 2070. We show that D. crumenatum flourishes in urban environments which also provide refugia from S. polita, whereas there is currently limited refugia for A. graminifolia from S. polita attack, as this orchid has similar climatic niches as the weevil. Projections into all climate scenarios suggest range retractions for all species, with a decreased extent of both orchid populations subject to S. polita attack. Thus, we illustrate for island invasions how climate change will likely alter the distribution of acquired biotic interactions.

AB  - Pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherer populations were fully integrated in natural systems, they played an ecological role as top predators affecting food web dynamics according to predator-prey models, through which they maintained and controlled prey species numbers. However, human abilities to adapt to changing environments and different habitats as well as their capacity to expand, allowed them to occupy new environments in a formidable short lapse of time, where potential preys were unable to defend themselves against such a powerful predator. Humans were the origin of megafauna extinction in the America continent and other regions. But it was since Neolithic times, at the end of the last glacial period, when a huge change took place as humans started to manage and change the local environment through incipient crop cultivation and animal breeding. The ecological role of humans changed dramatically because, as technological advances progressed, as well as their survival rate and the ability to withstand severe weather conditions, they became a powerful species with the ability to alter all the environments and the eventual capacity to destroy them, often unintentionally. Further, humans have moved and introduced alien species across the world, causing unexpected outcomes, some of them seriously deleterious for the host fauna and flora. Currently, humans are increasingly concerned about land degradation and global warming effects and see the necessity of undertaking habitat restoration and promoting the so-called rewilding processes, including the reintroduction of wild grazers and large predators to attempt restore original food webs. An ecologically-driven human hunting activity may help in this restoration process, occupying top predators' empty niches and promoting rural development through the sustainable use of the hunting resource.

AB  - Aim Lepidoptera is a highly diverse, predominantly herbivorous insect order, with species transported to outside their native range largely facilitated by the global trade of plants and plant-based goods. Analogous to island disharmony, we examine invasion disharmony, where species filtering during invasions increases systematic compositional differences between native and non-native species assemblages, and test whether some families are more successful at establishing in non-native regions than others. Location Hawaii, North America, Galapagos, Europe, South Africa, South Korea, Japan, Nansei Islands, Ogasawara Islands, Australia, New Zealand. Taxon Lepidoptera. Methods We compared numbers of non-native, unintentionally introduced Lepidoptera species with the land area of 11 regions worldwide. Differences among native and non-native assemblages in the distribution of species among families were investigated using ordination analysis. We tested whether invasion disharmony is explained by propagule pressure (proxied by species richness in border interceptions) and if families were associated with specific trade commodities. Results In total, 741 non-native Lepidoptera species, accounting for 0.47% of the global diversity of lepidopterans, are established in at least one of the 11 regions. Crambidae, Pyralidae, Tineidae and Gracillariidae were particularly successful invaders, whereas the two most species-rich families, Erebidae and Geometridae, were under-represented among non-native Lepidoptera. Much of the variation in species numbers in the native, and less so in the non-native assemblages could be attributed to land area. Although native assemblages were similar among nearby regions, non-native assemblages were not, suggesting geography had little effect on invasion disharmony. Comparison of established with intercepted species revealed that macromoth families were generally under-represented in establishments, whereas several micromoth families were under-represented in interceptions. This discrepancy may relate to greater detectability of larger species or high propagule pressure via associations with specific invasion pathways. Main conclusions Invasion disharmony in Lepidoptera appears to be driven by processes unrelated to the success of native assemblages. While native assemblages developed through long-term evolutionary radiation, the composition of non-native assemblages is driven by differential invasion pathways and traits affecting the establishment of founder populations that vary among families.

AB  - In the European Union, African swine fever (ASF) affects wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations in several Member States. Knowledge of population connectivity is important for the implementation of control measures, in particular the establishment of effective barriers. Population genetic comparisons of neighbouring populations can be very helpful in this respect. The present study investigated the genetic differentiation of wild boar in eastern Germany. This region has been affected by ASF since September 2020. A total of 1,262 wild boars from 31 hunting grounds (populations) in ASF-affected and ASF-free districts were sampled over a total area of almost 100,000 km(2). The study area encompassed a network of geographical factors that promote (roads, rivers, cities) or inhibit (natural areas, habitat corridors) genetic differentiation between wild boar populations. The genetic differentiation of the areas was based on 12 microsatellite markers. Three different Bayesian algorithms were used to analyse the data. The results were combined into a common approach with 9 clusters. Based on the cluster distribution in each population, the connectivity between the areas was quantified. The strongest differentiation was found along an imaginary line along the lower Elbe valley through Berlin and the A11 freeway to the Szczecin Lagoon. In contrast, the Mecklenburg Lake District and the south-east of the study area showed strong connectivity between areas. The special features of the landscapes along the lower Elbe valley, which was assessed as highly connective, and the high barrier effect of the A11 freeway in contrast to the other freeways in the study area show that barrier effects cannot be generalised in principle, but are actually determined by the circumstances of individual structures. The results of the connectivity analysis were compared with the distribution of viral lineages and variants. The genotypes of the wild boar populations and the ASFV lineages and variants showed a good explanatory approach for the observed disease dynamics in the study area. The newly gained knowledge on barriers and regionally different connectivity between wild boar populations can support considerations and measures for the containment of ASF in the affected areas by improving the understanding of wild boar dispersal dynamics.

AB  - Invasive species pose a major threat to global diversity, and once they are well established their eradication typically becomes unfeasible. However, certain natural mechanisms can increase the resistance of native communities to invaders and can be used to guide effective management policies. Both competition and herbivory have been identified as potential biotic resistance mechanisms that can limit plant invasiveness, but it is still under debate to what extent they might be effective against well-established invaders. Surprisingly, whereas biotic mechanisms are known to interact strongly, most studies to date have examined single biotic mechanisms separately, which likely influences our understanding of the strength and effectiveness of biotic resistance against invaders. Here we use long-term field data, benthic assemblage sampling, and exclusion experiments to assess the effect of native assemblage complexity and herbivory on the invasion dynamics of a successful invasive species, the alga Caulerpa cylindracea. A higher complexity of the native algal assemblage limited C. cylindracea invasion, probably through competition by canopy-forming and erect algae. Additionally, high herbivory pressure by the fish Sarpa salpa reduced C. cylindracea abundance by more than four times. However, long-term data of the invasion reflects that biotic resistance strength can vary across the invasion process and it is only where high assemblage complexity is concomitant with high herbivory pressure, that the most significant limitation is observed (synergistic effect). Overall, the findings reported in this study highlight that neglecting the interactions between biotic mechanisms during invasive processes and restricting the studied time scales may lead to underestimations of the true capacity of native assemblages to develop resistance to invaders.

AB  - Fenced sanctuaries that exclude feral predators are critical for threatened species conservation. However, adaptive management of these sanctuaries requires careful consideration of the potential impact herbivore populations free from predation can have on the condition of native vegetation. The Mulligans Flat Woodland Sanctuary in the Australian Capital Territory comprises Critically Endangered box-gum grassy woodland, threatened orchids, abundant macropods, and a reintroduced population of the Eastern Bettong (Bettongia gaimardi, hereafter "Ngaluda"). To understand how Ngaluda, along with other herbivores, may be potentially impacting vegetation across the sanctuary, we undertook an assessment of indicator plant species. We monitored 106 plots for 13 indicator species (10 species with tuberous roots that the burrowing Ngaluda would be preferentially targeting and three non-tuberous species). We found that most floristic indicators we investigated - including richness of indicator species and the abundance of lilies - were higher in the Goorooyarroo area of the sanctuary (where Ngaluda are absent and wallabies are rare) compared to the Mulligans Flat area of the sanctuary (where Ngaluda are present and wallabies are abundant), suggesting a negative impact of the overall herbivore assemblage of Mulligans Flat. However, within just Mulligans Flat, some indicators, including the abundance of a common orchid, were significantly lower in areas associated with high Ngaluda activity irrespective of other herbivore densities. We found no instance of Ngaluda presence or higher activity being associated with higher values for any floristic indicator we investigated. These results are consistent with known impacts of abundant herbivores and reintroduced digging marsupials in other predator-free sanctuaries in Australia. Our results highlight that Ngaluda herbivory may be outweighing any positive effect of their diggings on native vegetation and indicate the need for careful risk mitigation when deciding how critically endangered animals and vegetation communities are managed together in sanctuaries.

AB  - Biodiversity on an island presents complicated and unexpected patterns of evolution. Ulleungdo Island is a well-known example of such an oceanic island. Most systematic and evolutionary studies of Ulleungdo Island have focused on endemic species, for which the ancestral population derived from the mainland isolated and ultimately evolved into a distinct species. To gain a better understanding of the origin of the biodiversity of Ulleungdo, non-endemic taxa on the island should also be examined. Daphniphyllum macropodum, distributed in warm-temperate regions in China, Taiwan, Korea, and Japan, is an evergreen tree commonly found in the maritime broad-leaf vegetation on Ulleungdo. Thirty-two populations of D. macropodum from Ulleungdo and other areas in Korea and Japan and its close relative D. teijsmannii were included in a phylogeographic analysis using nuclear ITS and chloroplast DNA regions. Each species was found to form a distantly related monophyletic group in the MP trees based on the ITS data. In contrast, the chloroplast DNA data showed that the clade of D. macropodum was mixed with certain samples of D. teijsmannii. Some individuals of D. macropodum on Ulleungdo and those on southeastern Honshu consist of haplotypes typically found in D. teijsmannii. Our results suggest that some of the D. macropodum on Ulleungdo Island likely derived via introgression between D. teijsmannii and D. macropodum and that D. teijsmannii, currently not distributed on Ulleungdo, likely served as the maternal source. Our results also imply that plants of D. macropodum in the Kanto region derived independently from introgression between D. teijsmannii and D. macropodum with different maternal parents.

AB  - Marine herbivores face rapid changes in the coastal ecosystems where they forage. In the Caribbean, the recent and fast expansion of the invasive phanerogam species Halophila stipulacea is threatening native seagrass ecosystems. So far, H. stipulacea is escaping most Caribbean herbivores, certainly because of its recent introduction or lower nutritional value. We investigated the impact of H. stipulacea invasion on fine-scale foraging habitat selection and food resource selection of immature green turtles at critical foraging sites in Les Anses d'Arlet, Martinique. The analysis of seagrass distribution and nutritional content, together with turtle behaviour and resource selection, showed that H. stipulacea may be of contrasting interest to green turtles. Compositional analysis confirmed the lower nutritional value of H. stipulacea compared to the native species, but the invasive species showed higher digestibility than native ones, which calls into question the energetic advantage of consuming the native plants over the exotic plant. Thus, although green turtles mostly selected the native seagrass Thalassia testudinum in multispecies seagrass beds, some individuals fed on H. stipulacea. Accordingly, in bays entirely invaded by H. stipulacea, one possibility for resident green turtles is to increase foraging on this species, but, if so, the consequences on their growth and survival still remain to be determined. As the expansion of H. stipulacea may have been facilitated by factors such as shipping, anchor scarring and fishing activities, protection of native seagrass beds and immature green turtles from human disturbances is urgently required to ensure the long-term adaptation of green turtles to this new foraging environment.

AB  - Introduction: In tropical forests, populations of medium and large mammals are being impacted by human activities. Understanding how species respond to land use conversion, fragmentation, and the encroachment of roads density and settlements is of conservation interest in highly biodiverse regions. Objetive: To assess the effect of human disturbance and environmental variables on trophic guilds of medium and large mammals in the tropical forests of the Sierra Negra-Mazateca in southern Mexico. Methods: We characterized the landscape (land use and vegetation, number of fragments, and edge density) through supervised classification of Landsat 8 images. We recorded species using camera-trap stations and evaluated the relationship between the presence and relative abundance of species with human disturbance variables using zero-inflated regression models. Results: The landscape of the Sierra Negra-Mazateca is dominated by fragments of secondary forests (48.6 %) with a small proportion of primary forests (9.6 %). We found no differences in the overall relative abundance of species between primary and secondary forests, but differences were observed for omnivore and carnivore guilds. Human disturbances had a disparate effect among guilds, negatively affecting carnivores and positively herbivores. Conclusions: Secondary forests are refuges for tolerant species. Nevertheless, we emphasize the need to conserve primary forests and safeguard medium and large mammals, especially the carnivore guild. Extensive management in secondary forests is recommended to conserve remaining primary forests, alongside community awareness and empowerment for coexistence with wildlife.

AB  - The rapid decline of species is an alarming issue that needs immediate attention. With this in mind, the Red List and Green List were introduced by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to provide baseline information concerning the statuses of wildlife in their range. In this study, field and participatory surveys spanning two decades were combined to reassess priorities, threats, and risks for marine species in Balikpapan Bay, Indonesia. Briefly, 11 marine species were recorded, with a total of 561 geo-tagged records. The only difference between the field surveys and the respondent estimates was the projected number of individuals for each species. Although the diversity and evenness values were relatively high in the marine zone, they indicated stability within populations because the species were distributed uniformly. In contrast, the results of the InVEST HRA model indicated a greater risk from fishing (65.72%) and coastal development (54.68%) when approaching the interior of the river in the riverine zone. These human activities may have been responsible for the declining-absence of dugong populations from 2001-2019. Overall, the reality of this threat is severe and much more alarming than the dugong's 'vulnerable' status on the IUCN Red List. Although spatial planning enhances local and global species recoveries, the existing conservation strategies seem outdated. Revision is needed, and the pace could increase with proposals of regular monitoring. Timely modifications could be made with these strategies until satisfaction (i.e., species recovery) is reached at Balikpapan Bay, Indonesia.

AB  - Spatial neophobia and exploration are often assessed in nonhuman animals by measuring behavioral responses to novel environments. These traits may especially affect the performance of individuals translocated to novel environments for conservation purposes. Here, we present methods to administer and analyze a minimally invasive novel environment test that accounts for the social context of focal individuals. We used an aerial platform to capture video footage of a captive herd of scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah) entering an unfamiliar enclosure. We analyzed footage for seven individually identifiable oryx, scoring their behavioral responses (i.e., latency to enter the enclosure, and movement and posture after entering the enclosure) and social context (i.e., relative position and number of nearby animals). We performed a principal components analysis (PCA) to explore individual traits and responses, and used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to determine the effect of individual traits and social context on individual posture and movement behaviors. Both PCA and GLMMs supported our expectation that social context affects individual behavior: high neighbor density and relative position were negatively related to individual movement, and variation in social context was positively related with head-up postures and movement. Oryx were well differentiated along two principal components that reflected (1) vigilance or caution, and (2) changing social context and age. These methods provide a framework for assessing individual responses to a novel environment in a group setting, which can inform reintroduction and wildlife management efforts, while minimizing interference with animal behavior and management operations.

AB  - Herbivory can threaten the persistence of palatable plant species and the fauna communities dependent upon diverse and structurally complex post-fire regeneration. This study compared the introduction success of the nationally Endangered Chalky Wattle (Acacia cretacea) in the South Australian mallee under different fire and browsing treatments. Recruitment from both seed and seedlings was enhanced by fire and was absolutely conditional on protection from herbivory, even though domestic stock were excluded and numbers of kangaroos, goats and rabbits were lower than regional averages. Several other fire-responsive plant species, including the ecologically important Porcupine Grass or spinifex (Triodia irritans), which provides habitat for threatened fauna, also benefited from herbivore exclusion. Conservation of wild populations of Chalky Wattle and other palatable fire-responsive plants, and the ecosystem processes they enable, is likely to be conditional on significant and sustained reduction in herbivore populations, especially kangaroos, following wildfires or control burns in the mallee.

AB  - The causes of megafauna extinction in the late Quaternary have long been a controversial subject, which may be related to the limitations of adequate information to evaluate global hypotheses related to climate change and the impacts of modern human dispersal. We propose a new global spatio-temporal approach using variations of Earth's orbital parameters and atmospheric CO2 levels as forcing factors for environmental and climate change with worldwide distribution. We analysed the overlap between 142 times-of-extinction of megafauna, and high obliquity (as a forcing factor for seasonality), low atmospheric CO2 levels (as a forcing factor for desertification), and the arrival of modern humans. We found that critical periods of seasonality and desertification intensified in the last 800 ka BP, and made the last 50 ka BP exceptionally severe in relation to the entire Quaternary. These critical periods significantly overlapped with 87% of extinctions in continental and connected islands, compared with 32.1% overlap of extinctions with the arrival of modern humans. In contrast the arrival of modern humans on isolated islands overlapped with 90.9% of the extinctions. The arrival of modern humans in continental regions had 81.3% of overlap with critical periods of climate change, suggesting that the synchrony observed between extinctions and the dispersal of modern humans in continental regions was driven by climate.

The predator-prey interaction clearly demon-strates how young individuals of hyper herbivores become vulnerable to African lions during long periods of extreme drought. And when the same age class is suppressed seasonally, year after year, populations can be drastically reduced by not incorporating reproductively active in-dividuals. So, for years I looked for data that represented the seasonality and drought conditions at the time the extinctions occurred. That's why I also thank Michael Palmer who, in a forum, proposed to help Ralph Ellis publish "the best explanation about what triggers glaciations"; with this study I learned a lot about the importance of orbital cycles I use in this study. I also thank my brother, Rafael Graipel, and several re-searchers with whom I had the opportunity to discuss the extinction of megafauna.

AB  - In the debate about tree species suited to cope with the ongoing global changes, Sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) is frequently discussed as a potentially future-proof tree species for Central Europe. This is mainly due to its current southern distribution range, which climatically corresponds to what is expected for Central Europe in the near future. Present chestnut forests are, however, the result of historic long-term intensive management, which has extended and partially obscured the species' natural ecological range and autecology. Therefore, knowledge about the competitiveness and suitability of chestnut for future conditions is still poor. Here, we analysed data of the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI) for Southern Switzerland to compare the survival probability of chestnut to other co-occurring tree species and detect drivers of chestnut mortality under natural dynamics including the Asian Chestnut Gall Wasp (Dryocosmus kuriphilus) using survival models, such as the Kaplan-Meier estimator and the Cox-Proportional Hazards model.
   Despite the potential longevity of cultivated chestnuts, under natural conditions the survival curves rank the chetsnut among short-lived and light-demanding tree species, especially for individuals smaller than 50 cm diameter at breast height. Moreover, the survival models confirm the pioneer-like characteristics of the chestnut tree such as its low shade tolerance and poor competitiveness in comparison to late-successional species. The mortality probability of chestnut increases when growing under dry conditions and under grazing pressure from goats, while fire disturbances have a positive effect on survival. Severe damage due to repeated D. kuriphilus attacks represents an additional significant factor of increased chestnut mortality risk.
   Our results suggest that chestnut is not per se a future-proof tree species. Rather, forest managers should be aware that chestnut might not be the best option to face expected rises in summer temperatures and dry periods on xeric site conditions, whereas the species can be considered on good site conditions when regular silvicultural management is provided.

AB  - To compensate for mineral deficiencies in food sources, numerous ungulate species use various methods, such as salt licking, soil ingestion, and gnawing on antlers or bones. While osteophagia, the act of gnawing on antlers or bones, is well-documented in cervid species, it has only been observed in sika deer (Cervus nippon) on Mageshima Island in southern Japan despite their widespread distribution. This study aimed to provide an initial account of the observations of osteophagia in sika deer from central Japan. One of the 15 camera traps deployed in the Hakone Nature Forest of Tamagawa University for wildlife monitoring serendipitously captured multiple instances of adult female sika deer gnawing on a four-tined antler on July 9th and 16th in 2018. These occurrences coincided with the fawning season of the species during which mineral deficiencies in the diet are prevalent, suggesting that osteophagia serves as a response to nutrient deficiencies in the diet of sika deer in central Japan. Thus, systematic surveys may yield additional evidence of this behavior in sika deer across diverse geographical areas given the absence of studies on osteophagia in sika deer conducted in other regions.

AB  - State of the art Theory predicts that herbivore pressure should be weaker on islands than on the mainland, owing to lower herbivore abundance and diversity because of dispersal constraints and environmental filtering. As a result, plants on islands should invest less in defences against herbivory. Although early empirical studies supported these predictions, recent systematic island-mainland comparisons have questioned this paradigm, with some studies reporting either no difference between islands and mainland or higher herbivory and plant defences on islands. Current data therefore appear to be unsupportive of predictions on insularity effects on plant-herbivore interactions, calling for more research to reassess predictions and to test underlying mechanisms for observed patterns. Research opportunities To meet this challenge, a renewed research programme based on the accrual of studies with specific features is needed. These should include more robust experimental designs with replication within and across systems, integrative and more nuanced assessments of plant defensive phenotypes and herbivory, a food web approach that considers the multi-trophic context in which plant-herbivore interactions are embedded, and a consideration of historical factors (e.g., island origin and biogeographical factors, defensive anachronisms). Outlook This new research programme will require integration of evolutionary ecology research on plant-herbivore interactions with island biogeography, palaeoecology and community ecology to understand the influence of factors acting at different scales, from local factors driving herbivory and plant defences to historical processes and regional drivers of species composition determining species traits and their interactions.

AB  - On large management units where terrain allows observation of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from the air, helicopter surveys may provide managers with cost-effective and accurate estimates of population abundance; however, imperfect detection of deer introduces negative bias. This can result in potentially inappropriate management recommendations (e.g., harvest prescriptions). Sightability estimators are designed to model detection heterogeneity based on factors that affect observer detection of target animals. Sightability models are widely used to estimate ungulate abundance; however, previous researchers have developed sightability models using radio-collared animals, potentially introducing bias during model development attributed to unaccounted for movement between initial and follow-up flights. Therefore, our objectives were to model detection probability using surrogates of white-tailed deer as a function of covariates including distance from transect, vegetative obstruction, and light conditions to improve population estimates derived from helicopter surveys and apply our final sightability model in operational helicopter surveys. We conducted our study in 2019 on a 399.4-km(2) study area within a 1,210-km(2) cattle ranch in central Florida, USA. We placed 3-dimensional archery targets as surrogates for white-tailed deer at assigned locations unknown to observers across a combination of stratified bins of vegetative obstruction and distances from the transect. Our top model indicated that distance from the transect and vegetative obstruction negatively affected detection of deer. Detection probability on the flight transect ranged from 0.95 (95% CI = 0.89-0.98) for vegetative obstruction 0-25% and distance from transect 0-25 m to 0.05 (95% CI = 0.01-0.18) for vegetative obstruction 76-100% and distance from transect 100-125 m. We applied our sightability model to operational surveys on 3 units, which produced population estimates averaging 26% higher than those derived from uncorrected counts. Observers simultaneously recorded live deer during operational flights, of which 60% of deer groups were observed while stationary. Our methods using stationary surrogates to develop region-specific sightability models could be used in other study areas to account for imperfect detection of white-tailed deer.

AB  - Tree climbing is an extremely rare behavior among ungulates and has rarely been reported in forest-dwelling ungulates. We collected 15 tree-climbing records of Formosan serows, mainly from social media platforms. They climbed trees to forage throughout the year in many locations in Taiwan. This is the first report of tree-climbing behavior in the Formosan serow, which is typically a forest dweller. Ungulates are terrestrial herbivores, basically adapted to running fast on the ground; tree-climbing behavior has been reported only in seven species, and five of them live in open habitats (Capra hircus, C. aegagrus, C. falconeri, C. cylindricornis, Oreotragus oreotragus). Tree-climbing behavior may also be evolved in ungulates inhabiting dense forests with abundant trees; however, this has rarely been reported in such species (Moschus leucogaster, M. moschiferus), probably due to the difficulty of observing in the wild. The numerous publicly available records in social networks hold potentially valuable information on the atypical behaviors of wild ungulates. Here, we explored the tree-climbing behavior of a forest-dwelling ungulate, the Formosan serow in Taiwan, a subtropical island, by extracting information from online social media platforms. We researched images and videos of Formosan serows through Facebook and YouTube and collected a total of 15 tree-climbing events. In these materials, Formosan serows climbed 10 tree species, including evergreen coniferous and broad-leaved trees, and a variety of parts, ranging in height from 0.6 to 4 m, and from branches of shrubs to trunks of tall trees. Tree-climbing behavior was recorded throughout Taiwan and from lowlands to subalpine zones, suggesting that tree climbing may be a common behavior in this species. Foraging while climbing trees was frequently observed (53.3%), suggesting that the purpose or benefit for climbing is to obtain additional food other than plants growing near the ground surface. In contrast to other tree-climbing ungulates, Formosan serows climbed trees not only in winter, but also in other seasons, when food is relatively abundant. This is the first scientific report of tree-climbing behavior in the Formosan serow that is typically a forest dweller.

AB  - Though mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) persist in robust populations throughout most of their North American distribution, habitat loss, unregulated hunting, and other factors have reduced their historical range in Mexico. Two of the 6 putative subspecies inhabiting Mexico's deserts and Baja California peninsula are of conservation concern, occupying islands in the Pacific Ocean (Odocoileus hemionus cerrosensis on Cedros Island: endangered) and Sea of Cortes (Odocoileus hemionus sheldoni on Tiburon Island: threatened). Focusing on the desert southwest (n = 448), we sampled Tiburon (n = 22) and Cedros (n = 15) Island mule deer using contemporary samples and natural history museum specimens to complete a phylogeographic evaluation of the species complex, and assess the phylogeography of these insular subspecies. Both insular subspecies formed endemic haplotype lineages, consistent with island biogeographic theory. Bayesian skyline plots were consistent with Holocene demographic expansion. Cedros Island deer were genetically most similar to adjacent mainland Baja California deer, but exhibited a suite of unique haplotypes and reduced genetic variation. Tiburon Island deer haplotypes unexpectedly nested within a mainland lineage found in distant New Mexico, rather than the adjacent mainland Sonoran lineage. Such findings suggest the importance of postglacial climate fluctuations and biotic community turnover in the phylogeographic history of mule deer in the desert southwest. Our genetic data corroborates cultural, archaeological, and phenotypic evidence supporting Cedros and Tiburon deer endemicity and subspecies status. Reduced genetic variation, divergence from mainland populations, and demographic trends on both islands indicate that conservation, monitoring, and management are critical to ensure persistence of these endemic insular subspecies.

AB  - Simple Summary Ecosystem services (ESs) and disservices (EDs) are routinely estimated from changes in service provider densities without measuring their actual levels. By using the sentinel approach (i.e., exposing a plant, seeds, and prey models in a standardized way), we tested how coriander (Coriandrum sativum) strips planted in mixed orchards on Terceira Island (Azores, Portugal) affected ESs/EDs via herbivory on lettuce plants, seed predation on wheat and weed seeds, and predation on artificial caterpillars. Vertebrates had more influence than invertebrates on ESs and EDs. Herbivory (ED) after 2 weeks was similar in the coriander and the control plots, while seed predation was higher in the control than in the coriander plots on both wheat grain (an ED: 30.8% vs. 15.3%) and weed seeds (an ES: 2.5% vs. 0.4%). Vertebrate predation (ES) rates after 48 h were significantly higher in the control (9%) than in the coriander plots (3%), while no difference was observed for invertebrate predation. Coriander strips did not support increased ES/reduced ED levels in this habitat. The sentinel approach is effective to quantitatively compare multiple ESs/EDs under different farming management strategies. The effect of flower strips on ecosystem services (ESs) and disservices (EDs) is routinely assessed following changes in service provider densities without measuring the associated levels of ES/EDs. By using the sentinel approach (i.e., exposing a plant, seeds, and prey models in a standardized way), we tested how coriander (Coriandrum sativum) strips planted in mixed orchards on Terceira Island (Azores, Portugal) affected herbivory on lettuce plants, seed predation on wheat and weed seeds, and predation on artificial caterpillars. Vertebrates had more influence than invertebrates on ESs/EDs. Herbivory (ED) after 2 weeks was similar in the coriander and the control plots (mean & PLUSMN; SD; 2.3% & PLUSMN; 3.3% vs. 2.2% & PLUSMN; 2.9%, n = 32 for both). Seed predation was higher in the control than in the coriander plots for both grain (ED; 30.8% & PLUSMN; 38.9% vs. 15.3% & PLUSMN; 10.8%, n = 18 for both) and weed seeds (ES; 2.5% & PLUSMN; 4.1% vs. 0.4% & PLUSMN; 0.5%, n = 18 for both). Vertebrate predation (ES) rates after 48 h were significantly higher in the control (estimate 9%, 95% CI: 4-20%) than in the coriander plots (3%, 1-8%), while no difference was observed for invertebrate predation. Coriander strips did not support increased ES/reduced ED levels in this setting. The tools used can be effective to quantitatively compare multiple ESs/EDs under different farming management strategies.

AB  - The success of non-native species in novel environments has received worldwide attention, resulting in dozens of hypotheses trying to explain this demographic success. Unfortunately, most hypotheses are built on little empirical data, and evaluations often come to contradictory conclusions, even when exploring the same mechanisms or species in different contexts. The focus on species as the unit of inquiry may impede progress because intraspecific diversity (including variation among populations) can be as profound and of a similar magnitude as interspecific variation. We explored how origin, residence time and population may affect competitive ability, spread (i.e. invasiveness), and impact (on local plant communities) using non-native Phragmites australis australis and native Phragmites australis americanus in long-term experiments (8-12 years) in a common garden and at field sites in New York State, USA. Non-native P. australis australis spread faster and, despite inter-population variation, all populations were competitively superior to native P. australis americanus. Non-native and native genotypes were taller and competitively superior to other herbaceous wetland plants, confirming well-established generalizations about wetland plant assembly and traits (height, biomass) associated with competitive dominance. However, non-native genotypes more strongly reduced wetland plant diversity. While traits associated with competitive ability and ecological dominance are well known, the mechanisms that allow non-native genotypes to be more invasive and to outcompete both other wetland plants and native Phragmites genotypes remain unclear. Improved photosynthetic capacity and below-ground resource capture are likely mechanisms. Synthesis. Non-native P. australis australis is considered one of the most troublesome species in North American wetlands while native genotypes are declining. Our work confirms evidence from across North America indicating non-native P. australis australis superior competitive ability and inter-population variation. While native genotypes are competitively superior to other herbaceous wetland plant species, they are unable to persist once non-native genotypes establish.Read the free for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Aspen forests provide wildlife, watershed, and aesthetic value, and the potential for reduced fire occurrence, behavior, and severity. There is interest in planting aspen to achieve various management objectives. However, few studies have investigated the optimal conditions for aspen seedlings in the western US. We conducted two experiments to address this knowledge gap. First, we tested the effects of shading structures (i.e., logs) and biochar on the survival and growth of 960 outplanted aspen seedlings in three exclosures in a recent fire footprint. Second, we tested whether experimentally placing logs near 120 naturally-occurring post-fire aspen seedlings affected survival or growth. Survival of outplanted seedlings was high (66%) despite hot and dry conditions in the years of the study. Logs and biochar had minimal effects on planted seedling survival and growth, but in one exclosure, survival of planted seedlings was lower in log and log + biochar treatments, likely due to the protection logs provided to small mammalian herbivores. Survival was higher for naturally-occurring seedlings with logs placed on the south side compared to control seedlings in one site, and growth was higher for naturally-occurring seedlings with a nearby log, but not significantly so. In sites where aspen seedling survival and growth are relatively robust, management actions to modify the microsite may not be necessary.

AB  - Monitoring is essential for evidence-based wildlife conservation and management. Conventional distance sampling (CDS) represents a methodology of election for population assessment of large herbivores. CDS requires that (1) animals' distribution is uniform around the transects and (2) transects must be randomly distributed over the study area. Monitoring costs are usually lower by using cars moving along dirty roads, instead of walking randomly located transects, but this choice may introduce biases in the estimate, as ungulates may avoid roads, which in their turn are not randomly distributed across the landscape. To address both problems, we used bivariate distance sampling (collecting both forward and perpendicular distances) to estimate detection probability, thus correcting for road avoidance. The resulting detection function is used as input for Density Surface Models to correct for non-random line placement. We demonstrate this methodology by considering a pilot survey of impala (Aepyceros melampus) and common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia) in the Sandwe GMA (Zambia). Potentially, this approach can mitigate biases and increase the precision of estimates. We discuss the possibility of applying the proposed methodology for routine wildlife monitoring in underfunded areas, in Africa and elsewhere. To assist practitioners, we provide an easy-to-use R script which implements statistical procedures.

AB  - To understand how nutrient cycling and sequestration are influenced by different grazing periods, the C:N:P stoichiometry features of the plant-soil interface in the desert steppe were measured and evaluated. The 5-year seasonal grazing experiment employed four grazing period treatments: traditional time of grazing (TG), early termination of grazing (EG), delayed start of grazing (DG), and delayed start and early termination of grazing (DEG). Additionally, fenced off desert steppe served as the control. The grazing periods each had a differing impact on the C:N:P stoichiometry in both plant functional group and soil depth comparisons. Compared to the EG, DG, and DEG treatments, the TG treatment had a more significant impact on the C, N, and P pools of grass, as well as the C:P and N:P ratios of forbs, but had a reduced effect on the C:P and N:P ratios of legumes. In contrast to plants, the DG treatment exhibited greater advantages in increasing C pools within the 0-40 cm soil layer. Furthermore, in the 10-20 cm soil layer, the C:P and N:P ratios under the EG treatment were significantly higher, ranging from 8.88% to 53.41% and 72.34%-121.79%, respectively, compared to the other treatments (TG, DG, and DGE). The primary drivers of the C, N, and P pools during different grazing periods were above-ground biomass (AGB) and litter biomass (LB). Both lowering the plant C:P and N:P ratios and considerably raising the plant P pool during different grazing periods greatly weakened the P limitation of the desert steppe environment. It is predicted that delayed start grazing might be a management strategy for long-term ecosystem sustainability, as it regulates above-ground nutrient allocation and has a positive effect on soil C and N pools.

AB  - Eld's deer Rucervus eldii (McClelland, 1842) is an ungulate that lives in tropical lowland forests in several countries of Indochina and Hainan Island of China. Its remaining population is small and scattered, and the species is listed as an Endangered species on the IUCN Red List. The debate over the taxonomic status of the Hainan population has persisted for over a century-as an island-endemic subspecies R. e. hainanus, or an insular population of the subspecies R. e. siamensis, would have significant conservation implications. And, given the Hainan population had experienced both population bottleneck and multiple translocations in the past, conservation genomics would be a powerful tool to evaluate the genetic impacts of these events. In this study, we used conservation genomics assessment to study population differentiation and genetic diversity of R. e. siamensis in Cambodia and three Eld's deer subpopulations on Hainan Island. Based on the unique genetic profile and demographic analysis, this study corroborated previous studies using genetic markers that the Hainan Eld's deer warrants the taxonomic status of a distinct subspecies. The Hainan population exhibits a reduction in genetic diversity and an increase in the level of inbreeding when compared to the population of Cambodia. The signs of purifying selection were found against homozygous loss-of-function mutations to decrease the deleterious burden in the Hainan population. However, there was an accumulation of more deleterious missense mutations. Furthermore, significant differences in genetic diversity and level of inbreeding found among the three Hainan subpopulations indicated population isolation and suboptimal translocation strategies, which calls for urgent, coordinated, and science-based genetic management to ensure the long-term viability of the endemic subspecies hainanus. This study provides guidance for the conservation and management of Eld's deer.

AB  - The knowledge regarding the spatial ecology of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in different environments is crucial if effective management actions are to be designed. However, this knowledge continues to be scarce in the complex contexts of mixed land use and management circumstances. This study describes the spatial ecology of red deer monitored using GPS collars in Mediterranean ecosystems of South-Central Spain, considering the effect of individual and seasonal (food shortage period, rut, hunting season and food abundance period) factors on different land use and management scenarios, namely protected areas, mixed farms and fenced hunting estates. Our results showed less activity (ACT), a shorter daily range (DR) and a smaller home range (HR) during the food shortage period: ACT: 0.38 +/- (SD) 0.12; DR: 3010.9 +/- 727.3 m; and weekly HR: 122.2 +/- 59.6 ha. With regard to land use, individuals were less ACT and had a smaller DR on fenced hunting estates (ACT: 0.24 +/- 0.12; DR: 1946.3 +/- 706.7 m) than in protected areas (ACT: 0.59 +/- 0.12; DR: 4071.4 +/- 1068.2 m) or on mixed farms (ACT: 0.57 +/- 0.29; DR: 5431.1 +/- 1939.5 m) in all the periods studied. Red deer selected land cover with forage and shelter when foraging and resting, respectively. When drive hunt events occurred (mixed farms and fenced hunting estates), the deer were more prone to select safer habitats (scrublands) and avoid open areas (crops or grasslands) than were their counterparts in protected areas. The patterns observed can be explained by sexual and seasonal differences as regards requirements, the response to disturbances and, interestingly, population management. Our results provide useful information with which to design scientifically-based species adaptive management in response to relevant and timely situations in Europe, such as the potential transmission of shared infections, vehicle collisions, and damage to crops and ecosystems.

AB  - Living on islands entails numerous challenges for animals, among which population density approaching the carrying capacity of trophic resources stands out. To overcome this limitation, many insular lizards can supplement their insectivorous diet with increasing portions of plant material. The Madeira wall lizard, Teira dugesii, is a medium-sized lacertid, endemic to the Madeira and Selvagens archipelagos. As common in this family, adults are sexually dimorphic with males being bigger than females. Previous dietary studies on morphological scatology identified a higher proportion of plant over animal prey items, changing according to the location and sex. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding to examine the diet of this lizard species quantifying it at a higher taxonomical resolution and enhancing the detection of soft-body prey that often go undetected in morphology-based studies. In a sample of 151 faecal samples from eight populations including different habitats and altitudes in Madeira, we identified 289 prey items belonging to eight animal and three plant Classes, encompassing 58 distinct orders and 140 families. Of these, 63 were identified up to the species level. The results support a strong trend towards herbivory in this species with plants representing almost 74% of the diet occurrences in contrast to the 26% of animal prey. Remarkably, the plant fraction of the diet remained stable across localities but varied with size and mass in males. As males grew bigger and heavier, they significantly increased their plant matter intake. Likely, larger bodies and abdomens allowed allocating longer and more complex digestive tracts harbouring intestinal flora to better decompose plant organic compounds. This allowed heavier animals to have a richer diet regime. However, diet richness and composition were not affected by either sex or size, while the locality had a significant effect on both diet components likely in response to local variation in prey availability. By including an increasing plant fraction into a primarily insectivorous diet, this insular lizard has not only enlarged its trophic niche but is also able to exploit more efficiently the highly variable resources provided by insular environments.

AB  - Background: In recent years there has been an increased focus on the role of large herbivores in ecosystem restoration and climate change mitigation. There are multiple processes by which large herbivores could potentially influence climate feedback and forcing effects, but the evidence has not yet been synthesised in a systematic and accessible format. Grazing, browsing, trampling, defecation, and seed dispersal by large herbivores can influence vegetation and soils in ways that may directly or indirectly contribute to climate change or mitigation. For example, changes in vegetation could impact wildfire regimes, carbon storage, and albedo, with ultimate impacts on climate. These processes may be influenced by herbivore species composition, density, and functional traits.
   The main aim of this systematic map is to synthesise the range of research on climate feedback and forcing effects from large herbivores (>= 10 kg) in terrestrial ecosystems. We also aim to identify knowledge clusters and gaps in the research base, as well as assessing the potential for quantitative analyses.
   Methods: A search of peer-reviewed and grey literature will be conducted using a range of bibliographic databases, search engines and websites. The search strategy will involve using a pre-defined search string with Boolean operators. All search results will be screened for relevance according to specific eligibility criteria. Screening will be conducted in two stages: all articles will initially be screened by title and abstract, then those that meet the eligibility criteria will be screened by full text. At both stages, articles will be excluded if they don't meet all eligibility criteria or if they meet any exclusion criteria.
   All articles included as eligible after full text screening will be coded. At each stage (of screening and coding) a proportion of articles will be processed independently by two reviewers to assess inter-reviewer reliability and resolve differences. The evidence will be presented in a searchable database with accompanying visual outputs. A narrative synthesis will be provided outlining the range and distribution of evidence, knowledge gaps and clusters, potential bias, and areas for further research.

AB  - Climate change is modifying the biogeography of many marine species. Squid (Cephalopoda) are important species of the Antarctic pelagic ecosystem, one of the areas most affected by climate change at the global level. The scarce knowledge on potential species distribution shifts in the Southern Ocean and the importance of squids in its pelagic ecosystem highlight the need to characterize how climate change may affect the distribution of these cephalopods in the future. Here, we project future trends for the distribution of 15 squid species from the Southern Ocean, using species distribution models (for the years 2050 and 2100) across 2 scenarios based on the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5). A decline in habitat suitability at lower latitudes was observed for most squids, with no concurrent habitat increase at higher latitudes, mainly due to increases in temperature and sea ice retreat. Nevertheless, while Antarctic and subantarctic squid are projected to experience decreases in habitat suitability, subtropical and cosmopolitan squid may experience increases. The squids Histioteuthis atlantica, Teuthowenia pellucida, Todarodes filippovae and Bathyteuthis abyssicola are candidate winners, while Onykia ingens, O. robsoni, Martialia hyadesi, Gonatus antarcticus, H. eltaninae, Slosarczykovia circumantarctica, Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni, Alluroteuthis antarcticus, Galiteuthis glacialis, Psychroteuthis glacialis and (specially) Moroteuthopsis longimana could lose to climate change. These changes may entail substantial implications for the trophic ecology of the Southern Ocean. Furthermore, squid movement into new ecosystems may increase top-down pressure over lower trophic levels, adding to the abiotic pressures implicit in climate change.

AB  - Livestock farming, which produces milk and meat, is practised by nearly all cultures. But in addition to this, grazing livestock fulfils other fundamentally important roles, one of which is the maintenance of open landscapes, which in turn provides habitat for many rare plant and animal species. Whether wild large herbivores, such as red deer (Cervus elaphus), benefit from the management of the open landscapes is unknown, and there are conflicting views on the nature of the interaction between livestock and wildlife. To investigate this question, we studied interactions in space and time between red deer and livestock in an 787 ha fenced pasture in eastern Germany. First, we used faecal pellet counts to determine whether red deer were using the fenced pasture and whether livestock were using the entire available pasture. Second, we fitted ten red deer, as well as eight Konik horses (Equus ferus caballus) and eight Heck cattle (Bos taurus) with GPS-collars. These data allowed us to perform analyses of space-time interactions. The faecal pellet data showed that red deer did indeed use the fenced pasture and that livestock used the entire extent of the pasture. Further, we verified a neutral space-time interaction between red deer and livestock within the pasture. Thus, there was no indication of a negative effect of the presence of livestock on red deer inside the pasture. For these reasons, we recommend that low-intensity grazing by cattle and horses can maintain open landscapes without detrimental effects on the use of the area by red deer.

AB  - A central challenge in ecology and evolutionary biology is to understand how variation in abiotic and biotic factors combine to shape the distribution, abundance, and diversity of focal species. Environmental gradients, whether natural (e.g., latitude, elevation, ocean proximity) or anthropogenic (e.g., land-use intensity, urbanization), provide compelling settings for addressing this challenge. However, not all organisms are amenable to the observational and experimental approaches required for untangling the factors that structure species along gradients. Here we highlight herbaceous plants in the genus Plantago as models for studying the ecology and evolution of species interactions along abiotic gradients. Plantago lanceolata and P. major are native to Europe and Asia but distributed globally, and they are established models for studying population ecology and interactions with herbivores, pathogens, and soil microbes. Studying restricted range congeners in comparison with those cosmopolitan species can provide insight into abiotic and biotic determinants of range size and population structure. We highlight one such species, P. rugelii, which is endemic to eastern North America. We give an overview of the literature on these focal Plantago species and explain why they are logical candidates for studies of species interactions across environmental gradients. Finally, we emphasize collaborative and community science approaches that can facilitate such research and note the amenability of Plantago for authentic research projects in science education.

AB  - While benthic characteristics of coral reef habitats are a major driver of the structure of coral reef fish assemblages, non-reef habitats adjacent to coral reefs (e.g., mangroves, seagrass beds, and macroalgal beds) can affect reef fish assemblages. Here, we investigate how reef fish assemblages respond to local-scale benthic habitats within a coral reef and larger-scale adjacent seascape features (habitats within 500 m of coral reefs) on Siquijor Island in the Philippines. We examined an abundance of species for the entire reef fish assemblage and within the assemblages of parrotfishes (subfamily Scarinae) and wrasses (family Labridae). Five distinct habitat types were identified in a cluster analysis, which incorporated benthic characteristics within coral reefs and habitats adjacent to coral reefs. We found that the diversity and structure of coral reef fish assemblages were affected by benthic characteristics within coral reefs and also by benthic habitat types adjacent to coral reefs. Individual species responses and juveniles of certain species demonstrated uniquely high abundances in habitat clusters characterized by the non-reef habitats surrounding coral reefs. Considering coral reef habitats and adjacent non-reef habitats as a holistic, interconnected seascape will provide better estimations of the drivers of the structures of coral reef fish assemblages.

AB  - Crop expansion is generally followed by an increase of herbivores. Some of these herbivore species can be favoured by mutualisms with ants that can also colonise introduced crops. Here, we hypothesized that the invasive mealybug Pseudococcus longispinus has established mutualistic relationships with native or exotic ants in Mediterranean persimmon crop. This relationship could negatively impact mealybug natural enemies and facilitate the colonisation of this new crop by the mealybug. To test this hypothesis, we sampled 17 persimmon orchards from the main producing area of the Mediterranean basin across two consecutive years and three different seasons. We identified the ant complex attending Ps. longispinus, calculated the ant attendance ratios and assessed the density dependence between tending ants and Ps. longispinus at mealybug colony level. Finally, we evaluated the effect of ants on the density of Ps. longispinus and its natural enemies at tree level. Fifteen ant species were found foraging in persimmon trees, out of which 11 attended Ps. longispinus colonies. The Mediterranean native species Lasius grandis, Pheidole pallidula and Plagiolepis spp. were the most abundant ant species in the canopies, and La. grandis was the most abundant species attending Ps. longispinus. This ant tended to attend large colonies of the mealybug in spring and summer. Pseudococcus longispinus density was positively correlated with ant activity in persimmon trees, which can be partially explained by the negative effect of ants on the mealybug parasitism and the density of potential predators. This study suggests that the density and damage caused by Ps. longispinus in Mediterranean persimmon are exacerbated by the attendance of native ants that disrupt mealybug biological control. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that ant attendance is a driving factor determining the density of honeydew-producing herbivores and highlight that native ant species may facilitate the establishment and spread of exotic honeydew-producing pests in new crops.

AB  - Simple Summary The mangrove ecosystem is an important resource for the survival of thousands of species of animals and plants. It has high ecological and economic value and has made great contributions to the protection and maintenance of marine and terrestrial ecological environment. However, due to climatic and human factors, the mangrove ecosystem has been destroyed and its ecological functions have been damaged. As an important indicator species, fishes have also been affected, with changes in their population and nutritional structure. This study summarized the mangrove fish in China and compiled a relatively complete list of mangrove fish. In addition, the biogeographic characteristics of Chinese mangrove fish were analyzed, filling the gap of national mangrove fish distribution data. Completion of this study contributed to a better understanding of the role of mangroves in maintaining the stability and diversity of fish communities, which was of great value for the management and conservation of regional and global biodiversity. Mangroves are among the most productive marine and coastal ecosystems and play an important role in maintaining the stability and diversity of fish communities. To explore the structure of mangrove fish communities in China, we compiled previous studies, monographs, and two databases on 54 mangrove areas published in the past 30 years. Mangrove fish communities in China comprised Osteichthys (597 species) and Chondrichthyes (14 species), representing 611 species in 344 genera, 117 families, and 28 orders. Perciformes were the predominant taxon, with 350 species in 52 families, accounting for 57% of the total species richness. Reef fish accounted for 29.62%. With regard to feeding groups, there were 328 carnivorous species (53.68%), 214 omnivorous species (35.02%), 41 herbivorous species (6.71%), and 28 detritivores species (4.58%). Classified by body size, 57.61% were small-sized, 24.22% medium-sized, and 18.17% were large-sized fishes. A total of 5.23% (32 species) of these mangrove fish are currently on IUCN red lists, i.e., 2 species are critically endangered, 4 are endangered, 12 are vulnerable, and 14 are near threatened. Cluster analyses shows that Chinese mangroves fish were divided into two categories, i.e., coastal mangrove and island mangrove type. This is closely related to the distribution of reef fish. Moreover, the number of fish species showed a strong positive correlation with mangrove area, but not with latitude. The main reasons may be the subtropical and tropical geographic locations, as well as the characteristics of the South China Sea and the Taiwan Warm Current. The size and integrity of mangrove area are crucial to the local ecosystems; thus, protecting and restoring mangroves is of great significance to large-scale ecosystem-stability and local biodiversity.

AB  - Background The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus L. 1758) was introduced into different regions of the world, generating significant trade-offs that critically impacted native vegetation. Here, we evaluate the rabbit's forage intakes in three vegetation types (forests, shrublands, and grasslands) along the four seasons in a temperate forest landscape in Southern Patagonia and discuss the potential threats over native vegetation. We formulated the following questions: (i) what is the forage offer at each vegetation type? (ii) what is the rabbit's forage intake and how it varied across the seasons along the year? and (iii) which vegetation types and plant life forms were more used according to the rabbit's forage intakes? Methods We censused understory vegetation to characterize the forage offer at each vegetation type and determined seasonal dietary intakes using microhistological analysis of pellets. The plant species identified in the field were grouped according to life form classes (tree regeneration, shrubs, forbs, graminoids, orchids, ferns, bryophytes, and hemiparasites). Data were analysed through uni- and multi-variate analyses, determining relationships between forage offer and the rabbit's forage intakes. Results Forage intakes revealed changes in plant life form consumption across vegetation types, where intake pressure was considerably different for tree regeneration (p = 0.001), graminoids (p = 0.001), and hemiparasites (p = 0.001). Besides, significant changes in consumption among seasons were detected for shrubs (p = 0.001), ferns (p = 0.030), and hemiparasites (p = 0.002). Although many species play an important role in the rabbit's forage intake networks (e.g., Chiliotrichum diffusum, Holcus lanatus), the strongest intake linkages were found in exotic grasses (e.g., Poa pratensis and Festuca sp.), native hemiparasites (e.g., Misodendrum sp.), native shrubs (e.g., Empetrum rubrum), and native trees (e.g., Nothofagus sp.). The summer and autumn seasons presented higher intake compared to the winter and spring seasons. Furthermore, hemiparasites intake (e.g., Misodendrum sp.) suggests that rabbits utilize different forage sources depending on the vegetation types. Conclusions Rabbits regularly inhabit the forest, even though it is not their preferred vegetation type to live. Rabbit management entails isolating regions that are more favourable to intake and emphasizing the year's season for rabbit control efforts.

AB  - In recent years, the habitat distribution of wild boar has expanded in Japan, and the damage caused by wild boar has been significantly increased. In Bingo Sports Park, a regional park, wild boar damage has also been increasingly severe. To take effective measures, it is necessary to understand where wild boars enter the park, how they move through it, and where the damage is caused. Therefore, this study examines both environmental characteristics inside and outside the park and behavioral characteristics of wild boar using drones, sensor technology and GIS, and then clarifies the main factors contributing to wild boar damage based the logistic regression analysis. In addition, countermeasures such as installing electric fences and repellents were taken, and their effectiveness was verified. There were three main findings. First, the behavioral pattern of wild boars was found to be likely to enter from valleys and usually move on roads in the park. Second, the probability of occurring wild boar damage is higher in areas closer to roads and valleys with more natural cover. Third, the countermeasures have a significant effect on reducing wild boar damage since the amount of damage in the Multi-purposed square installed countermeasure was too small.

AB  - Drone platforms are increasingly used for aerial wildlife surveys, but the validity of population counts has not been fully evaluated in all environments. Aerial surveys generally undercount the true population size and one must estimate detection probability (p) to correct for missed individuals. Detection probability for visual observers is influenced by vegetation and terrain characteristics, but the use of thermal cameras as the observer may also introduce additional factors influencing detection probability. We conducted diurnal, thermal-based drone surveys for ungulates during February-April 2020 in South Texas, USA, on sites with varying degrees of woody cover and terrain. We examined histograms of georeferenced perpendicular distances to determine the effect of habitat on detection probabilities. We also examined precision in population estimates and variation in repeated surveys. Finally, we compared drone population estimates to independent estimates derived from helicopter, spotlight, and trail-camera surveys. Distributions of perpendicular distances from the transect were affected by habitat characteristics. A flat grassland site had relatively few detections near the transect because thermal (solar) reflectance in the center of the footage obscured detections. A hilly brushy site had a uniform p (1.00) but resulted in a severe undercount due to the inability of the drone to follow contours of hills. The flat brushy site had a lower p (0.63), indicating visibility bias. Two additional flat, brushy sites were surveyed repeatedly (n = 5 and 9 surveys, respectively). All combinations of up to 3 repeated surveys were pooled to meet the recommended minimum number of detections for distance sampling analyses (>= 60 detections). Population estimates had acceptable precision (CV <= 20%) 80.7% of the time and variation among repeated surveys was acceptable (CV = 9% and 23%, respectively). Drone-based population estimates were comparable with estimates generated from corrected helicopter, spotlight, and trail-camera surveys. Overall, diurnal drone surveys can generate population estimates for large ungulates on southwestern rangelands after accounting for visibility bias, but may be limited by terrain and thermal conditions.
   Drones equipped with thermal cameras are being used to survey wildlife, but reliability of population estimates are untested. Repeated drone surveys of white-tailed deer yielded repeatable and precise estimates that were comparable with other estimators. Future work is needed to evaluate the role of habitat characteristics influencing detectability of wildlife. image

AB  - Large-bodied wild ungulates are declining worldwide, while domestic livestock continue to increase in abundance. Such changes in large herbivore communities should have strong effects on the control of ticks and tick-borne disease as they can indirectly modify habitat and directly serve as final hosts for ticks' lifecycles. Numerous studies have now linked changing ungulate communities to changes in tick populations and disease risk. However, the effects of changing large herbivore communities are variable across studies, and the effect of climate as a mediating factor of this variation remains poorly understood. Also, studies to date have largely focused on wildlife loss without considering the extent to which livestock additions may alter tick populations, even though livestock replacement of wildlife is the global norm. In this study, we used a large-scale exclosure experiment replicated along a topo-climatic gradient to examine the effects on tick populations of both large herbivore removal and livestock additions. We found that while questing ticks increased modestly, by 21%, when large herbivores were removed from a system they decreased more substantially, by 50%, when livestock (in the form of cattle) were added. Importantly, in addition to the direct effects of climate on tick populations, climate also mediates the effect of ungulates on questing tick density. Particularly, the addition of livestock under the most arid conditions decreased tick presence, likely due to changes in ground-level microclimates away from those beneficial to ticks. Overall, the work contributes to our understanding of tick population responses to globally common human-induced rangeland alterations under the concurrent effects of climate change.

AB  - Soil microbial mutualists like rhizobia bacteria can promote the establishment of rare, late-successional legumes. Despite restoration efforts, these mutualists are often absent in the microbiome. Therefore, restoring this mutualism by directly inoculating rare legumes with rhizobia mutualists may increase plant establishment. We inoculated seedlings of Amorpha canescens, Dalea purpurea, and Lespedeza capitata with three strains of species-specific rhizobia each to investigate how this mutualism would promote growth in the field and in the greenhouse. Because many herbaceous plants are vulnerable to herbivory, we used exclosures for half of our field transplantations to prevent mammalian herbivory. We did not find that rhizobia bacteria directly promoted the growth of our legumes in the field but rather that herbivory and environmental conditions overwhelmed the effects of the rhizobia. Of the plants transplanted, only 17.78% of 180 survived to the end of the growing season, all of which were protected from herbivory. Survival at the end of the growing season was also greater in the northern, drier end of the field site. In the second growing season, plants were more likely to survive in the exclosure treatment, while only four recovered in the open treatment. In the greenhouse, we found increased nodulation with inoculations, supporting the hypothesis that species-specific mutualists are absent from restoration sites. Though several recent studies have shown that restoring mutualistic interactions has the potential to dramatically improve the outcomes of ecological restoration, our results show that protecting rare species from herbivory after transplantation might achieve greater gains in establishment.

AB  - Lepidoptera biodiversity on Isla Socorro. a small volcanic island in the Islas Revillagigedo Archipelago located off the west coast of Mexico, is poorly known. The native flora of this island was severely degraded for more than 140 years of overgrazing by introduced feral sheep. Sheep were successfully eradicated in 2012, and the habitat is now beginning to recover. The few published records of the butterfly fauna (eight species), however, were obtained more than 30 years ago, well before sheep removal. Here we provide results of a recent survey of the Lepidoptera based on collecting and observation of adult butterflies during November, 2019. We confirmed that five of the eight previously recorded species are still present, and in addition show that Pyrisitia lisa centralis (Pieridae) has now become established. We also analyzed DNA barcodes from the endemic hairstreak Strytnon istapa socorroica (Lycaenidae) that support maintaining its subspecies status. Whether the three previously recorded species not seen by us have been extirpated will require more exhaustive sampling.

AB  - Woody plant encroachment into rangeland ecosystems is a widespread and often unwelcomed circumstance affecting rangeland management decisions worldwide. In the rangeland management profession, varying philosophies have been employed in the management of woody plant encroachment. Following World War II, total eradication of woody plant cover was commonly practiced, eventually giving way to a mosaic approach that benefits livestock, wildlife, and recreational objectives, with cover increasing or even stabilizing in many areas. Cultural practices such as land fragmentation, lifestyles not dependent on agricultural income, and shifts in herbivory from predominately browsers to grazers may also be contributing factors. Modern image analysis technologies, such as object-oriented feature extraction and patch metric analyses, can shed light on past paradigm shifts through spectral and textural assessment of modern and historical aerial photography. In this study, woody plant cover and patch metrics were analyzed for a period spanning from 1938 to 1940 through 2018 in the Bennett and Sulphur Creek watersheds of the Lampasas Cut Plain of Central Texas. Object-based feature extraction was used to calculate woody plant cover, and Fragstats was used for landscape patch metrics. Total woody cover was compared with past stewardship paradigms. There was a net decrease of total woody plant cover from 1938 to 1940 through 2018, with variation in between as management paradigms shifted. A pattern of decline, regrowth, and stabilization, like that observed in other research, was noticed for the Bennett Creek watersheds but was not apparent in Sulfur Creek. Patch size/shape varied as well, but fractal patch complexity was relatively stable through time. Raster algebra analysis showed that < 10% of the initial woody cover from 1938 to 1940 remained in 2018, although total cover went through various expansion/reduction phases.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a toxicant of concern, particularly in aquatic food webs. Mercury can move to terrestrial systems through consumption of aquatic prey or emergence of insects with aquatic larval phases. The possible movement of Hg from sediments to wetland plants and into terrestrial food webs though primary consumers has received less attention. We investigated differences and correlations in Hg in soil, wood and leaves of willows (Salix caroliniana) and folivorous beetles from a wetland with enhanced levels of Hg. Further, we compared samples from tree islands that had enriched Hg in soil through bird guano with control islands. Hg in any sample type did not correlate with Hg in any other sample type from the same island. We found higher [Hg] in soils and significantly higher [Hg] in leaves from colony islands, while [Hg] in beetles appeared to be higher in control islands. In any case, despite comparatively high [Hg] in soil and leaves, Hg in folivorous beetles was below detection levels and lower than that reported from other studies. We conclude that movement of Hg from wetland trees to terrestrial food webs through wetland vegetation is negligible in this ecosystem.

AB  - Mangrove forests are increasingly threatened by plant invasions worldwide, but some mangrove species are invasive and threaten salt marsh and native mangrove ecosystems. The southern coast of China is invaded by the cordgrass Spartina alterniflora, and the mangrove Sonneratia apetala, providing a model system for studying the processes and mechanisms through which non-native species establish and spread. We used a transplant experiment to test the overarching hypothesis that native herbivores and plants provided biotic resistance against invasion by S. apetala, and that the importance of these factors would vary geographically. Survival of transplanted mangrove seedlings was lower in Zhangjiang Estuary (23 degrees 55 ' N) than in Leizhou Bay (20 degrees 56 ' N), and varied with species and habitats. S. apetala had higher survival and growth rates than native mangroves at both sites, and S. apetala grew taller than the S. alterniflora canopy at Leizhou Bay in only two growing seasons. In contrast, native mangroves grew poorly in S. alterniflora. Grazing by rodents and insects suppressed the growth and survival of Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina in Zhangjiang Estuary and Leizhou Bay, but had little effect on S. apetala. Competition with vegetation (S. alterniflora and native mangroves) exacerbated the reduced survival of native mangroves, and these effects varied across study sites. Low survival of non-native S. apetala in vegetated habitats at Zhangjiang Estuary was likely due to a synergistic effect of low winter temperatures and low light intensity. Escape from herbivory (the opposite to biotic resistance) and fast growth may drive the quick expansion of non-native S. apetala in China. Rapid encroachment of S. apetala may transform the native mangrove forests and monospecific intertidal Spartina grasslands into non-native mangrove forests in the southern coast of China.

AB  - Species reintroductions have the potential to cause genetic bottleneck events resulting in increased genetic drift, increased inbreeding, and reduced genetic diversity creating negative fitness consequences for populations. Roosevelt elk (Cervus canadensis roosevelti Erxleben, 1777) are "at risk" in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Once widespread along the west coast, Roosevelt elk were likely extirpated from the mainland by 1900 and experienced a substantial population bottleneck on Vancouver Island at that time, and again in the 1950s. Reintroduced to the mainland from Vancouver Island in the 1980s, this re-established population became the source for subsequent mainland translocations. To understand the effects of reintroduction strategy on genetic diversity, we analyzed genetic variation in 355 Roosevelt elk from Vancouver Island and mainland BC. Using mitochondrial DNA and 10 microsatellite loci, molecular analyses showed overall reduced genetic diversity relative to other extant elk populations, genetic isolation of the southern Vancouver Island population, and increased genetic drift among reintroduced herds. Four reintroduced populations were found to have increased levels of inbreeding. Results of this study contribute to our knowledge of reintroduction biology and can be used to guide continued conservation and management of at-risk species.

AB  - These days, high-density cities are facing growing challenges related to the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Greening can be a nature-based solution for UHI effect mitigation. This study aims to evaluate the potential of nature-based solutions to improve the urban living environments in Baishizhou, a high-density neighbourhood in Shenzhen. An integrated 3D visualisation research method was proposed in this study. Rhino 7, Grasshopper, and ENVI-met software were combined to evaluate environment characteristics before and after design, as well as compare differences in the outdoor thermal comfort index and the building surface temperature. The greening design scenarios include adding trees, green roofs, and green facades. The simulations ran for 24 h during the test period from 01:00 to 24:00 on 9 August 2019, which was the hottest day in Shenzhen. Baishizhou was selected as the test area for this study and environmental simulation. Results indicated that (1) vegetation has a positive cooling effect, providing outdoor thermal comfort, while shade "trees" provide significant cooling effects on hot days in tropical and subtropical climates; (2) adding green roofs and green facades to a building can significantly affect the cooling effect.

AB  - On an evolutionary time scale, competition for food drives species formation by genetic adaptations to the environment and subsequent niche separation. On a short-term scale, animals use different strategies to meet their nutritional requirements, which ultimately influence their fitness. Understanding these adaptations in herbivores is especially important in temperate climates where animals have adapted both physiologically and behaviorally to seasonal variations in order to meet their nutritional requirements. The aim of this project was to investigate temporal variation in chemical composition of rumen content between two coexisting species of large herbivores, the native roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.) and the introduced fallow deer (Dama dama L.), as well as a potential effect of competition on niche separation (interspecific differences in rumen nutrient composition). We analyzed 345 rumen samples collected from animals at one 95 km(2) estate, Koberg, in southwestern Sweden. Based on samples from all seasons, temporal variation in nutrient composition and interspecific differences between the two deer species were investigated under two contrasting fallow deer population densities. Results revealed that nutrient composition varied between species and across seasons. Roe deer had a higher proportion of rumen protein compared to fallow deer, with the highest proportions in spring. In contrast, fallow deer had a higher proportion of rumen hemicellulose compared to roe deer in spring, while no differences in nutrient composition between species could be found in fall. Overall, there were greater differences between the two species when fallow deer density was high and competition likely more pronounced than when fallow deer density was low. The results from this study can be used to understand interspecific competition and how it fosters niche separation between coexisting large herbivores.

AB  - The Philippine native pig (PhNP) is a unique genetic resource composed of multiple domesticated Sus scrofa lineages and interspecific hybrids. No prior study has determined the population structure and genetic diversity of PhNPs on multiple islands and provinces, which is essential for establishing conservation priorities. In this study, we explore the population structure and genetic diversity of various PhNP populations in Luzon and the Visayas, Philippines, to identify conservation priorities. We analyzed seven PhNP populations (n = 20-27 samples each; Benguet [B], Kalinga [K], Nueva Vizcaya [N], Isabela [I], Quezon [Q], Marinduque [M], and Samar [S]) and four transboundary breeds present in the Philippines (n = 9-11 samples each; Duroc, Large White, Landrace, and Berkshire). The pigs were compared against a panel of 20 microsatellite markers recommended by the ISAG-FAO. We tested for population structure at the island, region, and province levels. Strong genetic differentiation between native and transboundary breeds was confirmed by Bayesian clustering (k = 2) and Nei's D-A genetic distance (100% bootstrap support for the PhNP cluster). PhNP exhibited high heterozygosity (Ho: 0.737), a high allele count (Na: 7.771), and a low inbreeding coefficient (Fis: -0.040-0.125). Bayesian clustering supported genetic differentiation at the island (k = 2; North Luzon and South Luzon-Visayas cluster), region (k = 3), and population (k = 8) levels. The pairwise F'st between PhNP populations ranged from 0.084 (N and I) to 0.397 (Q and K), confirming that some PhNP populations exhibited sufficient genetic distance to be considered separate populations. This study shows that native pigs from B, K, I, Q, M, and S are unique genetic units for conservation. Furthermore, the small effective population sizes of B, I, Q, M, and S (Ne: 3.9, 19.1, 14.2, 44.7, and 22.5, respectively) necessitate immediate conservation actions, such as incentivizing PhNP farming.

AB  - Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson) forests in the western United States have experienced reduced fire frequency since Euro-American settlement, usually because of successful fire suppression policies and even without such human impacts at remote sites in the Great Basin and Mojave Deserts. In an effort to improve our understanding of long-term environmental dynamics in sky-island ecosystems, we developed tree-ring chronologies from ponderosa pines located in the Sheep Mountain Range of southern Nevada, inside the Desert National Wildlife Refuge (DNWR). After comparing those dendrochronological records with other ones available for the south-central Great Basin, we analyzed their climatic response using station-recorded monthly precipitation and air temperature data from 1950 to 2024. The main climatic signal was December through May total precipitation, which was then reconstructed at annual resolution over the past five centuries, from 1490 to 2011 CE. The mean episode duration was 2.6 years, and the maximum drought duration was 11 years (1924-1934; the "Dust Bowl" period), while the longest episode, 19 years (1905-1923), is known throughout North America as the "early 1900s pluvial". By quantifying multi-annual dry and wet episodes, the period since DNWR establishment was placed in a long-term dendroclimatic framework, allowing us to estimate the potential drought resilience of its unique, tree-dominated environments.

AB  - Biological invasions threaten biodiversity globally. In Australia, introduced and invasive European red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are a major predator of native wildlife, and are implicated in numerous species extinctions, prompting large-scale fox population control programs. Lethal control-typically via poison (1080) baiting-is common, but the consistency of its efficacy has been questioned, and the desired outcomes are frequently not measured or evaluated. We aimed to assess the success and impacts of lethal fox control on fox activity, and subsequent effects on a co-occurring, invasive mesopredator (feral cat, Felis catus), and native and invasive prey species. We surveyed three locations in the Wimmera region of Victoria, each experienced a different baiting regime (no baiting, standard systematic baiting, intensified baiting). Camera traps were deployed from April 2021 to August 2023 to determine predator activity alongside non-target herbivores. Baiting treatment was not associated with differences in fox or cat activity. Nurcoung (no baiting) had the lowest activity of both cats and foxes across the study. Fox activity patterns under standard baiting were higher than intensified baiting. Our results suggest that fox control might destabilise population dynamics of foxes, potentially facilitating increased activity levels through higher emigration rates from the surrounding agricultural environments. Our study highlights the critical importance of appropriately monitoring the outcomes of invasive species control programs to ensure the a priori strategic objectives are achieved. To achieve more effective fox population suppression broader, landscape-scale approaches that take a nil-tenure approach are essential.

AB  - ContextLinear Transportation Infrastructures (LTIs) are among the largest factors responsible for landscape fragmentation, in turn increasing population isolation. In this context, studies have mainly focused on a single species' response to barrier elements and mitigation thereof. Yet, the implementation of conservation strategies to restore landscape connectivity may be challenging when multi-specific responses are not measured and fully considered.ObjectivesWe aimed to assess the effect of two different types of LTIs, a fenced highway and a navigation canal on gene flow in three ungulate species in Northeastern France.MethodsWe genotyped 98 red deer (C. elaphus), 120 wild boars (S. scrofa) and 140 roe deer (C. capreolus) with species-specific microsatellite markers from 3 sampling sites located on either side of both LTIs considered in the study area. We assessed the continuity of gene flow using Bayesian clustering methods and a mapping approach to determine inter-individual genetic dissimilarity in relation to landscape characteristics.ResultsOur study showed different impacts of LTIs on the gene flow of species belonging a priori to the same functional group. Genetic differentiation among red deer and wild boar sampling units was observed on either side of the highway, but no such differentiation was identified for roe deer. However, no genetic structuring was associated with the presence of the canal in any species.ConclusionsThe impact of LTIs on gene flow in large species results from the structural characteristics of the infrastructure, and our study shows that mitigation measures should consider species-specific behaviors to facilitate the use of crossing structures and thus ensure gene flow across ILTs.

AB  - Caprine overbrowsing is a main threat to trees of pastoral mountain woodlands in the Mediterranean region of Europe. In this study, we assess the impact of browsing exclusion on the growth and regeneration of the en-dangered Zelkova abelicea, a Paleogene relict tree endemic to Crete (Greece). Shoot elongation, height growth and natural regeneration were monitored during two to five years in 31 fenced plots across the distribution range of the species. We found that in the absence of browsing pressure, Z. abelicea produces shoots on average two times longer than when browsed, therefore clearly demonstrating the negative impact of current browsing pressure on the growth performance of the species. Shoot elongation and height growth were maximal in most plots during the first two years following fencing, after which growth rates decreased. The proportion of trees that reached a height considered out of reach of caprine browsing had more than doubled already after four years, although this was dependent on initial tree height. Shoot elongation and height growth were positively correlated with tree height, and smaller trees took more time to reach a specific height. Seedlings were only found in three fenced plots as well as in two control browsed areas during a single year and only in western Crete. This underlines the possible strong and concerning impact of climatic factors on seed formation as well as on seedling growth and survival, although site specificities such as stand structure and micro-topography should also be considered. Our findings have important implications for conservation actions, as they can help choose which stands and which individuals to fence in priority for efficient long-term conservation.

AB  - One of the consequences of climate change is an increase in the temperature of the oceans, which is considered to be one of the greatest impacts on biodiversity. Fish may respond to this impact in several ways, including shifts in their patterns of occurrence. The present study investigated the variation in the structure of a H. reidi population between 2015 and 2017 in the northern Guaiba Island area, highlighting a possible relationship to thermal anomaly associated with the El Nino phenomenon. The seahorse population monitoring was performed monthly, recording sex ratio, abundance, juvenile and adult proportion, depth of occurrence, total length and the holdfast which the seahorse were found attached. The influence of the El Nino event on the study population was evaluated by the correlation of the thermal anomaly data reported for the Tropical South Atlantic Index. Seahorse density on northern Guaiba island was positively and significantly correlated with water temperature, but the sex ratio and number of juveniles were not. The diversity of holdfasts used increased over the study period and was inversely proportional to the thermal anomaly. These results suggest that the thermal anomalies caused by the El Nino in the South Atlantic might trigger migration behaviour in the study species, providing a large aggregation during that period in Guaiba island.

AB  - Carnivores, especially wolves (Canis sp.), have profound impacts on their ecosystems, affecting the abundance and behavior of prey and competitors, but this has not been examined in detail for red wolves (C. rufus). We studied a population of red wolves that was reintroduced to eastern North Carolina in 1987 and initially thrived, peaking at 120 animals. Due to an increase in anthropogenic mortality and a decline in government support, the population experienced a crash starting in 2014. We evaluated changes in the relative abundance of prey and competitor species during the red wolf decline with 25 camera traps run primarily on National Wildlife Refuges from 2015 to 2021. If red wolves were having an ecological effect on the mammal community, we expected this effect would decline as the wolf population waned, resulting in increased prey and competitor populations. Supporting this, we found that relative abundance increased for most prey and competitor species including American black bear (Ursus americanus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) and Northern raccoon (Procyon lotor). For all species, this increase was most notable after spring 2018, the second year with low red wolf reproduction. For some species, the increase was dramatic; the detection rate for raccoon, bear and bobcat doubled from the spring of 2018 to the spring of 2021. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) showed a general increase in relative abundance but remained prevalent even at their lowest detection rates. Our results lend correlational support to the hypothesis that red wolves had a strong effect on their ecosystems by suppressing prey and competitor populations when they were at their peak. This study adds to the growing body of evidence that reintroductions of large predators have ecological impacts, with the caveat that these impacts can decline rapidly if the predators dwindle back to critically low numbers.

AB  - Reintroduction of European bison into the natural environment is one of the most important conservation measures applied for this species. After creating a free herd of European bison, spatial monitoring is crucial. It allows for observation of the population, as well as the detection of potential threats and needs for intervention. In 2016, a new free herd of European bison was introduced to the Zednia District in Knyszynska Forest. After a few months spent in the acclimation enclosure, the animals were released. The course of their acclimatisation was observed with GPS collars during the next 7 years. Thanks to telemetry monitoring, we could determine the moment when the herd stabilised its home range within available habitats. Monitoring performed for 7 years after the release of the herd confirmed the previously established home range. The fact that the animals remain close to the release site and that there is no damage to the winter crops confirms that the reintroduction site was well chosen.

AB  - 1. Contemporary ecosystems commonly support multiple non-native species, which can alter community structure and directly or indirectly interact with one another. Novel interactions between invasive species can result in the facilitation or suppression of one or both invaders, making it important to understand the underlying mechanisms that affect invasion outcomes.2. Goldfish Carassius auratus and Chinese mystery snails Cipangopaludina chinensis have been introduced widely through the aquarium trade and co-occur in their non-native ranges. We used an outdoor mesocosm experiment to assess separate and combined effects of goldfish and mystery snails on urban pond community structure and to investigate whether goldfish and mystery snails affected one another positively, neutrally or negatively. We predicted that the distinct trophic levels of each species and the anti-predator traits of mystery snails would lead to positive interactions between invaders and synergistic effects on the aquatic community.3. Goldfish directly increased turbidity and decreased filamentous algae, zooplankton, juvenile native snails and survival of amphibians via consumptive effects. Goldfish indirectly increased periphyton, phytoplankton and body size of surviving native green frogs Lithobates clamitans through trophic cascades and/or release from competition. Mystery snails had more subtle effects including reducing growth rates of native grey tree frogs Hyla versicolor, likely through competitive interactions.4. With goldfish present, mystery snails showed increased reproductive success (higher biomass of juveniles), likely due to indirect competitive release from other herbivores. In contrast to their effects on native snails, goldfish did not consume juvenile mystery snails, likely due to their unique traits (e.g. large size and shell thickness). Mystery snails slightly reduced goldfish growth but did not affect their survival.5. These results suggest unidirectional facilitation between invaders via indirect changes in the food web. Overall, our study found strong direct and indirect effects of invasive aquarium species, particularly goldfish, and provides experimental support for the invasional meltdown hypothesis within urban waterbodies, which are especially prone to invasions.

AB  - The biology of the weed goat's-rue, Galega officinalis (Fabaceae), is reviewed. Introduced to Canada in the late 19th Century as an ornamental, it has become established at scattered localities and is spreading locally in southern Ontario. The plant is considered a noxious weed and is legally regulated in many jurisdictions due to the production of toxic alkaloids and its invasive characteristics. Primarily a weed of pastures, grasslands and perennial crops, it also displaces native vegetation in areas where it becomes established. Originally endemic in the Black Sea region, it was spread by humans through Europe and eastward to Pakistan as a herbal medicine. More recently it has been introduced widely as a forage and ornamental plant. As a folk remedy it has been used primarily to treat diabetes in humans and to enhance milk production in both humans and livestock. The plant has also been used as a forage by limiting consumption to early growth stages and the quantity ingested. Effective control has been achieved with 2,4-D, dicamba, tryclopyr, metsulfuron methyl and other herbicides. Goat's-rue forms a highly specific nitrogen-fixin g symbiosis with the soil bacterium Neorhizobium galegae symbiovar officinalis. Successful establishment of Goat's rue in new regions depends on the co-introduction of plant and bac-terium. The lack of long-distance dispersal adaptations, soil pH requirements and its symbiont dependency, reduces the ability of G. officinalis to spread into novel areas without anthropogenic activities. These constraints to establishment may facilitate management and eradication strategies.

AB  - Data extraction from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery has proved effective in animal surveys and monitoring, but to date has scarcely been used for detailed population analysis and individual animal feature extraction. We assessed the zoometric and feature extraction of the Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx) using data acquired from a captive population for comparison with reintroduced populations monitored by UAVs. Highly accurate scaled and geo-rectified imagery derived from UAV surveys allowed precise morphometric measurements of the oryx. The scaled top-view imagery combined with baseline data from known sex, age, weight and pregnancy status of captive individuals were used to develop predictive models. A bracketed index developed from the predictive models showed high accuracy for classifying the age group <= 16 months, animals with a weight >80 kg and pregnancy. The pregnancy classification decision tree model performed with 91.7% accuracy. The polynomial weight predictive model performed well with relatively high accuracy when using the total top-view surface measurement. Photogrammetrically processed UAV-acquired imagery can yield valuable zoometric data, feature extraction and modelling; it is a tool with a practical application for field biologists that can assist in the decision-making process for species conservation management.

AB  - Land-use and local field management affect pollinators, pest damage and ultimately crop yields. Agroecology is implemented as a sustainable alternative to conventional agricultural practices, but little is known about its potential for pollination and pest management. Sub-Saharan Africa is underrepresented in studies investigating the relative importance of pests and pollinators for crop productivity and how this might be influenced by surrounding landscapes or agroecological practices. In Malawi, we selected 24 smallholder farms differing in landscape-scale shrubland cover, implementation of manual pest removal as an indicator of an agroecological pest management practice, and the number of agroecological soil practices employed at the household level, such as mulching, intercropping and soil conservation tillage. We established pumpkin plots and assessed the abundance and richness of flower visitors and damage of flowers (florivory) caused by pest herbivores on flowers. Using a full-factorial hand pollination and exclusion experiment on each plot, we investigated the relative contribution of pollination and florivory to pumpkin yield. Increasing shrubland cover decreased honeybee abundance but increased the abundance and richness of non-honeybee visitors. Manual removal of herbivores considered to be pests reduced flower visitors, whereas more agroecological soil management practices increased flower visitors. Neither shrubland cover nor agroecological management affected florivory. Pollinator limitation, but not florivory, constrained pumpkin fruit set, and increasing visitor richness decreased the relative differences between hand-and animal-pollinated flowers. We recommend improved protection of shrubland habitats and increasing agroecological soil practices to promote pollinator richness on smallholder farms.

AB  - Background The chilla or grey fox (Lycalopex griseus) is a native species from continental Chile and neighboring areas of Argentina. It was introduced to Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego in 1951 and began to increase its abundance, to the chagrin of local sheep ranchers. Since 1998, its hunting has been authorized. Here we update information on the density, abundance, and activity of this fox in the Chilean sector of Tierra del Fuego Island, to evaluate its population trend since the last census conducted by the Servicio Agricola y Ganadero (SAG) in 2007. Methods and results We carried out two fox censuses on a 941-km transect on public roads, divided into eight routes, from October to November (spring) of 2021 and 2022, following the same design used by SAG for the fox assessments carried out from 1999 to 2007. We report a reduction of > 50% in the density and abundance of chilla foxes with respect to the 2007 estimate, which could be attributed to the interference by free-ranging dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), through restricting the use of space by the fox, while transmitting diseases and parasites, and to human hunting pressure and vehicle collisions. Discussion The chilla fox decline highlights the need for an in-depth study to determine the ecological and socioeconomic impact of this exotic species on the ecosystems of Tierra del Fuego Island and the desirability of its management, if needed.

AB  - Two opposite spatial dynamics of red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) occur in Mediterranean landscapes at the end of the summer: a higher segregation of animals during periods of food scarcity versus the aggregation of individuals of both sexes for reproductive purposes. Nevertheless, red deer spatial dynamics and activity patterns may differ in fenced areas, where high deer numbers are reached artificially through intensive management. Yet, such effects remain insufficiently investigated in the literature, despite the prevalence of fenced estates in Mediterranean landscapes within central-southern Iberian Peninsula. We used camera traps and Random Forest to analyze how environmental and anthropogenic factors affected red deer spatial dynamics in a perimeter-fenced Mediterranean landscape during the period of the year when food resources are most limited. Our key findings indicated that females selected areas with higher-quality food resources, and elevated nutritional needs due to lactation, corresponding to the flat, humid lowland areas. In contrast, males demonstrated a less concentrated distribution, although during the rut they migrated towards territories with females. Conversely, daily activity patterns did not differ significantly between sexes. The Random Forest model revealed how altitude, slope, and proximity to water sources or supplementary crops influenced deer spatial dynamics. Our findings emphasized the importance of assessing seasonal movement patterns of deer within fenced areas to determine whether their behavior aligns with natural conditions and if the enclosed landscape ensures adequate environmental heterogeneity. When these requirements are met, fenced landscapes can contribute to the health of deer populations and ecosystems. Therefore, such assessments (i.e., camera trap monitoring and spatial modeling of seasonal movement patterns) can subsequently be used as an additional indicator of good deer management practices, complementing those already in use.

AB  - Numerous unique flora and fauna inhabit the Lower Florida Keys, including the endangered Florida Key deer, found nowhere else. In this vulnerable habitat of flat islands with low elevation, accelerated sea level rise poses a threat. Predicting the impact of sea level rise on vegetation and wildlife is crucial. This study used 5 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sea level rise scenarios to assess their effects on No Name Key, Florida. The goal was to estimate changes in the Florida Key deer population relative to sea level rise using a lidar-derived elevation data and a vegetation map. The method used 2 cases to model the sea level rise impact. In Case 1, total non-submerged area at current sea level was determined. Using 5 IPCC scenarios, a new total nonsubmerged land area was estimated, and deer numbers were predicted for each scenario. In Case 2, upward migration of coastal vegetation combined with the coastal squeeze process was modeled. A distinct elevation range for each vegetation type at the current sea level was determined. Vegetation ranges were redistributed based on respective elevation ranges in the sea level rise scenarios. Areas for each vegetation type were recalculated, and Key deer numbers were estimated for each sea level rise scenario. Results under the worst emission scenario showed the following: (1) for case 1, the land area was reduced to 30 % of the current land area, corresponding to having about 27 deer, and (2) for case 2, the land area was reduced to 70 % of the current land area, having about 54 deer on No Name Key. The results indicated reduced non-submerged land area and less upland vegetation, particularly hardwoods/hammocks, by the year 2100. As less land area is available, a decline in Key deer population is expected as sea levels rise. Since Key deer favor upland vegetation, habitat affected by sea level rise will likely support a smaller deer population. The findings emphasize the need for precise, timely predictions of sea level rise impacts and long-term conservation strategies. Specifically designed measures are required to protect and maintain endangered wildlife, such as the Florida Key deer, residing on these vulnerable islands.

AB  - Certain plant species have traits adapted for seed dispersal by megafauna, which may be absent in their current ranges. Characterizing the dispersal mechanism of such plant species can provide insights about their population dynamics and regeneration. We investigated the effectiveness of the extant fauna as seed dispersers of the Malagasy baobab, Adansonia grandidieri, which have megafaunal dispersal traits. We documented the animal species that interact with its fruits and seeds in the canopy and on the ground through direct observations, camera trapping, opportunistic search of feces with seeds, and dispersal experiments. We also estimated seed fate using a model parameterized with data obtained through experiments on seed removal and seed germination under and away from adult A. grandidieri trees. Further, we examined the impacts of seed dispersal in mitigating herbivore pressures on A. grandidieri seedling through an exclosure experiment. We did not find animals interacting with fruits in the canopy. However, we observed a native rodent species, Eliurus myoxinus, handling fruits/seeds on the ground, and found seeds in bush pig feces. Also, while the rates of germination for the dispersed A. grandidieri seeds were low, their probability of producing viable seedlings was higher than when the seeds stayed under adult trees. We also found that the seedlings of A. grandidieri had a high probability of surviving even when herbivores were present. Overall, our results provide insights into the regeneration of A. grandidieri and suggest that some extant local ground-dwelling fauna can provide seed dispersal services to this species.Abstract in Malagasy is available with online material.
   Misy ireo hazo manana voa sy vihy lehibe ka ireo biby lehibe ihany, izay efa lany tamingana amin'izao fotoana, no afaka manaparitaka ny vihin'izy ireo. Zava-dehibe ny fahafantaran'ny fomba hanaparitahan'ireo hazo ny vihin'ny mba hanomezana vahaol & agrave;na ho an'ny famerenana ny ala. Anisan'izany ohatra ny renala, fantatra amin'ny anarana siantifika hoe Adansonia grandidieri, baobaba tsy hita amin'ny toerana voajanahary raha tsy eto Madagasikaraka ihany. Mifandraika indrindra amin'ireo karazana voa tokony aparitaky ny biby lehibe izay efa lany tamingana teto Madagasikara ny voany noho izy ireo lehibe no sady misy hodiny mafy izay mety ho sarotra amin'ny ankabeazan'ny biby mpihinam-boa ankehitriny ny manokatra azy. Tsy fantatra anefa ny fahafahan'io karazan-kazo io mivelona raha tsy eo intsony ireo biby mpanaparitaka ny vihiny. Tsy fantatra mazava ihany koa ny anjara asan'ireo biby izay mbola misy ankehitriny amin'ny fanapariahana ireo vihin'ny renala. Nanao fikarohana mahakasika ireo fomba fanaparitahana vihy misy ankehitriny izay mety hanampy amin'ny fitsirian'io baobaba Malagasy io izahay tany Andranomena sy Andranopasy (faritra Menabe, andrefan'i Madagasikara). Nijery mivantana ireo biby mety hihinana ny voa sy hanaparitaka ny vihy izahay nandritra ny 71 andro ny volana Novambra 2021 ka hatramin'ny volana Febroary 2022. Nanatanteraka ihany koa andrana mahakasika ny fitsimohan'ny vihin-drenala ihany koa izahay. Ny valin'ny fikarohana dia naneho fa tsy nisy biby hita nikasika ireo voa sy vihy teny ambony hazo; fa ny karazam-boalavo antsoina amin'ny anarana siantifika hoe Eliurus myoxinus (na sokitralina) kosa no hita nikitika ny voa sy vihy teo amin'ny tany. Midika izany fa mety manana anjara asa amin'ny fanaparitaham-bihy io karazam-boalavo io. Hita ihany koa fa ambony ny tahan'ny fitsimohan'ireo vihy eo ambanin'ny foto-kazon-drenala fa rehefa avy mitsimoka ny vihy dia ambany ny taham-pahaveloman'ireo zana-kazo ireo. Ireto voka-pikarohana ireto dia mampiseho fa ny fanaparitahana vihin'ny renala lavitry ny fotony dia mety mampiakatra kokoa ny taham-pahavelomany ary mety handray anjara amin'ny fanaparitahan'ny vihy ireo biby kely tahaka ireo voalovo. Mila fikarohana hafa anefa izany mba ahitana marina ny anjara asan'izy ireo amin'ny fanaparitahana ny vihin'ny renala ka manampy azy amin'ny fahavelomany.

AB  - Context Native mammals continue to suffer widespread and severe declines across northern Australia's tropical savannas. There is an increasing body of evidence that the primary driver of these declines is predation by feral cats (Felis catus) and that this is exacerbated by high-severity disturbance regimes (frequent high-intensity fires, and grazing and trampling by exotic megaherbivores) that simplify habitat, thereby increasing hunting efficiency. The large islands off the northern Australian coast - where some threats are either reduced or absent - provide a means of testing the conceptual model's predictions. Aims To compare the trajectory and distribution of native mammal populations on two large, adjacent islands with markedly different disturbance regimes. Methods In 2020 and 2021, we resurveyed 111 historical sites across the two largest of the Tiwi Islands, Bathurst Island (42 sites) and Melville Island (69 sites) that were previously surveyed between 2000 and 2002. The Melville Island sites had also been resurveyed in 2015. We used the same live trapping method used in 2000-2002, supplemented with camera trapping. Key results On Bathurst Island, feral cats are rare, and we found no significant decrease in native mammal trap success or species richness, and the threatened brush-tailed rabbit-rat (Conilurus penicillatus melibius) appears stable. Conversely, cats occurred at relatively high abundance on Melville Island, and there was a 52% decline in trap success, a 47% reduction in species richness, and a 93% decline in trap success for the brush-tailed rabbit-rat over the 20-year period. The highest decreases in native mammal abundance and richness were in areas that were frequently burnt and had higher activity of feral cats. In contrast, in the absence of cats on Bathurst Island, native mammal abundance increased in frequently burnt areas. Conclusions While Bathurst Island remains one of Australia's most important refuges for native mammals, neighbouring Melville Island is experiencing severe and ongoing mammal decline. We contend that this pattern primarily reflects the high abundance of cats on Melville Island compared to Bathurst Island.

AB  - Both natural and anthropogenic forces can play a substantial role in the demographic history and current structure of a wildlife population. Species with strict habitat requirements are especially susceptible to these impacts. Mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) in Alaska are of particular interest in this regard due to their influence on alpine ecosystems, importance to human cultures, and enigmatic history in some areas. Here, we used genetic tools to examine the population structure and demographic history of mountain goats in Alaska. We genotyped 816 mountain goats at 18 microsatellites, identified the number of genetically distinct subpopulations, and assessed their genetic diversity. We used Bayesian methods to investigate demographic history relative to the known geologic and human history of Alaska, and we simulated human-mediated translocation events onto islands to address the hypothesis that Baranof Island harbored an extant population prior to an early 20th-century introduction. We showed that Alaska has 4 genetically distinct subpopulations of mountain goats. The main demographic split between Southcentral and Southeast Alaska occurred following the retreat of ice after the Last Glacial Maximum. Simulations of translocation events largely aligned with expected genetic diversity patterns of current subpopulations except for Baranof Island which showed greater diversity than the simulation, consistent with the hypothesis of an endemic population prior to the translocation. This study highlights the value of considering both natural and anthropogenic forces when assessing the biogeographic history of a species and provides new insights about the complex demographic history and biogeography of mountain goats in Alaska.
   We investigate the biogeographic and anthropogenic impacts on Mountain Goat distribution and genetic diversity in Alaska. We found that patterns are tied to vicariance following the Last Glacial Maximum. Translocation analysis revealed high genetic diversity on Baranof Island, suggesting that mountain goats inhabited the island prior to the translocation.

AB  - Australia's largest land carnivore, the dingo, has been targeted by control programs in many agricultural landscapes since European settlement because of the judgement that dingoes cause costs to producers through the killing of livestock. As Australian pastoralists, we challenge the assumption that dingoes will only cause costs to producers. Based on our personal experiences and from research, we provide an alternative view, namely that in certain circumstances, there are major economic and ecological benefits of maintaining dingoes in grazing landscapes by controlling the unmanaged grazing pressure. As cattle producers, we have obtained significant financial gains for our family businesses, and environmental benefits on our properties by maintaining dingoes. Dingoes greatly reduce high-density populations of larger kangaroo species and some feral animals, especially goats. Such unmanaged grazing is persistently identified as a major factor in landscape degradation across large areas of Australian rangelands. The Australian pastoral industry as a whole, and the government departments that support it, need to evaluate, consider and discuss the economic and ecological benefits as well as the costs of maintaining dingoes in Australian pastoral landscapes.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances drive global biodiversity loss, necessitating continuous conservation efforts to protect threatened species through reintroductions. Post-reintroduction success depends critically on interspecific interactions between reintroduced populations and sympatric native or invasive species. We used camera-trapping data collected in the urban landscape of Shanghai to examine how native Chinese hare (Lepus sinensis) and free-ranging dogs (Canis familiaris) impacted the spatiotemporal behavior of reintroduced Chinese water deer (Hydropotes inermis). Results indicate that the deer exhibited an uncommon unimodal diurnal activity pattern and temporally avoided sympatric mammals. Chinese water deer tended to avoid areas frequently used by both dogs and hares. Deer adopted fine-scale spatial-temporal segregation to avoid direct encounters with pack-hunting dogs during the day, prompting deer to increase their daytime activity. Consequently, a notable decrease in dusk activity was observed, which may represent an adaptive strategy to further separate from hares temporally, ultimately facilitating coexistence between these species. Evaluating the trade-offs between spatial and temporal responses is crucial for developing management practices and ensuring the long-term sustainability of urban biodiversity.

AB  - Salinity gradient directly influences the composition and distribution of biological communities from upstream to downstream of the estuary. In this middle-scale study, a large dataset (10 rocky sections of 3 islands) of the Hangzhou Bay and Zhoushan Sea allowed thoroughly analyzing salinity and seasonal gradients and relating macrobenthos distributions and community structure to environment factors. In general, distinct regional differences were found in the distribution, diversity and community structures of macrobenthos. Abundance and biomass in all regions were dominated by suspension feeders and increased along the estuarine gradient. Significant seasonal differences were found in the abundance and biomass of herbivores, and significant regional differences were found in the abundance and biomass of suspension feeders. Redundancy analysis showed that water temperature was the dominant factor for the low-salt region, suspended particulate matter was the dominant factor for the mid-salt region, and water temperature as well as chlorophyll-a were the dominant factors for the high-salt region. These results showed that at a middle-scale estuary a considerable fraction of the variation in distribution and community structure of the intertidal macrobenthos correlated very well with environmental factors (salinity, water temperature, chlorophyll-a and suspended particulate matter).

AB  - Active forest management and maintenance or restoration of biodiversity are intertwined. We describe several Central European forest types through typical management cycles and identify synergies and trade-offs with biodiversity conservation. Synergies emerge when the maintenance of forest structures supporting recognized human needs for biomass production create diverse habitats. On the stand level, relevant are tending interventions during stand development, the length of the production cycle, and the choice of tree species. Thinning promotes forest productivity, enhances structural heterogeneity, and the habitat diversity for many species groups. The vertical and horizontal diversity on the stand level is high in uneven-aged multi-species forests. The choice of the rotation period is controversial, because no balance between forest productivity, stand stability, and habitat quality is yet negotiated. On the landscape level heterogeneity arises when many actors implement a range of silvicultural concepts and management intensities. Deadwood of different dimensions provides multiple habitats and enhances biodiversity, but causes challenges for forest protection in some forest types. A possible compromise is setting aside unmanaged interconnected units with veteran trees (stepping-stone habitats). Damage caused by wildlife is an un-resolved issue in Central European forests. High ungulate populations are reducing the potentially emerging diversity of tree species by selective browsing. A controversial topic is the introduction of non-native tree species, potentially filling in where native tree species cannot cope with expected future site conditions. Their introduction may lead into uncharted territory with respect to biotic threats. In conclusion, the knowledge-based discourse between nature conservation and forest management needs to be continued to further develop the successful concept of multiple-use forestry.

AB  - This paper presents the first quantitative assessment of the rocky reef ecology of St Helena, a remote island in the central tropical Atlantic. Monitoring data were used to characterise different habitat types found around St Helena. These findings were compared with 9 other locations in the tropical Atlantic, in different biogeographic, oceanic and reef settings, along with the environmental variables known to limit coral reef formation. St Helena's rocky and boulder reefs had similar to 50% cover dominated by turf and other filamentous algae, with lower levels of sessile invertebrates (15%) and macroalgae (4%). Both coral and rocky reef comparison locations also showed a dominance of turf and filamentous algae, with higher levels of macroalgae and sessile invertebrates in areas with higher nutrient concentrations (e.g. south-east continental Brazil). Coral growth in St Helena appeared to be limited by cool average sea temperatures of 22 degrees C, which is near, but not below, accepted lower thresholds for reef formation. The main trophic groups of fish found on rocky reefs in St Helena were comparable to other Atlantic rocky and coral reefs, with a dominance of planktivores, mobile invertivores and roving herbivores, with the major difference in trophic structure being driven by more planktivores in oceanic vs. continental versus locations. St Helena's narrow rocky coastal strip varied little in terms of reef geomorphology, resulting in high homogeneity around the island. However, endemic fish were numerous, demonstrating that isolation has produced a unique tropical Atlantic marine assemblage.

AB  - Mainstream biodiversity conservation continues to emphasise the rapid disappearance of charismatic megafauna. Fungi are ignored, partially because many are invisible. However, their conservation is of growing concern because their decline signals a decrease in overall biodiversity and losses in ecosystem integrity and function. Social science engagement with microbes is of growing interest because the diverse characteristics of fungal bodies create new entry points for conservation. Using data collected over three years from literature review, lab ethnography, and interviews, this paper develops two new concepts intended to operate at the intersection of these discussions. A review of the fungal conservation literature finds mainstream species conservation an ill fit for fungi. Drawing from the literature on ecosystem function and conservation biopolitics, I introduce the term 'functional collectives' to reframe the role of fungi in nature through a focus on fungal bodies. Acknowledging the extraordinary diversity of fungi and their relative unknowability, I further introduce the concept of 'conservation of abundance'. A focus on abundance rather than scarcity meets the needs expressed by fungal conservationists for habitat protection and conservation based on available knowledge. Both concepts align with the biophysical realities of fungi while also answering growing calls within social conservation for conviviality and care.

AB  - Spatiotemporal distribution of batoids was studied from the samples collected monthly using an Otter trawl during survey 2009-2011 and seasonally during survey 2014-2015 on the shelf and upper slope (shelf break) of the Gulf of Antalya. The study area had both a fishing zone and a non-fishing zone. Eleven batoid species were found. Seven species was found only on the shelf, one on the shelf break, and two in both zones. Recently, abundance and number of species have decreased by year. Distribution of the skates was contrasted to that of the rays along the bottom depth gradient. Raja clavata, Raja miraletus, and Dasyatis pastinaca were common and frequent species. Dasyatis centroura was an occasional visitor. The batoid abundance had two minimum periods, early summer and late autumn. Maximum values occurred in April and July. There were two types of the dispersal distribution of the batoids along the bottom depth gradient: the unimodally-distributed species peaked abundance at 75-100 m or at 300 m, and the bimodal distribution was composed of ubiquitous species of the batoids. This distribution was more pronounced in survey 2014-2015. The batoid assemblages were discriminated by a seafloor depth of 125 m, comprising the assemblages of the shallower and greater depth. The species-environment relation was correlated positively with bottom depths, near-bottom chl-a, and finest bioseston and negatively correlated with Secchi disk depth and water salinity. However, seasonal discrimination did not occur. The fishing effort, which was low in the present area, was not significantly correlated with any of the faunistic characters (abundance, biomass, and diversity indices). In relation of the batoids to the megafauna, the batoids were positively correlated with cephalopods, holoturids, and decapods but negatively correlated with stomatopods and bivalves.

AB  - Understanding the responses of non-native plants to climate change while accounting for biotic interactions is key to predicting and mitigating future invasion risks. Non-native invasive plants may benefit from or decline in the face of climate change, relative to native competitors. Non-native plants might also suffer less than native plants from natural enemies such as herbivores, which could give non-natives a competitive advantage. However, we lack an understanding of how non-native plants will compete with native plants in a warming climate, while accounting for the effects of herbivore pressure. To test the potential interactions between warming, herbivore pressure and competition, we set up a common-garden experiment in Trondheim, Norway, using five non-native plants growing either alone or in competition with a native plant community. These plants were subjected to herbivore exclusion and artificial warming treatments, using open-top chambers. We found that under warming, three non-native species had greater biomass and all five species were taller than when grown without warming. Competition with native species reduced the biomass of three non-native species and herbivore exclusion resulted in taller plants for three non-native species. Native community biomass was not affected by either warming or herbivore exclusion. Furthermore, the native community was not affected by competition with any non-native plant except Centaurea montana, which resulted in lower native community biomass, suggesting that C. montana is likely to be the most detrimental of these non-native species to native communities. Competition with natives reduced the positive effects of warming on biomass for only one species, Alchemilla mollis. Our study strongly suggests that a warming climate may benefit invasive plants more than native plants, but for some species these effects will be mediated by biotic interactions in idiosyncratic ways, depending on the identity of both native and non-native species. This will present a challenge to predicting plant invasion success under climate change while accounting for biotic interactions.

AB  - The population dynamics of most tropical insects are unknown and long-term monitoring programmes are urgently needed to evaluate a possible insect decline in the tropics. In this context, functional groups can be used effectively to summarise time-series for species-rich taxa. Neotropical dung beetles have often been catalogued into functional groups, but close relatives also of ecological significance, the Dynastinae, are awaiting such a classification. Here, we examine the functional groups of Dynastinae at the regional (Panama: 147 species) and local (Barro Colorado Island, BCI: 56 species) scales. Our optimum classification of Panamanian species distinguished five groups, one of which is probably artificial and accounts for species ecologically poorly known. Ecological attributes or species traits mainly influencing the delineation of groups were geographical distribution, body length, seasonal aggregation, larval food and whether the adult may be present in decaying wood. Our analyses indicated that (1) missing trait values and the high percentage of 'cryptic' species (25%) influenced the delineation of groups; (2) the dendrogram similarity of functional groups versus phylogenetic tree was low, although some traits were phylogenetically conserved; and (3) the overall structure of functional groups was conserved when comparing regional and local data, suggesting no drastic loss of functional groups locally. To proceed with the functional classification of poorly known tropical insects, we recommend a cautious selection of traits a priori, inclusion of 'cryptic' species recognised by DNA barcoding, and building phylogenies, which may allow a careful taxonomic imputation to complete species-traits matrices.

AB  - As transportation infrastructure expands to accommodate increasing human population growth, wildlife-vehicle conflicts (WVCs) are a growing concern for motorist safety and wildlife populations. In the case of large ungulates, minimal information exists on successful mitigation of WVCs involving bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) and habitat fragmentation. Too address this void, we evaluated the effectiveness of 3 new wildlife overpasses, 3 culverts, 2 bridges, and ungulate exclusionary fencing as potential desert bighorn sheep (O. c. nelsoni; sheep) crossing opportunities along US Highway 93 in Arizona, USA. We evaluated sheep movements using global positioning system (GPS) radio-transmitter collars and remote cameras for 4 years from March 2011 to March 2015 and sheep-vehicle collision data collected from 2011 to 2020. Although GPS determined pre- and post-mitigation passage rates of sheep that crossed US Highway 93 were initially similar, they increased every year and were on average 217% higher following inclusion of wildlife crossings and by year 4 had ultimately increased 633% from pre-construction rates. Cameras recorded 6,936 crossings by a dozen wildlife species with sheep accounting for 95% of all crossings. Sheep used the 3 overpasses (90% of all sheep crossings) disproportionately more than the 3 culverts and 2 underpasses (10% of all sheep crossings) in the same area, and use of the 3 overpasses increased 905% in the first year. Sheep initially used the 30-m-wide overpasses at 83% and 175% higher passage rates than 2 15-m-wide structures; however, by year 4 passage rates were similar across overpasses. From February 2011 through February 2020, we documented 0.8 sheep-vehicle collisions/year for an overall 93.3% reduction from the 12 collisions per year previously documented. Most of the collisions occurred immediately following completion of the project and gradually reduced as sheep access points were identified and addressed through an adaptive mitigation process to iteratively improve success. Overpasses appear to be the preferred wildlife crossing type for sheep and when properly located and linked with ungulate exclusion fencing successfully reduced collisions and habitat fragmentation. These findings add to our knowledge base of effective roadway mitigation for different species. Longterm monitoring informs species learning curves, preference of wildlife crossing structure type, and adaptive mitigation opportunities to increase effectiveness of mitigation measures on current and future projects.

AB  - Active management such as prescribed fire and thinning can restore savanna and prairie ecosystem to maintain a full suite of ecosystem services and create suitable habitat for wildlife species such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Active management comes with the cost of management and acceptance of management tools. The south-central transitional ecoregion of the USA, which otherwise was a mixture of forest, savanna, and tallgrass prairie, is increasing in woody plant dominance due to the exclusion of fire and other anthropogenic factors. Deer hunting is a vital source of revenue generation to offset the landowner's management cost in the region. We studied Oklahoma landowners' perceptions regarding active and sustainable management of forest and rangeland for deer habitat using two established theories of reasoned action and planned behavior as well as expanded theories adding moral norms. We analyzed mailed survey data using structural equation modeling. We found that subjective norms and perceived behavior control significantly affected deer hunting intention when moral norms were introduced into the model. Attitudes independently significantly affected intentions of deer hunting but have negative relations with the intentions. The study suggested that landowners have positive social pressure and were interested in active management but associated financial burden and risk could be shaping negative attitudes.

AB  - Simple Summary Adaptation to new environments by reintroducing banteng (Bos javanicus) is important for sustainable conservation and habitat management. The aims of this study were to test whether increased human disturbance in the edge area affects animal movement, territory size, and even the area of use in Salakphra Wildlife Sanctuary. Using camera traps, we found that the reintroduced banteng preferred salt licks and more distance from ponds. In the core area, the area of use was decreased, followed by the adaptation to the new habitat by the reintroduced banteng. In the edge area, the area of use was smaller than in the core area due to the increased disturbance from human activities. We suggest that the reintroduction program should be conducted in the core area rather than in the edge area, and controlling human activities at the edge may increase the area of use for the reintroduced banteng population in the future. Monitoring of banteng (Bos javanicus) after reintroduction is important for their management. This study aimed to monitor the preferred habitat and area of use of reintroduced banteng at the core (13 banteng) and the edge (three banteng) of Salakphra Wildlife Sanctuary between 2019 and 2021 and compared the finding with previous studies conducted from 2014 to 2019. The Binary Logistic Regression (BLR) showed the most preferred, moderately preferred, and least preferred areas were 44.7 km(2), 1.2 km(2), and 54.1 km(2) in the dry season, and 25.9 km(2), 1.0 km(2), and 9.3 km(2) in the wet season, respectively. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) showed the most preferred, moderately preferred, and least preferred areas as 12.1 km(2), 17.3 km(2), and 65.9 km(2), respectively. Banteng have previously been found close to ponds and salt licks. The area of use size, as determined by Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), was 20.3 km(2) and 6.5 km(2), respectively. Three banteng were reintroduced to the edge area in 2020. The edge area was temporarily utilized by these individuals. In the core area, the area of use in this study decreased compared to the previous studies from 2014 to 2019, indicating they were able to find their preferred habitat. This study suggested that, if the area is managed appropriately, banteng will be able to live in a smaller habitat, and we will be able to restore the banteng population in the future.

AB  - The loss of consumers threatens the integrity of ecological systems, but the mechanisms underlying the effects on communities and ecosystems remain difficult to predict. This is, in part, due to the complex roles that consumers play in those systems. Here, we highlight this complexity by quantifying two mechanisms by which molluscan grazers-typically thought of as consumers of their algal resources-facilitate algae on rocky shores. Initial observations in high-zone tide pools revealed that both water-column ammonium concentrations and photosynthetic biomass were higher in pools containing higher densities of grazers, suggesting that local-scale nutrient recycling by the grazers could be enhancing algal biomass. We assessed this possibility by experimentally manipulating grazer abundances at the level of whole tide pools but controlling access of those grazers to experimental plots within each pool. Contrary to predictions that algal biomass inside grazer exclusions would increase as grazer abundances in the pools increased, we found that algal biomass inside grazer-exclusion fences was unaffected by grazer abundances. Instead, the consumptive effects of grazers that were evident at low grazer abundances transitioned to facilitative effects as experimentally manipulated grazer abundances increased. This finding suggested that these positive interactions were associated with the physical presence of grazers and not just grazers' effects on nutrient availability. Subsequent experiments highlighted the potential role of "slime"-the pedal mucous trails left behind as the mollusks crawl on the substratum-in promoting the recruitment of algae and thereby mediating a spatial subsidy of new organic matter into the system. Furthermore, different grazer groups contributed disproportionately to ammonium excretion (i.e., turban snails) versus slime production (i.e., littorine snails), suggesting a potential role for grazer diversity. Our work highlights the complex ways in which consumers affect their resources, including multiple, complementary mechanisms by which these grazers facilitate the algae they consume.

AB  - Animals in urban areas can be exposed to human-mediated land use change and radiant heat (called urban heat island effect). Few studies have empirically evaluated the effects of urban heat on wild vertebrates. We live-trapped desert wild rodents from a large metropolitan area in the Sonoran Desert, USA, across seven field sites spanning three strata of land surface temperatures. During the summers of 2019 and 2020, we captured 116 adult pocket mice (Chaetodipus spp. and Perognathus spp.) and Merriam's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami) in mountainous urban parks and open spaces. We measured body condition, proxy for health, using percent body fat (i.e., fat mass divided by body mass). For mammals, this parameter estimates the storage of energy-rich fat, which is important for growth, survival, and reproduction. We measured body condition using a noninvasive quantitative magnetic resonance instrument. Site-level surface temperatures were measured using data loggers and long-term climate data. Results supported the prediction that body condition was greatest in cooler temperature strata compared to the hottest areas. To relate body condition to resource availability, we evaluated vegetation cover and degree of urbanization. Body fat of adult pocket mice was greater in areas with more vegetation cover and where nighttime temperatures and surface temperatures were lower and urbanization was greater. Kangaroo rats had more fat in areas with the lowest strata of surface temperature. These results demonstrate that extreme heat negatively covaries with small mammal body condition, which indicates that urbanization and climate change have the potential to reduce rodent fitness.

AB  - Restoring native woodlands to areas where they have been lost is a key element for tackling the nature and climate crises. Natural regeneration offers the potential to achieve this cheaply and at scale, but browsing ungulates like deer can inhibit this or alter the pattern of regeneration. This issue is particularly pronounced in the Scottish Highlands, a heavily deforested region with high deer numbers.We describe the work of the 60,000 ha landscape restoration partnership, Cairngorms Connect, in speeding up natural woodland expansion. We use 30 years of regeneration monitoring to show a consistent, large-scale expansion of native woodland, largely through natural regeneration alongside deer culling, without the use of fences. This was achieved across the partnership, despite differing management histories and land-managing organisations (comprising two statutory agencies, one private landowner and one non-governmental organisation).During peak periods of woodland expansion, the area of new woodland (i.e. exceeding 100 trees per hectare) increased by 1.2%, 1.7%, 2.7% and 6.0% annually in the four landholdings' regeneration zones, equating to a total of approximately 164 ha annually of new woodland.Natural regeneration is however patchy and hard to predict. Higher levels of management intervention may be needed to increase species that are rarer, more palatable or further from seed sources; we recommend long-term field trials to inform this, such as those underway in Cairngorms Connect. Further research should develop techniques for remote sensing of woodland expansion, verified against field data and combined with the development of process-based models to enable us to predict the outcomes of different management scenarios.Synthesis and applications. We show that collaborative deer management across multiple adjoining landholdings can achieve rapid landscape-scale native woodland expansion with minimal need for planting or fencing. Our results show the power of monitoring regeneration directly, to inform deer management for an area. We demonstrate that by uniting over a shared vision, organisations with differing management approaches and histories can build understanding alongside landscape-scale ecological restoration.

AB  - There is strong trait dependence in species-level responses to environmental change and their cascading effects on ecosystem functioning. However, there is little understanding of whether intraspecific trait variation (ITV) can also be an important mechanism mediating environmental effects on ecosystem functioning. This is surprising, given that global change processes such as habitat fragmentation and the creation of forest edges drive strong trait shifts within species. On 20 islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China, we quantified intraspecific leaf trait shifts of a widely distributed shrub species, Vaccinium carlesii, in response to habitat fragmentation. Using a reciprocal transplant decomposition experiment between forest edge and interior on 11 islands with varying areas, we disentangled the relative effects of intraspecific leaf trait variation versus altered environmental conditions on leaf decomposition rates in forest fragments. We found strong intraspecific variation in leaf traits in response to edge effects, with a shift toward recalcitrant leaves with low specific leaf area and high leaf dry matter content from forest interior to the edge. Using structural equation modeling, we showed that such intraspecific leaf trait response to habitat fragmentation had translated into significant plant afterlife effects on leaf decomposition, leading to decreased leaf decomposition rates from the forest interior to the edge. Importantly, the effects of intraspecific leaf trait variation were additive to and stronger than the effects from local environmental changes due to edge effects and habitat loss. Our experiment provides the first quantitative study showing that intraspecific leaf trait response to edge effects is an important driver of the decrease in leaf decomposition rate in fragmented forests. By extending the trait-based response-effect framework toward the individual level, intraspecific variation in leaf economics traits can provide the missing functional link between environmental change and ecological processes. These findings suggest an important area for future research on incorporating ITV to understand and predict changes in ecosystem functioning in the context of global change.

AB  - Simple Summary The increase in the productivity of dairy buffaloes is one of the main factors for the introduction of intensive management systems and the mechanization of daily production activities. Machine milking can be considered as a critical point, as a process that is repeated at least twice a day and includes physical and psychological stressors: machine settings and maintenance, a new environment, calf separation and closeness to a person are potential sources of chronic stress, which negatively affect some aspects of buffalo behavior, welfare and productivity. Buffalo behavior during milking is an extremely important tool for determining the temperament of the animal, which in turn is essential for determining the level of welfare and conditioning of this activity, thus minimizing the problems and consequences for both animals and people who serve them. There are no recent studies to evaluate the milk temperament score of Bulgarian Murrah buffaloes in Bulgaria and how it affects their milk productivity, which is why we conducted our study.Abstract The goal of this research was to evaluate milking temperament and its relationship with test-day milk (TDMY0) yield in Bulgarian Murrah buffaloes. This study involved 90 buffalo cows reared under a tie-stall production system which were milked twice a day with a milking pipeline. The behavioral responses of the buffaloes were reported during preparation for milking and during actual milking. The average temperament score during preparation for milking was 1.83, and 1.93 during milking itself. The most common reaction was leg lifting (18.9%), followed by cows moving on the stall bed (10%), definite kicking (9.9%), and 13.3% managing to remove the milking cluster during milking. The frequency of buffaloes showing adverse reactions (scores 4 and 5) increased considerably during milking compared to preparation for milking. Repeated scoring of temperament during the same lactation did not show a significant difference in the frequency of temperament assessments both in preparation for milking and during milking. The minimal difference may be due to the accuracy of the assessment or a momentary change in the condition of the animals during the two scorings. Cows with the most unwanted milking behavior (scores 5 and 4) had the highest LS means for TDMY, 8.18 kg and 7.65 kg, respectively. The reasons for these buffaloes remaining until later lactations was their high milk yield and the injection of oxytocin before milking, which helps them to be fully milked.

AB  - Invasive species are one of many anthropogenic challenges to maintaining a healthy marine ecosystem. Two rabbitfish species (Siganus rivulatus and Siganus luridus) are among the more successful migrants from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, where their intense foraging has caused damage to the algae community, thus reducing primary production and habitat complexity, and impacting nurseries for early life stages. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the impact of rabbitfish on algae is lower in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) although rabbitfish densities are similar in protected and fished areas. One explanation could be that fear of predators, more often present inside MPAs and an important component of a healthy marine ecosystem, reduces the ecological impacts of rabbitfish. This research aimed to test if such fear effects do occur in rabbitfish. Using controlled mesocosm experiments, we tested S. rivulatus reactions to two chemical predation cues: chemical alarm cues released from a recently killed conspecific fish, and water-borne cues from a tank with a live grouper predator, Epinephelus marginatus. We found that rabbitfish significantly reduce their overall food consumption as well as their bites per minute when exposed to the alarm cue, but not when exposed to the grouper water cue. These results support the idea that MPAs, which effectively increase the density of large piscivores and hence predation, can mitigate the impact of invasive herbivorous species. If the mesocosm results can scale up to natural systems, predation cues may be artificially introduced to other target areas in order to reduce rabbitfish grazing outside reserves. Thus, this study provides information that can be used to manage the ecological impacts caused by invasive rabbitfish, both inside and outside of marine reserves.

AB  - Sandy beaches are home to a diverse array of macrobenthic communities that serve as important indicators of ecological health. This study examined the spatiotemporal variability in macrobenthic assemblages along the sandy beach of Clifton, considering environmental factors such as temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and the monsoon season. A total of 10 sites, covering an approximate sea area of 10 km (Clifton, Karachi coast, Pakistan), were sampled monthly from January to October 2024 to understand the community structure of macrobenthic communities and their relationships under ecological and environmental factors. Ten species of macrobenthic assemblage, eight molluscans, four bivalves and four gastropods, and two crustaceans were identified. Balanus trigonus (mean 188.3 +/- 72.5) and Babylonia spirata (127.1 +/- 54.6), the two most prevalent species, achieved their maximum abundance in June (mid monsoon, 198 individuals) and March (early monsoon, 297 individuals), respectively. The study of the marine species abundance data using the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) revealed faint, non-linear seasonal trends, enhancing and expanding on the patterns. Plankton blooms and favourable breeding conditions coincide with the warmer months of March through August, when Balanus trigonus and Babylonia spirata exhibit observable peaks. The GAM emphasizes the ecological differences among Anadara species: While A. indica exhibits a low-abundance, flat curve, suggesting either competitive exclusion or niche divergence, A. inequivalvis shows a robust summer peak. Stable species, such as Neverita didyma, exhibited near-linear patterns, indicating low seasonal susceptibility. A noteworthy late-season surge in Portunus sanguinolentus could be the consequence of a reproductive strategy or predator-prey dynamic. Effective Degrees of Freedom (EDF) showed that temperature, salinity, DO, and macrobenthic community structure were all substantially correlated. Furthermore, long-term monitoring is required on the sandy shore of Clifton, a crucial habitat for macrobenthic communities.

AB  - Introduction The loss of genetic diversity is a critical factor in the extinction process, exacerbated by anthropogenic pressures and demographic stochasticity, particularly in small populations. Traditional population restoration methods, such as individual translocation and ecological corridors, present challenges, including high costs, adaptation difficulties, pathogen introduction, and outbreeding risks. Embryo reintroduction has emerged as a potential strategy for genetic rescue. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of embryo transfer as a genetic rescue tool in the marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus), a species classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN.Methods Following the construction of the S & eacute;rgio Motta Hydroelectric Power Plant (UHSM) in 1998, a population of over 1,000 marsh deer was impacted, leading to the capture of 93 individuals for ex situ (82) and in situ (11) conservation efforts. Between 1998 and 2001, an experimental reintroduction program established a new population in a 2,000-hectare wetland near the Jata & iacute; Ecological Station (EEJ) in Luis Ant & ocirc;nio, S & atilde;o Paulo, Brazil. Over time, this population reached a carrying capacity of 25 individuals but experienced genetic diversity loss. To address this, we conducted an embryo transfer experiment using a female from the reintroduced population as a receipt for embryos from the captive population. The female, captured during late pregnancy, was subjected to estrous cycle synchronization for embryo transfer after giving birth and being apart from its fawn. Two embryos from a captive population were implanted, and the female was re-released after 10 days. Monitoring was conducted via radio transmitter collar (GPS-GSM) and helicopter tracking.Results The female did not give birth to the implanted embryos but was recaptured nine months later for an ultrasonographic evaluation, which indicated a six-month pregnancy. This suggests that the implanted embryos were lost early in gestation, but natural fertilization occurred approximately three months post-release.Discussion This study demonstrates the technical feasibility of embryo reintroduction as a genetic rescue strategy, even though pregnancy was not carried to term. The ability to capture, temporarily hold, and successfully reintroduce a free-ranging female suggests minimal disruption to natural behaviors. Future improvements in embryo quality, hormonal protocols, and pregnancy confirmation prior to release could enhance the success rate of this method. Embryo reintroduction presents a promising alternative to traditional reintroduction methods, offering a novel approach to mitigating genetic risks in small, isolated populations.

AB  - The European bison (wisent) Bison bonasus is not only the largest terrestrial mammal in Europe, but also an example of the successful restitution and reintroduction of a species that became extinct in nature at the beginning of the 20th century. Even so, it remains a rare, protected species, and one susceptible to varied threats, including diseases. It has a specific parasitofauna, comprising only a few specific species retained with the last hosts in the restitution process, and some others acquired from other ungulates, or via environmental interactions. The current data on parasitic arthropods originated from the winter season, and less frequently, from autumn and early spring. The present study contains the first information on the occurrence of arthropods in the European bison (n = 6) in the summer season, which is the period of their increased activity. Data on the seasonal and populational dynamics of ectoparasites have been verified; specific parasite species (Demodex bisonianus, Bisonicola sedecimdecembrii, and recently described Demodex bialoviensis) and typical parasite species (Chorioptes bovis, Ixodes ricinus) have been recorded. The data refer to the information from other study periods, summarizing and valorizing data on parasitic arthropods in the form of a global checklist. These arthropods occur in European bison frequently (prevalence reaches up to 100%), but they are present in small numbers, and do not present a burden for the host; only sometimes, with high intensity of infection, they cause parasitoses (chorioptosis, mallohagosis). However, as an effect of regular activity, by penetrating the skin of the host, they create gateways for secondary infections, and hematophagous parasites (e.g., ticks) can be vectors of pathogens that can be hazardous, even at low infection levels. The identification of the parasitological threats faced by European bison is not only important from the standpoint of the study object, i.e., the Bialowieza Forest European bison population, from which the existing bison population of Europe has been derived, but also the fact that their transfer to different parts of Europe can entail the additional transfer of their parasites.

AB  - For decades, many freshwater fishes native to North America have been written off as "rough fish" and neglected as inconsequential or even scorned if perceived as inimical to traditional gamefish. Across the continent, the exact species included in this category vary but often include members of the families Lepisosteidae, Amiidae, Hiodontidae, Catostomidae, Ictaluridae, and Sciaenidae. The casual or callous treatment of these fishes, although occasionally questioned by diversity-minded scientists and the public for at least a century, has recently come under more widespread scientific scrutiny, as more holistic views of ecosystems and ecosystem-based management are increasingly embraced and implemented. Paradoxically, we are also in an era where increasing technological capabilities have exacerbated the casual disposal of native fishes via bowfishing and other methods, often followed by widespread publicity through social media. Amid this rapid technological evolution, recent scientific studies have identified and highlighted the long lifespans, erratic recruitment, and surprisingly complex stock composition and life histories of many of these neglected fishes. Conservation of these distinctive and fragile taxa has been initiated under the recognition of this life history diversity. As exemplified by the 23 articles in this Special Issue on "Underappreciated Native Fishes of North America and their Management" and highlighted in this introductory article, research on many of these taxa has surged, as has their need for management. Scientific discoveries during this timeframe have redefined our understanding of several of the species and have led to an enlightened appreciation of these fishes and their valuable roles in freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Energy flow through consumer-resource interactions is largely determined by body size. Allometric relationships govern the dynamics of populations by impacting rates of reproduction as well as alternative sources of mortality, which have differential impacts on smaller to larger organisms. Here we derive and investigate the timescales associated with four alternative sources of mortality for terrestrial mammals: mortality from starvation, mortality associated with aging, mortality from consumption by predators, and mortality introduced by anthropogenic subsidized harvest. The incorporation of these allometric relationships into a minimal consumer-resource model illuminates central constraints that may contribute to the structure of mammalian communities. Our framework reveals that while starvation largely impacts smaller-bodied species, the allometry of senescence is expected to be more difficult to observe. In contrast, external predation and subsidized harvest have greater impacts on the populations of larger-bodied species. Moreover, the inclusion of predation mortality reveals mass thresholds for mammalian herbivores, where dynamic instabilities may limit the feasibility of megafaunal populations. We show how these thresholds vary with alternative predator-prey mass relationships, which are not well understood within terrestrial systems. Finally, we use our framework to predict the harvest pressure required to induce mass-specific extinctions, which closely align with previous estimates of anthropogenic megafaunal exploitation in both paleontological and historical contexts. Together our results underscore the tenuous nature of megafaunal populations and how different sources of mortality may contribute to their ephemeral nature over evolutionary time.

AB  - Spanish National Parks (NPs) are protected areas for biodiversity conservation, including two Maritime-Terrestrian NPs: The Atlantic Islands of Galicia, PNIA (NW Spain) and Archipelago of Cabrera, PNAC (Balearic Islands). This study was aimed to conduct a 3-year genetic survey of syngnathid fish species (i.e. seahorses and pipefish) identified in both NPs and nearby unprotected areas, using mitochondrial and microsatellite markers. A diversity of species was identified with differential distribution among NPs and adjacent areas studied. Pipefish (Syngnathus acus, S. abaster, S. typhle, Entelurus aequoreus, Nerophis lumbriciformis, N. maculatus, and N. ophidion) predominated, while seahorses (Hippocampus guttulatus) were much less abundant. Genetic data and phylogenetic analysis clarified in situ morphological identification. Mitochondrial haplotypes for each species clustered into monophyletic groups, supporting the identification of a cryptic lineage of S. abaster in PNAC distinct from eastern Mediterranean populations of this species. Intraspecific genetic diversity was evaluated at spatial and temporal scale for population samples recorded during the survey period, providing valuable information for individual resampling traceability and delineating management units. Temporal stability in genetic diversity and gene flow with adjacent areas were observed for dominant species within each NP in the 3-year period studied. However, significant intraspecific differentiation was detected between populations identified in Atlantic and Mediterranean NPs. This study provides valuable reference genetic data for future monitoring and to identify distribution or research gaps for further studies towards the conservation of syngnathid populations in Spanish marine NPs, which serve as umbrella species for the preservation of vulnerable coastal ecosystems and habitats.

AB  - The response of plankton communities to short-term climatic events was studied in a narrow coral reef lagoon representative of the channel-type lagoons of the high islands of the tropical Pacific. Phyto- and zooplankton data (abundance and taxonomic composition) were sampled at high frequencies for 2 weeks in April-May 2017 under various tidal conditions and combined with environmental and physical measurements and modeling hydrodynamic products. The short-term external events (wind, waves and rain) that occurred caused changes in the circulation patterns and increased nutrient concentrations in the lagoon. The plankton reacted quickly to this enrichment, with an increase in chlorophyll a and the rapid development of a microphytoplankton community dominated by diatoms, and of opportunistic herbivorous zooplankton (tintinnids, appendicularians). Zooplankton composition and distribution were strongly modulated by the circulation patterns through advection and mixing. Our results show that the tidal and diel components of the temporal variability of planktonic groups were blurred by sporadic event components (i.e. wind, wave and rainfall events). Environmental and biological responses to these external physical forcings occurred at lagoon scale in this channel-like lagoon, unlike what is observed in larger lagoons (such as the southern lagoons of New Caledonia) where spatial variability is much higher.

AB  - The Japanese greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus nippon) is distributed widely in East Asia. Within the species, R. nippon in Northeast Asia is regarded as the lineage that diverged most recently. However, the monophyly of the Japanese populations is unclear due to insufficient data about phylogenetic relationship of the western Japanese populations. To test the monophyly of the Japanese populations of R. nippon, we sampled R. nippon from western Japan and performed a phylogeographic analysis based on mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b and the D-loop. The Northeast Asian lineage consisted of three main clades in eastern Japan (clade I), western Japan (clade II), and the continent as well as the Kumamoto population in westernmost Japan (clade III). The results of this study do not support the monophyly of the Japanese population. The findings suggest the "reverse colonization" of R. nippon from the Japanese Archipelago to the Eurasian continent, and provide important insight into the role of the island system in creation and supply of diversity to the continent.

AB  - International and national conservation policies almost exclusively focus on conserving species in their historic native ranges, thus excluding species that have been introduced by people and some of those that have extended their ranges on their own accord. Given that many of such migrants are threatened in their native ranges, conservation goals that explicitly exclude these populations may overlook opportunities to prevent extinctions and respond dynamically to rapidly changing environmental and climatic conditions. Focusing on terrestrial mammals, we quantified the number of threatened mammals that have established new populations through assisted migration (i.e., introduction). We devised 4 alternative scenarios for the inclusion of assisted-migrant populations in mainstream conservation policy with the aim of preventing global species extinctions. We then used spatial prioritization algorithms to simulate how these scenarios could change global spatial conservation priorities. We found that 22% (70 species out of 265) of all identified assisted-migrant mammals were threatened in their native ranges, mirroring the 25% of all mammals that are threatened. Reassessing global threat statuses by combining native and migrant ranges reduced the threat status of 23 species (similar to 33% of threatened assisted migrants). Thus, including migrant populations in threat assessments provides a more accurate assessment of actual global extinction risk among species. Spatial prioritization simulations showed that reimagining the role of assisted-migrant populations in preventing species extinction could increase the importance of overlooked landscapes, particularly in central Australia, Europe, and the southwestern United States. Our results indicated that these various and nonexhaustive ways to consider assisted-migrant populations, with due consideration of potential conservation conflicts with resident taxa, may provide unprecedented opportunities to prevent species extinctions.
   Prevencion de la extincion en una epoca de migracion de especies y cambios planetarios Las politicas de conservacion nacionales e internacionales casi siempre se enfocan en la conservacion de las especies dentro de su distribucion historica y nativa, por lo que se excluyen especies que han sido introducidas por el humano y algunas que se han extendido por cuenta propia mas alla de su distribucion. Ya que muchas de estas especies migrantes estan amenazadas dentro de su distribucion nativa, los objetivos de conservacion que excluyen explicitamente a estas poblaciones pueden ignorar las oportunidades para prevenir extinciones y responder de forma dinamica a las condiciones ambientales y climaticas que cambian con rapidez. Nos enfocamos en los mamiferos terrestres para cuantificar el numero de especies amenazadas que han establecido poblaciones nuevas mediante la migracion asistida (introduccion). Disenamos cuatro escenarios alternativos para la inclusion de las poblaciones con migracion asistida dentro de las politicas de conservacion generales con el objetivo de prevenir extinciones globales de especies. Despues usamos algoritmos de priorizacion espacial para simular como estos escenarios podrian cambiar las prioridades de conservacion espacial en todo el mundo. Descubrimos que el 22% (70 de 765 especies) de todos los mamiferos con migracion asistida estan amenazados dentro de su distribucion nativa, lo que es similar al 25% de especies amenazadas de todas las especies de mamiferos. La reevaluacion de los estados mundiales de amenaza mediante la combinacion de la distribucion nativa y migrante redujo el estado de amenaza de 23 especies (similar to 33% de los migrantes asistidos amenazados). Por esto, incluir a las poblaciones migrantes en la evaluacion de amenazas proporciona una evaluacion mas certera del riesgo de extincion que existe entre las especies a nivel mundial. Las simulaciones de priorizacion espacial mostraron que reinventar el papel que tienen las poblaciones con migracion asistida en la prevencion de la extincion de especies podria incrementar la importancia de los paisajes ignorados, particularmente en Australia central, Europa y el suroeste de los Estados Unidos. Nuestros resultados indican que estas maneras diversas y no exhaustivas de considerar a las poblaciones con migracion asistida, con la debida consideracion de los potenciales conflictos de conservacion con los taxones residentes, puede proporcionar oportunidades sin precedentes para prevenir la extincion de las especies.

AB  - The objective of current study was to find out the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in blue wildebeest, alpacas, and goats with same husbandry and fence site in Harbin Zoo, China. From August 2015 to August 2016, 507 fecal samples of blue wildebeest (188), alpacas (195) and goats (124) were examined for gastrointestinal parasites by saturated sodium chloride floatation technique. The microscopic analysis, based on the morphology of oocysts, indicates that the present parasites are Capillaria sp. in blue wildebeest; Eimeria christenseni, E. alijevi, Trichuris sp. and one Strongy-type species in goats; Trichuris sp., Nematodirus sp., Moniezia sp., E. macusaniensis, another Eimeria sp. and another Strongy-type (different with goats) in alpacas. It was discovered that the infection rate was 45.74%, 38.97%, and 12.09% in blue wildebeest, alpacas and goats, respectively. The hosts have different dominant parasite and diverse prevalence in different season, temperature, and humidity groups. Host specificity is the main reason for the difference of host fauna among the three ruminants. The data of the study will provide an accumulating knowledge to help preventing and controlling the spread of infectious parasitic diseases in the zoo.

AB  - Aim An increasing number of exotic plants and their biological control agents are being introduced into new regions. Therefore, it is necessary to study their interactions and to manage the future directions of plant invasions under different scenarios of temperature rise. Location China. Method We investigated the distribution patterns of the two most prevalent invasive aquatic plants in the world, Alternanthera philoxeroides and Eichhornia crassipes, at a large scale and studied the interactions of both invasive plants with their respective biological control agents, Agasicles hygrophila and Neochetina eichhorniae, in response to different scenarios of temperature rise. Results Both plants performed better in warmer climates in common garden experiments. However, large populations of A. philoxeroides occurred only in the temperate zone because this species experienced competitive exclusion from E. crassipes and suppression due to A. hygrophila herbivory in tropical and subtropical areas. Moreover, in both subtropical zones, where the two plants and A. hygrophila co-occur, and the temperate zone, where only A. philoxeroides occurs at present, A. hygrophila herbivory and the competition from E. crassipes hindered the performance of A. philoxeroides. Moreover, in the extreme high-temperature environment, A. philoxeroides performance improved, while E. crassipes performance worsened. In addition, the combination of N. eichhorniae herbivory and competition from A. philoxeroides also reduced the performance of E. crassipes, but E. crassipes still dominated when in competition with A. philoxeroides. Main conclusions Our results indicate that climate warming and the introduction of herbivores do not alter the interspecific relationship between E. crassipes and A. philoxeroides. Moreover, our study suggests that under climate warming, E. crassipes will replace A. philoxeroides as the dominant species in some communities in warm temperate zones, though extremely high-temperature events will slow this replacement process.

AB  - We described the overlap of arthropod communities between agricultural lands and adjacent wetlands using transect sampling, to determine if these juxtapositions might be influencing abundances of beneficial arthropods in agricultural lands. We further assessed experimentally whether these beneficial arthropods migrating from wetlands may potentially enhance crop productivity. Large numbers of predaceous carabid beetles and spiders moved from the wetlands into the agricultural lands; both of these groups can be important to biological control of crop pests. However, our exclusion experiments did not detect significant impacts of these predators on herbivorous insects or on crop productivity. Numerous studies have established that natural habitats adjacent to crop lands serve as refuge to beneficial arthropod communities and enhance overall biodiversity. Wetlands adjacent to agricultural lands appear to sense the same function. Our study suggests that wetlands may provide the ecosystem service of enhancing numbers of arthropods beneficial to agriculture, a service not established previously, and a factor that may motivate farmers to conserve wetlands that they own.

AB  - Deer impacts on forest vegetation have complicated attempts at forest regeneration in many parts of the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic States, and other regions. Deer overabundance limits the success of forest regeneration. One strategy is to reduce deer browsing by temporarily excluding them from regeneration harvests. Because of the costs of fence installation, maintenance, and removal, we developed and tested the feasibility and effectiveness of slash walls. In 2017, 4 regeneration harvests ranging from 4.5 to 30 ha were cut. Slash and trees of marginal value proximate to the perimeter were piled into a slash wall that averaged 3.7 m to the tallest branch and 7.2 m wide. Slash walls occupied from 0.5 to 1.5 ha of the harvest area and used approximately 28,000 kg of slash and low-grade logs per 30 m section. The rate of construction depended on topography along with access to slash and low-grade trees. Construction rates for slash walls varied from 32 m/hr to 77 m/hr. The average cost of construction was $4.82/m ($1.47/ft) based on machine and operator costs of $200 (US)/hr for a weighted average cost of $541/ha ($219/ac). Fence installation can cost 3-4 times as much as slash wall construction, plus additional costs for maintenance and removal. The cost to monitor and maintain slash walls was negligible. Slash wall heights slumped approximately 8-14% per year, which reduced slash wall height by 37 cm per year. Four years after creating the slash walls, the heights of tagged seedlings of palatable species remained significantly greater inside the slash wall where deer were excluded than in adjacent control areas that were accessible to deer. We recommend slash walls minimally be constructed 3.1 m tall to the highest 5-cm-diameter branch, 7 m wide at the base, and sufficiently dense to prevent deer from being able to crawl through. This study is the first documentation of slash walls as a feasible and effective technique during regeneration harvesting to exclude deer from impacting forest vegetation. Subsequent to this study, multiple logging crews have created additional slash walls in CT, MA, NH, NY, and RI as part of commercial harvests.

AB  - Kangaroo populations have increased significantly across Australia's arid rangelands where the Dingo (Canis dingo) is excluded, with some of the highest concentrations in western New South Wales. Novel adaptive management tools are needed to conserve kangaroo (Macropus and Osphranter spp.) populations and avoid negative impacts to biodiversity, agricultural production and animal welfare associated with their overabundance. Kangaroo densities within the Wild Deserts ecosystem restoration project within Sturt National Park in western New South Wales exceeded 100/km(2) in mid-2016, during an 18-year regional population high. Following mass population declines attributed to emigration, an estimated 7,700 (+/- 2,100 SE) kangaroos died within the 350-km(2) Wild Deserts site over an 8-month period during drought (December 2017-August 2018). Population trends recorded at Wild Deserts were similar to population declines recorded during annual aerial survey counts across western New South Wales over the same period. With New South Wales (NSW) National Parks and Wildlife Service, Wild Deserts developed a kangaroo management plan to avoid future catastrophic mortality from starvation and mitigate associated ecosystem impacts. Conservation management centred upon a 104-km(2) Adaptive Management Zone, fenced to trial adaptive management of sustainable kangaroo populations and restore habitats for the reintroduction of locally extinct mammals. Kangaroos were removed from two 20-km(2) exclosures, adjacent to the Adaptive Management Zone, to provide baselines against which kangaroo populations could be assessed under variable environmental conditions. To effect this management, we assessed the effectiveness of one-way weldmesh spear and flap gates to provide passive unidirectional movement through fences. Of 171 approaches by adult Red Kangaroos to spear gates, 57 resulted in successful exits, while none of 51 approaches resulted in return movements, supporting the utility of spear gates as a practical and effective tool for directional exits of kangaroos through fences.

AB  - Ongoing declines in the imperiled New England cottontail Sylvilagus transitionalis have coincided with the introduction and expansion of the closely related eastern cottontail Sylvilagus floridanus. These paired population trends have led to the inference of competition between the two species. Competition between native and introduced species has often involved overlapping use of food resources, but limited effort has been spent to analyze the diets of New England cottontail and eastern cottontail and to evaluate the potential for resource competition. We used microhistologic analysis of fecal pellets to assess the winter diets of both species and we compared diet composition with available plant communities to evaluate their preferences for dietary items across southern New England and southeastern New York. We found no differences in diets between New England cottontail and eastern cottontail, although diets did differ between regions within the study area. Diet preferences also were consistent between the species and largely excluded nonnative plant genera. Our results demonstrate that these species are generalist herbivores and that there is high potential for competition for food resources in the winter between them, although the present lack of diet partitioning may indicate the presence of other factors limiting competition. This study highlights the need for careful evaluation of interactions between native and nonnative species, a prerequisite for developing conservation plans that appropriately account for interspecific competition.

AB  - The Kerguelen Plateau is the largest topographic barrier to the eastward flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean. The plateau is separated into a northern and southern plateau by the Fawn Trough. The northern plateau has a shallow bathymetry (<700 m) with two prominent island systems, the Kerguelen Islands on the northern end and Heard and McDonald Islands on the southern end. The interaction of the northern and southern branches of the Polar Front with the northern plateau results in a complex oceanographic environment, with potential for dynamic mixing of sub-Antarctic and Antarctic fauna. Furthermore, the High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) water that flows over the northern plateau is subject to natural iron fertilization from the shallow bathymetry (< 700 m), leading to extensive phytoplankton blooms each summer, particularly to the southeast of the Kerguelen Islands. The Heard Island region on the central plateau has been relatively underexplored. In January 2004, the Heard Island Predator-Prey Investigation and Ecosystem Study (HIPPIES) conducted macrozooplankton (RMT-8 trawl) and micronekton (IYGPT trawl) sampling in foraging areas used by top predators in the vicinity of the island. Macrozooplankton and micronekton were sampled day and night from three depth strata (0-100 m, 100-300 m and 300-600 m). In the area south and east of Heard Island, over bathymetry >= 1000 m depth, the water column had characteristics of the southern branch of the Polar Front (S-PF) and the macrozooplankton and micronekton were dominated by Antarctic Zone fauna (e.g., the euphausiids Euphausia triacantha and Euphausia frigida, and the myctophids Krefftichthys anderssoni, Electrona antarctica, Gymnoscopelus braueri and Gymnoscopelus nicholsi). Shallow slope and shelf stations were located north of the S-PF and the macrozooplankton assemblages were influenced by Polar Frontal Zone species (e.g., Euphausia vallentini), while the shelf micronekton were dominated by the bentho-pelagic channichthyids Champsocephalus gunnari and Channichthys rhinoceratus, together with G. nicholsi. Most macrozooplankton migrated from the deep epipelagic (100-300 m) into the surface epipelagic (<100 m) at night, although some macrozooplankton occurred at high densities in the surface epipelagic during the day (e.g., Rhincalanus gigas, Themisto gaudichaudii). Most micronekton species occurred in the mesopelagic layers (300-600 m) during the day, and migrated into the deep and surface epipelagic at night. Only the small but very abundant K. anderssoni utilized the top 300 m during the day. The vertical distributions of macrozooplankton and micronekton are discussed with respect to the foraging behavior and diets of top predators.

AB  - The growing population of free-roaming horses (Equus ferus caballus) on western public rangelands has necessitated that federal agencies, such as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service, develop novel approaches to curb growth including reproduction management. However, bureaucracy has hindered effective research and application of horse management on public lands and examples on private lands may present new solutions. Here we present the history and current population management strategy for the Wild Horse Ranch (WHR) located in southeastern Wyoming, USA, as an example of an ongoing private entity managing horses. Prior to 1985, this similar to 6,000-ha ranch was used historically for domestic sheep (Ovis aries) production, and after 1985, for yearling cattle (Bos taurus). In 2005, geldings (i.e., castrated males) and mares were purchased from BLM by WHR and introduced to the ranch in conjunction with the development of home sites. In 2019, landowners formed the Wild Horse Preservation Society (WHPS) to enhance horse management and care. The WHPS uses multiple approaches to manage population growth including castrating stallions and treating mares with chemical contraception through partnerships with veterinarians and other stakeholders. In addition, WHPS feeds supplemental hay to horses in severe winter months, provides water during the summer, monitors rangeland vegetation, horse diets, and cares for abandoned foals or geriatric horses. The WHPS is a network of board members and landowners that is working for the betterment of horse welfare and rangeland health and is situated to be a leading entity and example in the area of freeenterprise free-roaming horse reproduction management.

AB  - Despite the ongoing collapse of native mammal populations across northern Australia, the paucity of robust estimates of population density limits our capacity to identify and understand population change. Here we aimed to provide the first estimates of native mammal density on the Tiwi Islands one of Australia's largest remaining refuge areas for native mammals. We conducted intensive live-trapping at four sites that represent varying combinations of fire frequency, feral cat density and feral herbivore presence. We used spatially-explicit capture-recapture models to investigate the density of common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) and northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus). Compared with mainland northern Australia, populations of common brushtail possum and northern brown bandicoot have remained relatively healthy on the Tiwi Islands. Common brushtail possum density was significantly higher on Bathurst Island (1.06 possum ha(-1)) compared with Melville Island (0.32 possum ha(-1)), whereas northern brown bandicoot density varied across all four sites (ranging from 0.04 to 0.34 bandicoot ha(-1)). Unexpectedly, the very frequently burnt Ranku site (Bathurst Island) continues to support healthy populations of both species. These density estimates provide critical information for identifying and understanding future population change for two species that have suffered marked declines across the Australian monsoon tropics. Although the lack of replication limits our ability to draw conclusions regarding the ecological constraints of these mammal populations, our density observations align with a recent conceptual model postulating that the persistence of native mammal populations across northern Australian savannas reflects a complex, but spatially-variable interplay of 'bottom-up' and 'top-down' processes.

AB  - Dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) is rapidly expanding for the dietary estimation of extinct animals. There has been an extensive accumulation of microwear texture data from herbivorous mammals, especially for ruminant artiodactyls, but suids are still underrepresented. Microwear varies depending on the diet, and suids are naturally more flexible than other artiodactyls. Thus, their microwear is prone to greater variability. In this study, we examine the tooth microwear texture of wild boars from Toyama Prefecture, Japan, for which detailed ecological and dietary information by stomach content analysis is available. We first investigated 205 individuals of wild-shot Toyama boars with known sex, age class, localities (the eastern high latitude region vs. the western low latitude region), and season of collection. The tooth surfaces of boarlets were rougher than those of juvenile and adult animals. The decrease in surface roughness with age implied that the frequency of tooth-tooth contact, which seemed to result in cracking of enamels and thus rough surfaces, decreased after the boars started feeding on solid foods (food-tooth contact), with progressive involvement of rooting behavior in mature adults. We further found that surface roughness showed significant differences between localities, with the western Toyama boars having flatter surfaces, possibly because they were involved in more rooting and feeding on soil-contaminated rhizomes than the eastern ones, as implied by the available stomach content data. The frequency of rooting was also evident in the broader comparison among Japanese boar populations with different habitat environments. The mainland boars inhabiting deciduous broad-leaved forests had a flatter and less rough tooth surfaces than those in the subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests of the southern islands. This corresponds to the fact that above-ground dietary resources were more abundant in the habitat of the southern island boars, where crops like succulent vegetables and fruits, as well as naturally fallen acorns, were abundant, whereas underground plant parts were the dominant diet component for the mainland boars. This study proved that DMTA can identify the difference in foraging modes in suids and make it possible to estimate the frequency of rooting, which is informative for inferring breeding methods of boars/pigs from archaeological sites.

AB  - Context. Regeneration Regeneration from seed and resprouting are life-history strategies used by plants in fire- prone landscapes; however, for some species there is a limited understanding of how different factors influence post-fire response within populations. Aims. We studied the effect of inter-fire interval and degree of tree burn on post-fire seedling germination and basal resprouting in Allocasuarina verticillata within two conservation parks on Kangaroo Island. Methods. We undertook seedling counts using 1 m(2) quadrats. Burnt trees were assessed for signs of resprouting. Key results. Seedling density 8-9 months post-fire was primarily influenced by interfire interval, and was higher in stands with an inter-fire interval time of 37-45 years (143 per m(2)) compared to those with an interval of >60 years (48 per m(2)). Resprouting in burnt A. verticillata trees was influenced by the degree of tree burn, but also varied considerably between the two parks. Conclusions. Our study confirmed that A. verticillata is a facultative seeder/resprouter that can regenerate from both seedling germination and resprouting post-fire. However, the two strategies are influenced by different factors, and resprouting rates in A. verticillata can be very low in some circumstances.

AB  - Semi-arid forests need cost-effective restoration strategies to address their severe degradation. Tree shelters are often used to minimize abiotic and biotic stress during seedling establishment. We asked if early-successional weeds act as a natural shelter by facilitating native seedlings, contingent on abiotic and biotic stressors and seedling ecological strategy. We conducted a manipulative weed exclusion experiment at a semi-arid site in South Texas targeted for large-scale forest restoration to discern the net effect of weeds on the growth and survival of target thornscrub tree and shrub seedlings. We assessed the roles of contrasting seedling ecological strategies (fast vs. slow growth habit), temporal variation in abiotic stress, microclimate and mammalian herbivory in modulating weed-seedling interactions. Ungulate herbivory on seedlings was common, of similar frequency across most species, but not diminished by the presence of weed neighbours. On average, seedlings growing adjacent to weed neighbours experienced modest but non-significant increases in both height and mortality after 6 months, relative to weed-excluded areas. However, seedlings without significant herbivory and adjacent to weed neighbours grew more vigorously (increased height and branching) during hot and dry periods, particularly those species with a fast growth habit. Although seedling light-saturated photosynthetic capacity (A(sat)) and air temperature were unaffected by weed presence during hot and dry periods, afternoon light levels were reduced by approximately 50%, possibly indicative of lower leaf temperatures and improved seedling water status. Our results show that realizing the facilitative potential of weeds in semi-arid forest restoration requires minimizing mammalian herbivory and temporally separating competition for resources. Managing for intermediate but not excessive levels of forb canopy cover is likely required to reduce high radiation loads and reduce transpiration without adverse competitive effects. Longer-term experiments manipulating cover crop identity, cover and mammalian herbivory will inform whether forbs can be effectively exploited to enhance restoration success at large scales.

AB  - Characterizing the dietary niche partitioning of sympatric mesocarnivores is fundamental for understanding their mechanisms of coexistence and ecosystem function. By utilizing scat DNA and DNA metabarcoding, our study revealed a detailed picture of the trophic interaction between two mesocarnivores in a cool temperate forest ecosystem in Northeast China. Both red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis) consumed a diverse range of prey (52 prey taxa from 11 orders) dominated by Rodentia (56.5-64.9%). Bipartite trophic network analysis suggested that both predators are generalists and have a high degree of niche overlap (Pianka's index = 0.77). However, diet patterns differed between the predators. Both predators consumed more diverse prey during the snow-free period than during the snow-covered period, which resulted in lower niche overlap between the predators (Pianka's index = 0.43). Another important source of diet niche partitioning was the proportion of large prey consumed, with red foxes consuming more ungulates than leopard cats do throughout the year in regions with two apex carnivores, tigers (Panthera tigris) and leopards (P. pardus). The presence of apex carnivores provides more stable carrion resources, which facilitates dietary niche partitioning and the coexistence of mesocarnivores. Our study provides important clues about the strategies of dietary niche partitioning between sympatric mesocarnivores, which is critical for understanding coexistence within carnivore communities.

Of the 49 cheilostome species reported, 15 are new to science: Beania pauciserialis sp. nov., Caberea rylandi sp. nov., Micropora acorecia sp. nov., Cellaria acorensidolisi sp. nov., Hippothoa jakobseni sp. nov., Chorizopora lula sp. nov., Haplopoma freiwaldi sp. nov., Schizomavella (Schizomavella) reverteri sp. nov., Schizomavella (Schizomavella) kekrymmena sp. nov., Microporella avilai sp. nov., Microporella quadrispinosa sp. nov., Microporella lobopodia sp. nov., Microporella nodulifera sp. nov., Buffonellaria faialensis sp. nov., and Omalosecosa secunda sp. nov. The subspecies Glabrilaria orientalis azorensis (Harmelin, 1988) is here raised to species rank, resulting in Glabrilaria azorensis (Harmelin, 1988) comb. nov. Moreover, we designate a lectotype for Nimba praetexta Jullien in by Jullien & Calvet, 1903, type species of the genus Nimba Jullien in by Jullien & Calvet, 1903, redescribe the species based on scanning electron microscope inspection, and transfer the genus from the Lacernidae Jullien, 1888 to the Escharinidae Tilbrook, 2006. A lectotype is also designated for Schizobrachiella sanguinea (Norman, 1868). Based on the taxonomic account, we discuss changes concerning the recorded diversity of bryozoans in the Azores and their taxonomic assignment, now including 91 endemic species that account for 41% of a total of 221 bryozoan species reported from the archipelago. Finally, we discuss biogeographic relationships and the status of origin, including potential non-indigenous species, and demonstrate a strong relatedness with eastern Atlantic/Mediterranean faunas.

AB  - Indigenous pig breeds are mainly associated with the adaptive capacity that is necessary to respond adequately to climate change, food security, and livelihood needs, and natural resources conservation. Livni pigs are an indigenous fat-type breed farmed in a single farm in the Orel region and located in the Central European part of the Russian Federation. To determine the genomic regions and genes that are affected by artificial selection, we conducted the comparative study of two pig breeds with different breeding histories and breeding objectives, i.e., the native fat-type Livni and meat-type Duroc breeds using the Porcine GGP HD BeadChip, which contains similar to 80,000 SNPs. To check the Livni pigs for possible admixture, the Landrace and the Large White breeds were included into the study of genetic diversity as these breeds participated in the formation of the Livni pigs. We observed the highest level of genetic diversity in Livni pigs compared to commercial breeds (H-U(E) = 0.409 vs. 0.319-0.359, p < 0.001; A(R) = 1.995 vs. 1.894-1.964, p < 0.001). A slight excess of heterozygotes was found in all of the breeds. We identified 291 candidate genes, which were localized within the regions under putative selection, including 22 and 228 genes, which were specific for Livni and Duroc breeds, respectively, and 41 genes common for both breeds. A detailed analysis of the molecular functions identified the genes, which were related to the formation of meat and fat traits, and adaptation to environmental stress, including extreme temperatures, which were different between breeds. Our research results are useful for conservation and sustainable breeding of Livni breed, which shows a high level of genetic diversity. This makes Livni one of the valuable national pig genetic resources.

AB  - The combination of snake-proof barriers and an aerial toxicant-delivery system for snake suppression may allow large-scale control of invasive brown treesnakes (Boiga irregularis) on Guam. However, suppression or local eradication of several other species (e.g., introduced ungulates, cats, rodents) may be required for successful restoration and recovery of forest habitat and reintroduction of native fauna. Island-wide eradication of invasive species is unlikely on Guam, and existing snake-proof barriers are largely ineffective against cats, rodents, shrews, or monitor lizards. Improved barrier technology and pest-control tools may together provide a viable solution to support localized restoration of species and habitats. We designed and tested prototype multispecies barriers using materials known to repel ungulates, cats, and rodents, with a focus on testing the ability of a rolled hood installed over three different mesh designs to repel brown treesnakes and black rats (Rattus rattus). Woven wire (4.9 x 12 mm aperture, 2.5 mm dia. wire) repelled 99.1% of all snakes, including >= 1031 breach attempts by 106 individuals and 2 successful breaches by 1 small individual. Woven wire (6 x 6 mm aperture, 2.7 mm dia. wire) repelled 100% of all snakes, including 611 breach attempts by 65 individuals. Mini chain link mesh (7 x 9 mm aperture, 1 mm dia. wire) repelled 100% of all snakes, including 1053 breach attempts by 97 individuals. Brown treesnakes were unable to climb either of the two woven wire designs (1642 breach attempts by 171 individuals), making the rolled hood serve as a redundant secondary snake barrier. The rolled hood repelled 100% of all snakes when individuals were provided a climbable surface to access the hood (94 breach attempts by 39 snakes). The probability of a snake being able to climb the mini chain link mesh was inversely related to snout-vent length. The rolled hood repelled 100% of all rats, with 5080 breach attempts by 21 individuals. Recommended next steps include consultation with engineers to address wind loading, structural integrity, material interactions, and integration of decision-support tools to optimize cost and efficacy of barrier designs on the landscape.

AB  - Net-wire fencing built to confine livestock is common on rangelands in the Southwestern USA, yet the impacts of livestock fencing on wildlife are largely unknown. Many wildlife species cross beneath fences at defined crossing locations because they prefer to crawl underneath rather than jump over fences. Animals occasionally become entangled jumping or climbing over fences, leading to injury or death. More commonly, repeated crossings under net-wire fencing by large animals lead to fence damage, though the damage is often tolerated by landowners until the openings affect the ability to enclose livestock. The usage, placement, characteristics, and passage rates of fence crossings beneath net-wire fencing are poorly understood. We monitored 20 randomly selected fence crossings on net-wire livestock fencing across two study sites on rangelands in South Texas, USA, from April 2018 to March 2019. We assessed the characteristics of fence-crossing locations (openings beneath the fence created by animals to aid in crossing) and quantified crossing rates and the probability of crossing by all species of animals via trail cameras. We documented 10,889 attempted crossing events, with 58% (n = 6271) successful. Overall, 15 species of medium- and large-size mammals and turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) contributed to crossing events. Crossing locations received 3-4 crossing attempts per day on average, but the number of attempts and probability of successful crossing varied by location and fence condition. The probability of crossing attempts was most consistently influenced by the opening size of the crossing and season; as crossing size (opening) increased, the probability of successful crossing significantly increased for all species. Peaks in crossing activity corresponded with species' daily and seasonal movements and activity. The density and size of fence-crossing locations were dependent on fence maintenance and not associated with vegetation communities or habitat variables. However, crossing locations were often re-established in the same locations after fence repairs. This is one of the few studies to monitor how all animal species present interacted with net-wire livestock fencing in rangelands. Our results will help land managers understand the impact of net-wire livestock fencing on animal movement.

AB  - Biological invasions, as a result of human intervention through trade and mobility, are the second biggest cause of biodiversity loss. The impacts of invasive alien species (IAS) on the environment are well known, however, economic impacts are poorly estimated, especially in mega-diverse countries where both economic and ecological consequences of these effects can be catastrophic. Ecuador, one of the smallest mega-diverse countries, lacks a comprehensive description of the economic costs of IAS within its territory. Here, using "InvaCost", a public database that compiles all recorded monetary costs associated with IAS from English and Non-English sources, we investigated the economic costs of biological invasions. We found that between 1983 and 2017, the reported costs associated with biological invasions ranged between US$86.17 million (when considering only the most robust data) and US$626 million (when including all cost data) belonging to 37 species and 27 genera. Furthermore, 99% of the recorded cost entries were from the Galapagos Islands. From only robust data, the costliest identified taxonomic group was feral goats (Capra hircus; US$20 million), followed byAedes mosquitoes (US$2.14 million) while organisms like plant species from the genus Rubus, a parasitic fly (Philornis downsi), black rats (Rattus rattus) and terrestrial gastropods (Achatina fulica) represented less than US$2 million each. Costs of "mixed-taxa" (i.e. plants and animals) represented the highest (61% of total robust costs; US$52.44 million). The most impacted activity sector was the national park authorities, which spent about US$84 million. Results from robust data also revealed that management expenditures were the major type of costs recorded in the Galapagos Islands; however, costs reported for medical losses related to Aedes mosquitoes causing dengue fever in mainland Ecuador would have ranked first if more detailed information had allowed us to categorize them as robust data. Over 70% of the IAS reported for Ecuador did not have reported costs. These results suggest that costs reported here are a massive underestimate of the actual economic toll of invasions in the country.

AB  - Loss to cultivated crops by wild pigs (Sus scrofa) is widespread and can jeopardize low-income farmers. In India, although there is lot of political interest in the problem, efforts to understand the patterns, correlates, and underlying reasons for wild pig conflict continue to be minimal. We quantified loss of wheat (Triticum aestivum) to wild pigs and assessed the spatial patterns of damage in a forest settlement of Van Gujjar (Haridwar, India), which is a dairy-based pastoralist community. We chose a 4-km(2) cultivated area comprising 400 farmlands (each measuring 0.8 ha and belonging to a family) and assessed crop damage by wild pigs through field surveys during the harvest season. We interviewed 159 respondents who manage 219 of the total 400 farmlands in the study area to compare actual crop loss with perceived losses. Wild pigs damaged 2.29 tonnes (2,290 kg) of wheat, which was about 2.6% of the potential yield in the study area. A total of 39 farmlands (9.5%), managed by 28 respondents, suffered losses during the survey period at an average loss of about 58.8 kg (SD +/- 89.5, range = 0.7-388 kg). During interviews, 81 respondents managing 155 farmlands (70.7%) reported having suffered wild pig-related crop loss during the survey period. They also perceived losing about 23.4% of the potential yield of wheat due to wild pigs. The perceived losses were much higher than actual losses. Actual losses measured through field surveys underscore the dichotomy between actual and perceived crop loss due to wild pigs. About 81% of recorded wild pig-related damage to wheat occurred within 200 m from the forest edge. The crop protection measures aimed at stopping wild pigs from entering the fields were mostly reactive. Although overall crop losses due to wild pigs seem low at the settlement level, for affected individual families, the losses were financially significant. Such recurrent crop losses can cause families to go into debt, trigger animosity toward conservation, and lead to retaliation measures, which may be indiscriminate and have the potential to affect other endangered mammals in conservation priority landscapes. Because crop losses by wild pigs are severe along the narrow band of fields along the edge of the forest, channeling monetary benefits through insurance-based compensation schemes can help assuage losses to farmers. Further, because crop damage by wild pigs is seasonal, experimenting with mobile fences that can be dismantled and packed away after use would be beneficial.

AB  - We examined dietary preferences of wild pigs to discern possible bait alternatives to corn. Captive trials were conducted during spring and fall 2021 in the Wild Pig Research Facility at Kerr Wildlife Management Area, Hunt, Texas, USA. We conducted 2-choice tests by allowing wild pigs to feed ad libitum on soybeans, split peas, mealworms, and peanuts (spring 2021), and oats, acorns, earthworms, and peanuts (fall 2021), always with corn available as a second choice for reference. In each trial, we used proportion of test bait eaten versus total bait eaten, and relative access to both food sources as indices of bait preference. We found that a higher proportion of corn was consumed than that of any test bait in the spring, but not in the fall. However, we found that earthworms were consumed more than any other test bait in the fall. We also found that corn was accessed more than test baits in the spring, but not more than earthworms or peanuts in the fall. Greater consumption of earthworms relative to other baits, and access rates comparable to corn indicated that earthworms could be an effective alternative bait to corn. Our work suggests that alternative baits may be equally or more effective for attracting wild pigs than corn.

AB  - IntroductionBurrowing activities of plateau pikas cause widespread bare patches in alpine meadows on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, affecting the plant community composition and forage production. However, it is not clear how these bare patches influence the main forage composition in alpine meadows. MethodsTherefore, we investigated the plant communities in bare patches (BP) and neighboring control plots (CK) in alpine meadows in Maqu county in the Gannan region of China. ResultsOur results showed that plant communities in the CK plots differed from those in the BP plots. The sedge cover, number of sedge species and number of grass species were all significantly higher in the CK plots compared to the BP plots. However, grass cover and its dry weight were significantly higher in the BP plots. Grass cover and the grass dry weight in the BP plots were 1.859 times and 1.802 times higher than that in the CK plots across the five sites, respectively. Grasses also had a significantly higher cover and dry weight than sedge in the BP plots, grass cover was 66.5 times higher than the sedge cover, and the grass dry weight was 68.242 times that of the sedge dry weight. Therefore, bare patches resulting from plateau pika burrowing activity significantly increase the grass/sedge ratio in alpine meadows. DiscussionA potential explanation is that grasses have a stronger reproductive potential than sedges in bare soil. This has implications for pasture yields since grasses have a higher biomass per unit area compared to sedges in alpine meadows.

AB  - A survey of the Pearl Island archipelago discovered a Preceramic shell-bearing midden on the island of Pedro Gonz?alez located in Panama Bay in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. This occupation dates between ca. 6200 and 5600 cal yr BP, and revealed a mixed marine and terrestrial economy including the exploitation of sea and terrestrial turtles, snakes, iguanas, dolphins, and land mammals such as dwarf deer. Test excavations in 2007?2010 provided well-preserved invertebrate and vertebrate samples, which were considerably more diverse taxonomically for fish than for other vertebrate categories. At that time, only boa among a large snake sample was identified to species. A 7 ? 4 m pit dug in 2015 increased the faunal sample but added little to diversity. Development of the ophidian comparative collection, augmented by on-line research, enhanced snake diversity and highlighted the dietary importance of snakes. Two marine turtle species ? hawksbill and Pacific green? remain the only ones exploited. Improvements in stratigraphic sectioning have fine-tuned chronological fluctuations of faunal populations as in the case of green iguana and terrestrial mammals. Birds have experienced the greatest increase in diversity, but not as much as expected on the basis of the present-day island avifauna. Only two terrestrial mammal genera ? squirrel, and rabbit ? were added to the inventory inferred during 2007?2010, which comprised deer, opossum, monkey, agouti, paca, spiny rat, furry spiny rat, and probable capybara. The occupants of Pedro Gonz?alez took advantage of the abundant agate nodules eroding from the island?s volcanic bedrock. This latest study reveals the presence of a substantial microlithic component that relied on the specialized heat treatment of whole nodules of lithic raw materials. As an idea to be explored further, we suggest that these microliths may have been produced by women for the manufacture and maintenance of composite cutting and/or grating tools used for the preparation of various foods. Ongoing analyses from the 2015 excavations are providing new information on the impact of these early colonists on the local fauna and have demonstrated how the physical properties of the island?s lithic raw materials influenced their reduction strategies.

AB  - Tokashiki Island with convenient access from urban areas and blessed with rich marine resources, attracts numerous tourists seeking recreational activities such as diving and snorkeling. The island heavily relies on a tourism industry centered on marine resources. However, with the escape and rapid increase in the population of Japanese boars, which were initially introduced as livestock, various damages have become evident. Particularly in recent years, a major concern for local tourism industry stakeholders has been the predation of sea turtle eggs by boars because sea turtles are highly popular marine creatures among snorkelers and divers. Identifying the locations of sea turtle egg predation by wild boars and examining the conditions and situations that increase the likelihood of damage are crucial tasks in considering measures to mitigate the impact. Therefore, in this study, we analyze the factors influencing egg predation using a two-variable logistic regression model. The damage site data from on-site surveys conducted during the 2023 nesting season were utilized along with topographical, land-use, and vegetation data. Explanatory variables included in the regression analysis are average slope angle around the damage sites, predominant vegetation around the damage sites, distance to buildings, distance to roads, distance to rivers, and width of the sandy beach. Results from the regression analysis revealed that the predominant vegetation surrounding the damage sites and the width of the sandy beach significantly influence the risk of damage. Despite encountering challenges during the regression analysis, such as utilizing data from a single year's nesting season, relatively coarse geographical information, and limited explanatory variables, future endeavors should focus on collecting and accumulating more data for a more comprehensive analysis. Nevertheless, this analysis underscores the value of information provided by such studies in establishing spatial priorities for implementing measures to capture wild boars and protect sea turtle eggs in the future.

AB  - Reintroducing apex predators is an important approach in ecosystem restoration; however, it is challenging. Wolves (Canis lupus) were exterminated in Japan around 1900, and since then, there has been a lack of top predators throughout the country. Currently, the wild ungulate population is increasing, causing agricultural and forest damage. This has triggered an ongoing debate among researchers and nongovernmental organizations on whether wolves should be reintroduced to promote self-regulating biodiverse ecosystems. We conducted a nationwide survey to examine public attitudes toward wolf reintroduction (WR) in Japan. We sent online questionnaires to 88,318 citizens across the country. Among the 12,028 respondents, excluding those with invalid or incomplete answers and unqualified respondents, we obtained and analyzed 7500 responses that were representative of Japanese citizens in terms of some key sociodemographic attributes. More respondents disagreed with WR (39.9%) than agreed (17.1%), and many respondents (43.0%) were undecided. Structural equation modeling revealed that risk perceptions affected public attitudes, implying that the greater the perceived threat of wolf attacks, the less likely people are to support WR. In contrast, attitudes toward wolves (e.g., "I like wolves.") influenced by wildlife value orientation and beliefs about the ecological role of wolves (e.g., controlling deer populations) positively affected public attitudes toward WR. Those who had a positive attitude toward WR showed intentions to engage in behaviors that support WR. Our results suggest that the dissemination of information related to the ecological role of wolves and the development of a more mutualistic mindset in people could positively influence public support for WR in Japan.

AB  - Sponges are ecologically important benthic organisms with many important functional roles. However, despite increasing global interest in the functions that sponges perform, there has been limited focus on how such functions will be impacted by different anthropogenic stressors. In this review, we describe the progress that has been made in our understanding of the functional roles of sponges over the last 15 years and consider the impacts of anthropogenic stressors on these roles. We split sponge functional roles into interactions with the water column and associations with other organisms. We found evidence for an increasing focus on functional roles among sponge-focused research articles, with our understanding of sponge-mediated nutrient cycling increasing substantially in recent years. From the information available, many anthropogenic stressors have the potential to negatively impact sponge pumping, and therefore have the potential to cause ecosystem level impacts. While our understanding of the importance of sponges has increased in the last 15 years, much more experimental work is required to fully understand how sponges will contribute to reef ecosystem function in future changing oceans.

AB  - The rapid expansion of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) throughout the United States has been fueled by unlawful introductions, with invasive populations causing extensive crop losses, damaging native ecosystems, and serving as a reservoir for disease. Multiple states have passed laws prohibiting the possession or transport of wild pigs. However, genetic and phenotypic similarities between domestic pigs and invasive wild pigs-which overwhelmingly represent domestic pig and wild boar hybrids-pose a challenge for the enforcement of such regulations. We sought to exploit wild boar ancestry as a common attribute among the vast majority of invasive wild pigs as a means of genetically differentiating wild pigs from breeds of domestic pig found within the United States. We organized reference high-density single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes (1039 samples from 33 domestic breeds and 382 samples from 16 wild boar populations) into five genetically cohesive reference groups: mixed-commercial breeds, Durocs, heritage breeds, primitive breeds, and wild boar. Building upon well-established genetic clustering approaches, we structured the test statistic to describe the difference in the likelihood of a given genotype's ancestry vectors (sensu genetic clustering analysis) if derived strictly from the four described domestic pig reference groups versus allowing for admixture from the wild boar group. By fitting statistical distributions to test statistics of reference domestic pigs, we characterized the distribution of the null hypothesis that a given genotype descends strictly from domestic pig reference groups. We tested the approach with simulated genotypes and empirical data from an additional 29 breeds of domestic pig represented by 435 unique genotypes; all associated test statistics for simulated and empirical domestic pig challenge sets fell within the distribution of reference domestic pigs. We then evaluated 6566 invasive wild pigs sampled across the contiguous United States, of which 63% exceeded the maximum threshold for domestic pigs and could be statistically classified as possessing wild boar ancestry. This approach provides a scientific foundation to enforce regulations prohibiting the possession of this destructive invasive species. Further, this computationally efficient and generalizable approach could be readily adapted to quantify gene flow among ecological systems of conservation or management concern.

AB  - Megafauna are important seed dispersers because they can disperse large quantities of seeds over long distances. In Hokkaido, Japan, the largest terrestrial animal is the brown bear (Ursus arctos) and other megafauna seed dispersers are lacking. Thus, brown bears are expected to have an important function as seed dispersers in Hokkaido. In this study, we, for the first time, evaluated the seed dispersal function of brown bears in Hokkaido using three fleshy-fruited trees and studied: (1) gut passage time (GPT) in feeding experiments, (2) seed dispersal distance using tracking data of wild bears, and (3) the effect of gut passage and pulp removal on germination rate. Most seeds were defecated intact, and less than 6% were broken. The average GPT without pulp was 3 h and 56 min to 6 h and 13 min, depending on the plant and trial. Each plant's average simulated seed dispersal distance was 202-512 m. The dispersal distance of Actinidia arguta seeds with pulp was significantly longer than those without pulp because of their longer GPT. The germination rate of defecated seeds without pulp was 19-51%, depending on the plant, and was significantly higher or not different comparing with that of seeds with pulp. We concluded that brown bears in Hokkaido are effective seed dispersers. In managing brown bears in Hokkaido, such ecological functions should be considered along with conserving the bear population and reducing human-bear conflicts.

AB  - The Teuchitlan River in Mexico is a hotspot of fish diversity, with 3 endemic species. Pseudoxiphophorus bimaculatus has been introduced into the river, but its trophic impact on the system is unknown. We determined the importance of each food item in the diet of P. bimaculatus with a relative importance index, their feeding behavior using an omnivorous index, the trophic position with the TrophLab program, and the niche breadth using the standardized Levin index. We performed Permanova analyses to compare diet between size classes, sites, and seasons. We analyzed 631 P. bimaculatus individuals. The species consumed mainly terrestrial insects, but presented an herbivorous trend in some sites. A generalist trophic behavior was presented in the wet season and a specialist behavior in the dry season occupying different trophic levels and presenting variable trophic width. This flexible feeding strategy enables P. bimaculatus to exploit resources from different trophic levels. The high consumption (%RII > 50) of terrestrial insects could indicate that P. bimaculatus may transport allochthonous energy into the river. Furthermore, the high invasive potential of the species represents a risk for the freshwater ecosystems of central Mexico, a region that has been recognized as a hotspot for freshwater fish conservation.

AB  - 1.Visibility (viewshed) plays a significant and diverse role in animals' behaviour and fitness. Understanding how visibility influences animal behaviour requires the measurement of habitat visibility at spatial scales commensurate to individual animal choices. However, measuring habitat visibility at a fine spatial scale over a landscape is a challenge, particularly in highly heterogeneous landscapes (e.g. forests). As a result, our ability to model the influence of fine-scale visibility on animal behaviour has been impeded or limited. 2.In this study, we demonstrate the application of the concept of three-dimensional (3D) cumulative viewshed in the study of animal spatial behaviour at a landscape level. Specifically, we employed a newly described approach that combines terrestrial and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to measure fine-scale habitat visibility (3D cumulative viewshed) on a continuous scale in forested landscapes. We applied the LiDAR-derived visibility to investigate how visibility in forests affects the summer habitat selection and the movement of 20 GPS-collared female red deer Cervus elaphus in a temperate forest in Germany. We used integrated step selection analysis to determine whether red deer show any preference for fine-scale habitat visibility and whether visibility is related to the rate of movement of red deer. 3.We found that red deer selected intermediate habitat visibility. Their preferred level of visibility during the day was substantially lower than that of night and twilight, whereas the preference was not significantly different between night and twilight. In addition, red deer moved faster in high-visibility areas, possibly mainly to avoid predation and anthropogenic risk. Furthermore, red deer moved most rapidly between locations in the twilight. 4.For the first time, the preference for intermediate habitat visibility and the adaption of movement rate to fine-scale visibility by a forest-dwelling ungulate species at a landscape scale was revealed. The LiDAR technique used in this study offers fine-scale habitat visibility at the landscape level in forest ecosystems, which would be of broader interest in the fields of animal ecology and behaviour.

AB  - Specialised natural enemies can locally suppress seeds and seedlings near conspecific adults more than far from them. Whilst this is thought to facilitate species coexistence, the relative contribution of multiple enemies to whether heterospecific seeds and seedlings rather than conspecifics perform better beneath a particular adult species remains less clear, especially in regions with spatially extensive monodominant stands. We designed a field exclusion experiment to separate the effects of fungi, insects and vertebrates on the seedling establishment and early survival of two temperate tree species, Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies, in the adult tree monocultures of these species. Our experiment demonstrates the key role of vertebrates in mediating the effects of adult trees on seeds and seedlings. Due to vertebrates and partly insects, Fagus sylvatica seedlings survived worse beneath conspecific than heterospecific adults and were also outperformed by Picea abies seedlings beneath their own adults. Picea abies seedling establishment was higher beneath conspecific than heterospecific adults, but Fagus sylvatica seedlings outperformed them beneath their own adults. The impact of enemies on Picea abies establishment beneath conspecific adults was less clear. Fungi did not influence seedling establishment and survival. Our findings highlight the need to compare enemy impacts on each seedling species beneath conspecific and heterospecific adults with their impacts on conspecific and heterospecific seedlings beneath a particular adult species. Such evaluations can shed more light on the role of enemies in tree communities by identifying the plant-enemy interactions that facilitate species coexistence and those that promote species monodominance.

AB  - The morphological plasticity of the Sus scrofa wild-domestic species complex is evident in both free-ranging morphotypes and domestic breeds. The Brazilian Pantanal feral hog ("porco-monteiro") evolved after a long-term feralization process and represents a significant proportion of the mammalian biomass in the region. Its coexistence with native fauna brings several ecological impacts, which are mitigated by the Brazilian Pantanal wetland vastness and resource availability. They are a local subsistence game resource but also impact crops and pastures. Around the 2000s to mid-2010s, numerous European wild boar were introduced in Brazil to fulfill a demand for gourmet meat. Wild boar was also introduced to the Brazilian Pantanal as a game species and to breed with porco-monteiro feral hogs in a commercial venture to produce an even more exotic meat. The craze for wild boar meat has since dwindled, but their populations remain widespread and uncontrolled. Moreover, the full impact of the wild boar introduction on feral hog populations is still unknown. This study analyzes the skulls of porco-monteiro feral hogs from the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s to assess possible morphological and functional variations along with skulls of wild boar and hybrids from Argentina, Uruguay, and Southern Brazil. The results indicate a trend of broadening of feral hog skulls at the coronal plane and a progressive reduction of the semispinalis capitis muscle scars over the decades. Biomechanical analysis denoted a decrease in head-elevation force that could affect the rooting performance of the latest feral hog morphotypes. Taken together, results show that wild boars likely influenced the evolution of the Pantanal feral hog skull. The magnitude of ecomorphological implications of these morphofunctional changes is unknown, as well as its effects in the Brazilian Pantanal wetland ecology.
   Pantanal Wetland feral hogs have coexisted with indigenous mammal species for about 175 years in Central Brazil. In the last 20 years, European wild boars were introduced in this region as game species and started to breed with these feral hogs leading to unpredictable morphological and ecological alterations.

AB  - The creation and expansion of protected areas, coupled with wildlife reintroductions, are increasingly used as conservation measures to combat wildlife declines worldwide. Although these types of restoration efforts are expected be beneficial to wildlife populations, variable species management and interactions among species within complex food webs have the potential to lead to unintended species-specific responses to reserve expansion which can counteract the anticipated positive effects. We used a multi-season camera trap study to investigate community-wide responses of wildlife to a reserve expansion and associated wildlife releases in South Africa. We analyzed the camera trap data using community occupancy and N-mixture models to assess how the occupancy and intensity of use of individual species changed in the four seasons following reserve expansion. We found species-specific responses to reserve expansion, although responses were generally positive in occupancy and intensity of use but un-sustained. The apex predator, the lion (Panthera leo) and the majority of managed herbivores exhibited sustained or delayed positive responses, whereas most subordinate predators and unman-aged herbivores had short-lived, fluctuating, or neutral responses. Interactive effects of top-down suppression, competitive pressure, and increased space and food resources likely resulted in the temporally-variable responses of most species. Although no species responded negatively to reserve expansion and mammal reintroductions, the lack of sustained positive responses for most species indicates the complexities of implementing conservation actions to benefit multiple wildlife species. Our results highlight the importance of monitoring the entire wildlife community following management actions such as reserve expansion or wildlife reintroductions.

AB  - Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are designated as Threatened or Endangered in Canada, with many populations being at risk of extirpation. Approaches for caribou conservation can be both invasive and expensive. For example, maternity penning involves the relocation of pregnant females to a predator-free fenced enclosure where they are held for 20-22 weeks. This activity greatly reduces the risk of predation for adult females and their dependent calves, but requires the construction, maintenance, and monitoring of a penning facility as well as the risk associated with the capture and transport of adult caribou. With only four maternity pen trials within the last decade, there has been little study of the potential influence of maternity penning on the distribution and habitat use of caribou after release. We used Brownian Bridge Movement Models to examine changes in range fidelity and overall range use of the Klinse-Za caribou herd in north-central British Columbia, Canada, following eight years of maternity penning. We generated annual home range utilisation distributions and examined the space use of caribou among years and between penned and unpenned animals, as well as pre-penning and post-penning time periods. We found that following penning, caribou shifted distribution to areas near maternity pens and expanded their overall use of range. However, caribou did not shift their distribution relative to the elevation of their mountainous habitats. Our results suggest that caribou can adapt to capture and forced displacement without altering patterns of instinctual or learned habitat use.

AB  - Introduced macroalgae becoming invasive may alter ecological functions and habitats in recipient ecosystems. In the Western Indian Ocean (WIO), non-native strains of the native macroalgae Eucheuma denticulatum were introduced for farming practices and consequently spread into the surrounding seascape. We investigated potential effects of non-native and native strains of this macroalgae on a branching coral. We conducted a four-factor field experiment where we examined growth and holdfast development of introduced and native E. denticulatum on live and dead branches of Acropora sp. in the presence and absence of herbivores in Unguja Island, Zanzibar. Moreover, we estimated coral and macroalgae condition by visual examinations, gene expression analyses, and photosynthetic measurements. Macroalgae did not attach to any live coral and coral condition was not impacted by the presence of E. denticulatum, regardless of geographical origin. Instead, necrotic tissue on the macroalgae in areas of direct contact with corals indicated damage inflicted by the coral. The biomass of E. denticulatum did not differ between the replicates attached to live or dead corals in the experiment, yet biomass was strongly influenced by herbivory and replicates without protection from herbivores had a significantly lower biomass. In the absence of herbivory, introduced E. denticulatum had significantly higher growth rates than native algae based on wet weight measurements. These results contribute to an increased understanding of environmental effects by the farming of a non-native strain of algae on corals and stresses the importance to maintain viable populations of macroalgal feeding fishes in such areas.

AB  - Coexistence of competing species in the same foraging guild has long puzzled ecologists. In particular, how do small subordinate species persist with larger dominant competitors? This question becomes particularly important when conservation interventions, such as reintroduction or translocation, become necessary for the smaller species. Exclusion of dominant competitors might be necessary to establish populations of some endangered species. Ultimately, however, the goal should be to conserve whole communities. Determining how subordinate species escape competitive exclusion in intact communities could inform conservation decisions by clarifying the ecological conditions and processes required for coexistence at local or regional scales. We tested for spatial and temporal partitioning among six species of native, granivorous rodents using null models, and characterized the microhabitat of each species using resource-selection models. We found that the species' nightly activity patterns are aggregated temporally but segregated spatially. As expected, we found clear evidence that the larger-bodied kangaroo rats drive spatial partitioning, but we also found species-specific microhabitat associations, which suggests that habitat heterogeneity is part of what enables these species to coexist. Restoration of natural disturbance regimes that create habitat heterogeneity, and selection of translocation sites without specific competitors, are among the management recommendations to consider in this case. More generally, this study highlights the need for a community-level approach to conservation and the usefulness of basic ecological data for guiding management decisions.

AB  - Increasing soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage can help mitigate climate change and sustain soil fertility. Changes in herbivore and anthropogenic nutrient enrichment intensities can lead to dramatic shifts in the plant and microbial communities, soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient dynamics. However, the legacy effects of grazing and N enrichment on the biogeochemical processes remain unclear. Here, we conducted a 6-year rotational grazing (Stocking rates: 0, 8 and 16 sheep ha-1) and 4-year N-addition (N addition levels: 0, 50, 100 and 200 kg N ha-1 yr-1) experiment to investigate how soil C, N and phosphorus (P) components respond to the legacy effects of grazing and N fertilization after a 3-year cessation of grazing and N addition treatments in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). We show that previous grazing significantly increased soil total nitrogen (STN), slightly increased SOC and decreased soil total phosphorus (STP); while previous N fertilization significantly decreased SOC, but it did not significantly alter STN and STP. Previous grazing at low stocking rates (<= 8 sheep ha-1) might amplify the negative legacy effects of N fertilization on SOC, while a higher stocking rate would weaken the negative impacts of previous N fertilization on SOC. The interactive and synergistic impacts of historical grazing and N fertilization induced a significantly negative effect on STP. Previous N fertilization decreased soil microbial carbon (MBC) and increased soil available N:P, resulting in the reduction of SOC. The increase in plant diversity caused by previous grazing increased SOC, which counteracted the negative effects of increasing bacterial diversity. Previous grazing-induced decreasing bacterial community heterogeneity may lead to increased STN. Although previous grazing-induced increases in soil moisture and soil nutrient availability may have positive effects on STP, previous grazing-induced negative effects on STP may exceed those positive effects. Therefore, the legacy effects of grazing could be beneficial for improving soil C and N, but may increase the risk of soil P loss in the short term, while residual exogenous N could pose a detrimental effect on C storage over time. Reintroducing grazing and/or P addition may be an appropriate choice to offset the adverse consequence of N deposition in the context of global change. Our findings suggest that the stocking rate at about 8 sheep ha-1 could be a suitable grassland management technique for soil fertility sequestration and mitigating the negative influences of residual exogenous N in the QTP.

AB  - Thermal imaging drones have transformed wildlife monitoring by facilitating the efficient and noninvasive monitoring of animal populations across large areas. In this study, an optimized flight path design was developed for monitoring wildlife on Guleopdo Island, South Korea using the DJI Mavic 3T drone equipped with a thermal camera. We employed a strata-based sampling technique to reclassify topographical and land cover information, creating an optimal survey plan. Using sampling strata, key waypoints were derived, on the basis of which nine flight paths were designed to cover similar to 50% of the study area. The results demonstrated that an optimized flight path improved the accuracy of detecting Formosan sika deer (Cervus nippon taiouanus). Population estimates indicated at least 128 Formosan sika deer, with higher detection efficiency observed during cloudy weather. Customizing flight paths based on the habitat characteristics proved crucial for efficient monitoring. This study highlights the potential of thermal imaging drones for accurately estimating wildlife populations and supporting conservation efforts.

AB  - The temporal abundance of Antarctic seals is known to be influenced by variation in the sea ice environment, itself affected by temperature and daylight cycles across seasons. However, the sensitivity of seal populations to changes in their environment beyond expected natural variation depends on their abilities to deal with extreme conditions and to take advantage of favourable environmental changes, which is rarely validated empirically. Here, we report on the responses of three sympatric Antarctic seal species to sea ice change: two 'ice-tolerant' species: Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella and southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina, and the 'ice-obligate' Weddell seal Leptonychotes wedellii, over a 48-year period from 1977 to 2024 at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands. This area has undergone changes in the sea ice environment following persistent long-term warming since the 1950s, and a cooling period from approximately 1998-2014. The shared environment and varying adaptation to sea ice of the three species presented a unique opportunity to assess and compare species-specific responses to fluctuating sea ice cycles, and validate predictions of responses from projections of sea ice change. Across five decades, all three species were significantly affected by temporary changes in the sea-ice environment, which contributed to synchronous between-year variation in numbers, although density dependence was an important effect for each species. Maximum synchrony between seal species was observed from the late 1990s to mid-2000s, coinciding with the temporary absence of warming, with the ice obligate Weddell seal benefiting from an extended sea ice season but not the two ice-tolerant species. Numbers of Antarctic fur seals and Weddell seals declined significantly between 1977 and 2024 by approximately 47% and 54% respectively, from a peak in 1994 and 1985, although no significant overall long-term decline in the numbers of southern elephant seals was found, despite trend synchronicity.

AB  - Population density estimations are essential for wildlife management and conservation. Camera traps have become a promising cost-effective tool, for which several methods have been described to estimate population density when individuals are unrecognizable (i.e. unmarked populations). However, comparative tests of their applicability and performance are scarce.
   Here, we have compared three methods based on camera traps to estimate population density without individual recognition: Random Encounter Model (REM), Random Encounter and Staying Time (REST) and Distance Sampling with camera traps (CT-DS). Comparisons were carried out in terms of consistency with one another, precision and cost-effectiveness. We considered six natural populations with a wide range of densities, and three species with different behavioural traits (red deer Cervus elaphus, wild boar Sus scrofa and red fox Vulpes vulpes). In three of these populations, we obtained independent density estimates as a reference.
   The densities estimated ranged from 0.23 individuals/km(2) (fox) to 34.87 individuals/km(2) (red deer). We did not find significant differences in terms of density values estimated by the three methods in five out of six populations, but REM has a tendency to generate higher average density values than REST and CT-DS. Regarding the independents' densities, REM results were not significantly different in any population, and REST and CT-DS were significantly different in one population. The precision obtained was not significantly different between methods, with average coefficients of variation of 0.28 (REST), 0.36 (REM) and 0.42 (CT-DS). The REST method required the lowest human effort.
   Synthesis and applications. Our results show that all of the methods examined can work well, with each having particular strengths and weaknesses. Broadly, Random Encounter and Staying Time (REST) could be recommended in scenarios of high abundance, Distance Sampling with camera traps (CT-DS) in those of low abundance while Random Encounter Model (REM) can be recommended when camera trap performance is not optimal, as it can be applied with less risk of bias. This broadens the applicability of camera trapping for estimating densities of unmarked populations using information exclusively obtained from camera traps. This strengthens the case for scientifically based camera trapping as a cost-effective method to provide reference estimates for wildlife managers, including within multi-species monitoring programmes.

AB  - The wild boar (Sus scrofa) has emerged as a growing concern for animal and public health due to its role as a reservoir for multiple pathogens, many notifiable to the World Organization for Animal Health, and its high invasive potential. In countries like Argentina, this species poses a persistent threat to the swine industry. The potential introduction of exotic diseases, such as African swine fever, into wild boar populations presents a serious risk to national food security and international trade. The interface between wild boars and domestic pigs represents a critical spatial overlap where disease transmission may occur. Although risk mapping can support surveillance and control efforts, it remains challenging in data-scarce contexts. To address this, we applied expert elicitation within a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework to identify areas at highest risk for wild boar-domestic pig interactions in Argentina. Model validation confirmed its effectiveness in identifying risk zones, with high and medium-risk areas mostly concentrated in C & oacute;rdoba, San Luis, Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, La Pampa, and Entre R & iacute;os provinces. While most of the country exhibited an absence of risk, the identified medium- and high-risk areas warrant targeted mitigation efforts and active surveillance. This study provides a practical tool to guide surveillance strategies and demonstrates a replicable, knowledge-driven modeling approach suitable for data-limited environments.

AB  - Grazing birds like geese can have a big impact on agricultural land, potentially causing damage to crops. Their exploitation of agricultural land varies within and between seasons, and these temporal grazing patterns can be influenced by management. Furthermore, management practices using scaring and accommodation aim to influence local grazing pressures. To achieve efficient goose management we need a good understanding of the effects of timing and intensity of grazing on grass development and subsequent yield loss. We performed an exclosure study on twelve fields in Friesland (Frysla<SIC>n), the Netherlands to study the effect of grazing on grass development and potential yield loss. Grazing was prevented either from November or from early April until farmers anticipated their first harvest. Every two weeks we measured grass height and calculated growth in exclosures and in ungrazed plots, and performed dropping counts. The results show that the difference in grass height between grazed and ungrazed plots increases with grazing pressure, but less so for higher grazing pressures. We also find that both winter and spring grazing can result in a larger difference in grass height between grazed and ungrazed plots, and grazing into the growing season delays the start of grass growth. This appears due to the relationship between grass height and growth rate. Because the optimal height for growth increases over the season, spring grazing has a much larger impact on grassland yields than winter grazing. Overall these results show that the amount of yield loss depends on different aspects of grazing, most prominently the recovery time, duration and grazing intensity. We hypothesize that barnacle geese may select fields with denser swards and may stimulate sward density by frequent grazing throughout winter and early spring as well as across consecutive years. Future studies should look into the effect of harvest delays and sward density on the size and quality of yield across the season and especially at the last cut. Management with scaring and accommodation may be able to reduce overall yield losses, but the effect may depend on the timing and location of scaring.

AB  - Many insular plant taxa naturally consist of small populations, which are increasingly impacted today by herbivory, climate change, and competition with invasive plants. Are some insular species fated to extinction or do they still have potential to recover? To help explore this question, we studied Schiedea adamantis, a federally endangered shrub from the Hawaiian island of O'ahu where it was originally known as a single population. This population underwent a population crash in the late 1990s, declining from >250 plants to a handful of plants before several more individuals were discovered nearby. Fortunately, plants grown from seed obtained before the bottleneck had been maintained ex situ in California. Using microsatellite markers, we confirmed that levels of genetic variation were lower in the bottlenecked population compared to the pre- bottleneck and offspring collections, but overall levels remained moderate in the wild population despite the severe reduction in size. The four remaining field individuals consisted of one plant that likely persisted through the bottleneck and its progeny. The ex situ offspring collection contained four unique alleles, indicating the value of these collections maintained offsite. Subsequently, new plants located downslope from the original population and a second genetically different population on the same island were also discovered, although numbers continue to decline. In addition to ongoing reintroduction efforts, levels of genetic variation and discovery of new individuals holds promise for in situ survival of this species, but only if its habitat can be protected from fire, increased drought, and competition from invasive species.

AB  - Fisheries bycatch is a critical threat to sea turtle populations worldwide, particularly because turtles are vulnerable to multiple gear types. The Canary Current is an intensely fished region, yet there has been no demographic assessment integrating bycatch and population management information of the globally significant Cabo Verde loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) population. Using Boa Vista island (Eastern Cabo Verde) subpopulation data from capture-recapture and nest monitoring (2013-2019), we evaluated population viability and estimated regional bycatch rates (2016-2020) in longline, trawl, purse-seine, and artisanal fisheries. We further evaluated current nesting trends in the context of bycatch estimates, existing hatchery conservation measures, and environmental (net primary productivity) variability in turtle foraging grounds. We projected that current bycatch mortality rates would lead to the near extinction of the Boa Vista subpopulation. Bycatch reduction in longline fisheries and all fisheries combined would increase finite population growth rate by 1.76% and 1.95%, respectively. Hatchery conservation increased hatchling production and reduced extinction risk, but alone it could not achieve population growth. Short-term increases in nest counts (2013-2021), putatively driven by temporary increases in net primary productivity, may be masking ongoing long-term population declines. When fecundity was linked to net primary productivity, our hindcast models simultaneously predicted these opposing long-term and short-term trends. Consequently, our results showed conservation management must diversify from land-based management. The masking effect we found has broad-reaching implications for monitoring sea turtle populations worldwide, demonstrating the importance of directly estimating adult survival and that nest counts might inadequately reflect underlying population trends.

AB  - The Chinese goral (Naemorhedus griseus) is a small goat-like animal, which is considered "vulnerable" due to its rapid decline in population in the wild. Captive breeding programs are necessary to prevent the extinction of Chinese gorals; however, reproduction in captivity reduces genetic diversity due to inbreeding. In 2020, a total of six wild Chinese gorals were introduced into a captive population of 73 individuals to improve the allelic gene pool. An assessment of captive gorals was conducted to trace and understand genetic diversity in the new captive state. Microsatellite genotyping and mitochondrial D-loop sequence analyses were performed to examine the genetic diversity and population structure. The results showed very low haplotype diversity, with a significant difference between He (0.477 +/- 0.065) and Ho (0.196 +/- 0.056), suggesting a high degree of inbreeding. This resulted in a limited ability to adapt to environmental change and low natural reproductive fitness, thus increasing the risk of population decline and eventual extinction. Management of captive breeding plans based on different subpopulations and haplotypes has been proposed to maximize genetic variability and enhance the success of future conservation plans.

AB  - The Russian Arctic supports wild sympatric ruminants and their data-deficient helminths. In this study, we: (1) collected fecal samples of wild and semiwild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus), and snow sheep (Ovis nivicola) across Palearctic North territories: Arkhangelsk Oblast (including Novaya Zemlya archipelago), Karelia and Sakha Republics, Kola, Yamal, Taimyr, and Chukotka Peninsulas, Bering, Svalbard, and Wrangel Islands; (2) conducted a coprological survey (noninvasive life-time method preferable for protected animals) to obtain eggs and larvae of helminths inhabiting digestive, respiratory, nervous, and muscular systems; (3) identified helminths according to their morphology and DNA sequences; (4) estimated parasite load per host; (5) analyzed our findings. Varestrongylus eleguneniensis (in reindeer) was reported for the Palearctic for the first time, while Orthostrongylus sp. was reported both for R. tarandus and for the Palearctic for the first time. Capillarid-type eggs were reported for snow sheep for the first time. The question of the role of wild Arctic ruminants as vectors for rotifers was raised.

AB  - The European bison continues to be a conservation dependent species, as it inhabits small reserve areas that require strict management. To ensure the species' long-term viability, it is imperative to expand both its population size and geographical range. However, achieving this expansion within its historical range poses challenges due to intensive land use and dense human populations. The objective of this study was to model the potential distribution of the European bison beyond its historical range, specifically in the boreal zone of Europe. Utilizing the maximum entropy method alongside bioclimatic variables and land use analysis, the research revealed a significant expanse of suitable territory. This suggests the feasibility of establishing a contiguous habitat capable of supporting a substantial European bison population. Factors such as ongoing global warming, deforestation, and agricultural decline are further enhancing the creation of favorable habitats for the species.

AB  - The vegetation phenology in pasture grasslands temporarily changes during the growing season due to the different physiological properties of broadleaf and cereal species. Determining their dynamics is required for maximal pasture utilization and sustainability. Widely used low-spatial resolution satellites are suitable for plains but are less effective in patchy landscapes. Therefore, the study's objectives are: (i) to determine the dynamic of cereals and broadleaf vegetation in arid grasslands using high-spatial resolution satellite imaging data, and (ii) to determine the influence of different grazing intensities on grassland vegetation phenology. The study site is in Migda LTER farm, the northern Negev, Israel. Fifty-three grassland plots, sized 10x10m, were located. Seventeen plots were grazed: six heavily (90 min. per plot), five moderately (60 min.), and six lightly (30 min.). A sheep and goats' herd of 120-130 animals grazed on these plots once a year between April to May, from 2019 to 2023. As a reference, fenced, ungrazed plots were located, mainly covered by cereals (Conserved). Imaging data from PlanetScope (R) was acquired (Spatial resolution: 3 m pixel- 1, Temporal: Once in three days, Spectral: RGB and NIR). Using a novel timeline analysis, based on normalizing the different treatments' NDVI by the Conserved values, yielded a three-phased result: a parabolic increase in fresh vegetation reflectance (FVR) from the treatment in the first and third phases, and a parabolic increase of FVR of the Conserved in the second phase. In most grazing treatments, phase duration and maximal NDVI were positively correlated to the rainfall amounts. Rehabilitation trends were calculated for the Lightly grazed, which was correlated to increased broadleaf biomass, while a degradation trend was found for the Heavily grazed. The findings indicate that a parabolic change takes place in vegetation composition in arid grasslands. The novel methodology we used can be adapted and utilized in other ecosystems.

AB  - In contrast to Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, Antarctic salps (Salpa thompsoni) respond positively to warmer water temperatures and have the ability to create massive blooms under favourable conditions. Therefore, they can compete with krill for primary production. Over the last three decades, significant variability in S. thompsoni occurrence has been observed as a response to the environmental fluctuations of the Southern Ocean ecosystem (e.g. changes in sea surface temperature and ice-cover shrinkage around the cold Antarctic waters). This study presents historical abundance data of salps from the south-west Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean, covering a time span of 26 years. These data allow tracking of fluctuations in Antarctic salp abundance and their distribution with bottom depth, temperature, and ice conditions, aiming to reveal salp hot spots and to predict the future range of S. thompsoni distribution with upcoming climate warming in the next 50 years. Results showed the highest salp density in shallow shelf waters with ice cover and low temperatures between 1 and -1 degrees C. In the studied area, S. thompsoni hot spots were located mostly around Elephant Island, but also the islands around Brensfield and Gerlache Straits, as well as to the south near the Bellingshausen Sea. Inferences made of future salp distribution suggest that the range of S. thompsoni will move southwards, enlarging their habitat area by nearly 500,000 km(2), which may have significant implications on the whole Antarctic food web. The information presented herein may be used for Antarctic ecosystem management, protection, and conservation.

AB  - Enhancing the herbivore fish stock is envisaged as a mitigation tool to reverse the macroalgal dominance in a coral reef environment. However, identifying the key species of herbivore fish that significantly controls the macroalgal abundance in a reef is critically important. The present study is aimed at determining the prospects of two common herbivore fish, Siganus javus and S. canaliculatus, in regulating the macroalgae prevalent in the Gulf of Mannar (GoM), a Marine National Park, using in situ cage experiments. Ten different macroalgal species that commonly grow over corals were collected from the GoM reefs, and a known biomass of macroalgae was fed individually to both S. javus and S. canaliculatus maintained in separate in situ cages. Grazing experiments revealed a significant difference in the macroalgae consumption rate between S. javus and S. canaliculatus. The S. javus consumed 0.9 +/- 0.7 to 10.1 +/- 1.8 g h(-1) comparatively higher than S. canaliculatus (0.5 +/- 0.14 and 4.7 +/- 0.9 g h(-1)), indicating the differential feeding ability of the closely related herbivore fish. Green filamentous macroalgae including Enteromorpha compressa and Chaetomorpha crassa were intensely grazed within 5 h of feeding trials. Though the grazing rate of Siganus spp. recorded in this study was comparable with other geographical reefs, the feeding preferences differed as the macroalgae Turbinaria ornata, Sargassum wightii, and Halimeda tuna were least consumed by both the Siganus spp., probably contributing to their long-term persistence in the coral reef ecosystem. The results presented here emphasize that the feeding pattern of Siganus spp. varied with different species of macroalgae that might play a critical role in shaping the reef community. The herbivory rate and choice of macroalgae by other herbivores should be considered to decide on the management options such as marine replenishment zones.

AB  - BACKGROUNDInvasive ungulates (hoofed mammals), including deer, feral pigs, feral goats, and feral sheep, are known to cause damage to agriculture, property, natural resources, and many other commodities. Most of the information regarding the economic impacts of wild ungulates is from North America, where some of these species are native. To evaluate invasive ungulate damage to livestock producers in the Hawaiian Islands, which have no native ungulates, a survey was distributed to livestock producers across the state.RESULTSSurvey results described how total annual costs are distributed among damage, control, and repairs for survey respondents, who represented a significant percentage of total ranchland acreage across the islands. The estimates, excluding fixed fence installation, revealed an annual cost to livestock producers who responded to the survey of US$1.42 million, which ranged from $3.6 million to $7.5 million when extrapolated to the entire state. The large cost contributors included damage to property, pastureland repair, control costs (excluding fencing), supplemental feed, and predation of calves by wild pigs. Additionally, producers reported spending more than $2 million in upfront fence installation costs. Most of these costs were reported by respondents on the islands of Hawai'i and Moloka'i.CONCLUSIONStudy results revealed substantial damage to state livestock producers due to wild ungulates and are useful in determining an invasive ungulate management strategy that can appropriately aid the most impacted sectors of Hawai'i.

AB  - Introduction: Passive and active restoration approaches have been often considered as different alternatives to achieve the ecological restoration of a degraded site. This false dichotomy has been overcome in terrestrial ecosystems, for which a range of restoration approaches have often been applied within the same restoration project, creating a continuum of interventions. In the marine environment, the combined approach based on passive and active restoration is less studied. Methods: Here, we tested the possibility of actively restoring a macroalgal population in a historically polluted industrial site, subjected to decadal passive restoration (i.e., unassisted, or spontaneous recovery following cessation of industrial activity), in theMediterranean Sea. Recently, it has been demonstrated that in the site under scrutiny, there is no longer any sign of the historical contamination or impact on benthic fauna therefore the environmental conditions are indistinguishable from surrounding non-impacted areas. We used artificial breakwater barriers already present in the site to restore a population of the brown algae Gongolaria barbata. The intervention was conducted by applying an in situ recruitment approach and a complementary action using cages to exclude the herbivores. The G. barbata recruits were transplanted on the artificial reefs and after they reached the maximum growth inside the cages, one cage was opened and another one was completely removed to also test the grazing pressure. The associated benthic assemblages were also analysed in terms of meio- and macrofaunal abundance, the richness of taxa, and taxonomic composition. Results and discussion: Our results indicate that, at least over a relatively short period (i.e., 6 months), the use of the cages represents a useful tool to let the macroalgae grow enough to counterbalance the herbivory pressure. The associated fauna below the macroalgae was characterized by a different taxonomic composition when compared to controls (i.e., artificial reefs without the macroalgae), particularly when considered the rare taxa. In conclusion, the combination of passive and active restoration can be considered a useful approach to restore marine sites degraded by historical industrial activities.

AB  - Wildlife feeding and nutrition are key drivers of several demographic parameters, such as breeding success and survival, influencing long-term population viability. To comply with the diet requirements that ensure offspring survival, parents adapt their forage strategies to the environmental conditions and resource availability. This is especially important for central-place foragers like raptors, where prey availability in the surroundings of nest and livestock carcasses significantly impact both foraging efforts and breeding success. Here we take advantage of 20 years extensive monitoring (2001-2020) of the Canarian Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus majorensis) on the Fuerteventura Island (Canary Islands, Spain) to assess (1) what factors drive vulture diet diversity and, (2) how the number of livestock and diet diversity coupled together with environmental conditions affect breeding success and, ultimately, the conservation of vulture populations. We identified 3,787 prey items belonging to 37 different species. Diet diversity was positively related to the number of wild prey and to low livestock grazing pressure periods. Breeding success was positively related to the number of wild prey, low herbivory pressure and, to a lesser extent, to diet diversity. These results demonstrate the importance of wild prey on Canarian Egyptian vulture's diet, albeit livestock carcasses are the most abundant feeding resource. We argue that livestock have controversial conservation implications for this species because it provides a stable feeding resource, but, in turn, is one of the major ecosystem disruptors. Overgrazing by livestock can negatively affect wild primary consumers, which are essential for this endemic vulture population.

AB  - Zoysia japonica, a low growing grass, is tolerant to grazing and trampling. Kinkazan Island in northern Japan is inhabited by sika deer (Cervus nippon). The deer population increased in the 1970s at a shrine garden in the western part of the island, leading to expansion of Zoysia swards around the shrine garden and their colonization of remote open patches. The expansion around the garden is due to elongation of the rhizome, but expansion to remote places may be due to endozoochory by deer. This appears to be a good example of the "foliage is the fruit" hypothesis (the FF hypothesis) proposed by Janzen (1984; American Naturalist 123:338-353). To demonstrate this, we confirmed the expansion of the Zoysia swards and tested the traits of Zoysia by field surveys and indoor experiments. The Zoysia peduncles stood among the leaves, and sika deer fed on both the seeds and leaves. One deer fecal pellet contained about 20 seeds at its peak in June. In the feeding experiment, the survival rate through digestion was 38%. In the greenhouse experiment, the germination rate was 72%. An outdoor experiment showed that germination rates of the ingested seeds were 5% in a dark habitat and 58% in a bright habitat. Zoysia exhibited many of the traits presented by the FF hypothesis, and sika deer functioned as seed dispersal agents. Therefore, the Zoysia-sika deer relationship seems to support the FF hypothesis.

AB  - Wildlife plays an important role in the emergence of livestock diseases, and their movements can complicate disease management efforts. One of the most significant vector-borne diseases of livestock worldwide is bovine babesiosis, spread by cattle fever ticks (CFTs; Rhipicephalus [=Boophilus] microplus and Rhipicephalus [=Boophilus] annulatus). Although CFTs were eradicated from the United States by 1943, bovine babesiosis and CFTs are prevalent in Mexico. Recently, management of CFTs in the Texas-Mexico region has been complicated by the presence of free-ranging, exotic nilgai antelope (Boselaphus tragocamelus). Nilgai are abundant in this region and are competent hosts for CFTs. The goal of this study was to better understand nilgai movements and space use to inform CFT treatment strategies. We analyzed hourly locations from 40 GPS-collared nilgai in Cameron County, TX, USA, from April 2019 to September 2020. We assigned each nilgai a movement behavior using the net squared displacement metric. We estimated nilgai home range sizes at different temporal scales (monthly, seasonally, and overall) using Brownian bridge movement models. We observed movement patterns consistent with residency (52.5%), seasonal movers (17.5%), dispersal (5%), and unclassified (25%). Resident nilgai had an average maximum axial distance of 7.8 km, while two young females made separate dispersal movements of about 40 km within a year. Overall, nilgai had large and highly variable home ranges: annual median home range estimate for females was 563 ha (range = 105-1545 ha), and for males, it was 937 ha (range = 221-1602 ha). Peak nilgai movements occurred during crepuscular hours, and median hourly movement for females was 57 m/h, and for males, it was 66 m/h. Nilgai home ranges and long-distance movements have the potential to overlap multiple ranches, as the typical ranch size in South Texas ranges from 250 to 6000 ha. Resident nilgai were more likely to maintain local infestations of CFT. Dispersal events took place during peak tick season, demonstrating the potential for nilgai to aid in the spread of CFT. Understanding these behaviors will help the CFT Eradication Program develop more efficacious treatment strategies to treat infestations in nilgai.

AB  - Recycling of solid biowaste and manure would reduce the dependence of agriculture on synthetic products. Most of the available studies on the effects of exogenous organic matter (EOM) application to soil were focused on nutrients and crop yield, with much less attention to microbiological processes in soil, especially using modern molecular methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of various types of manure, sewage sludge and bottom sediment on the biochemical activity and biodiversity of soil and plant yield in a pot experiment. The soil was treated with a range of EOM types: six types of manure (cattle, pig, goat, poultry, rabbit and horse manure; two bottom sediments (from urban and rural systems); and two types of municipal sewage sludge. All EOMs stimulated dehydrogenases activity at a rate of 20 t ha(-1). Alkaline phosphatase was mostly stimulated by poultry manure and one of the sludges. In general, the two-fold greater rate of EOMs did not further accelerate the soil enzymes. The functional diversity of the soil microbiome was stimulated the most by cattle and goat manure. EOMs produce a shift in distribution of the most abundant bacterial phyla and additionally introduce exogenous bacterial genera to soil. Poultry and horse manure introduced the greatest number of new genera that were able to survive the strong competition in soil. EOMs differentiated plant growth in our study, which was correlated to the rate of nitrate release to soil. The detailed impacts of particular amendments were EOM-specific, but in general, no harm for microbial parameters was observed for manure and sludge application, regardless of their type. There was also no proof that the PAH and pesticide contents measured in manure or sludge had any effect on microbial activity and diversity.

AB  - Buckspoor spiders (Araneae: Eresidae: Seothyra Purcell) are a distinct lineage of burrow-inhabiting web-building spiders endemic to the arid and semi-arid parts of southern Africa. We investigated the role of substrate and vegetation characteristics on site selection in Seothyra schreineri Purcell in the xeric Nama Karoo of the western Free State Province, South Africa. We studied web densities in two 0.5 ha plots in an open habitat grazed by sheep and found declining web densities with increasing distance from the border fence. Web densities in the 1 m2 plots were negatively correlated with increasing grass density, positively correlated with increasing percentage fine gravel, whereas shrub cover, litter, hard soil and stones had a very weak effect. Our results indicate that the spatial distribution of fine gravel in Nama Karoo landscapes is a key factor determining the occurrence of S. schreineri, a finding that can guide future sampling efforts, leading to a more complete prediction of the species' distribution and, ultimately, its overall conservation status.

AB  - In the Anthropocene, algal turfs are expected to replace macroalgal forests and coral cover as the dominant benthic state. These turf seascapes play a key role in regulating ecosystem processes through sediment retention, which carries significant ecological and socio-economic implications. However, our understanding of sediments trapped by turf on coastal reefs, particularly in oceanic islands, remains limited. In this study, we quantified turf seascape architecture (algal composition and mean height) and sediment properties (total particulate load, grain size distribution, and organic content) across a warm-temperate oceanic island. We further decoupled the role of geomorphological, anthropogenic, and turf algae structural predictors in explaining spatial variation in turf sediment properties. Our results revealed significant spatial variation in turf sediment loads, varying by three orders of magnitude (similar to 1 g/m(2) to 2000 g/m(2)), while organic load varied by two orders of magnitude (similar to 1 g/m(2) to 100 g/m(2)). Human pressure and turf algal composition were the strongest predictors of turf sediment load, highlighting the role of local human stressors in modulating sediment dynamics in emerging turf seascapes. Our study provides baseline information on the patterns and drivers of turf sediments in oceanic islands, a critical area to develop management plans that target the resilience of core ecosystem functions under altered reef configurations in the Anthropocene.

AB  - In fragmented forests, edge effects can drive intraspecific variation in seedling performance that influences forest regeneration and plant composition. However, few studies have attempted to disentangle the relative biotic and abiotic drivers of intraspecific variation in seedling performance. In this study, we carried out a seedling transplant experiment with a factorial experimental design on three land-bridge islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China, using four common native woody plant species. At different distances from the forest edge (2, 8, 32, 128 m), we transplanted four seedlings of each species into each of three cages: full-cage, for herbivore exclusion; half-cage, that allowed herbivore access but controlled for caging artifacts; and no-cage control. In the 576 cages, we recorded branch architecture, leaf traits, and seedling survival for each seedling before and after the experimental treatment. Overall, after one full growing season, edge-induced abiotic drivers and varied herbivory pressure led to intraspecific variation in seedling performance, including trade-offs in seedling architecture and resource-use strategies. However, responses varied across species with different life-history strategies and depended on the driver in question, such that the abiotic and biotic effects were additive across species, rather than interactive. Edge-induced abiotic variation modified seedling architecture of a shade-tolerant species, leading to more vertical rather than lateral growth at edges. Meanwhile, increased herbivory pressure resulted in a shift toward lower dry matter investment in leaves of a light-demanding species. Our results suggest that edge effects can drive rapid directional shifts in the performance and intraspecific traits of some woody plants from early ontogenetic stages, but most species in this study showed negligible phenotypic responses to edge effects. Moreover, species-specific responses suggest the importance of interspecific differences modulating the degree of trait plasticity, implying the need to incorporate individual-level responses when understanding the impact of forest fragmentation on plant communities.

AB  - Determining whether cryptic remnant animal populations survive within specific landscapes is a conservation challenge and may require multiple types of information. Hainan Island, China, has lost most of its large mammal fauna, with no recent evidence for persistence of large carnivores. We conducted a survey of local ecological knowledge in communities around seven protected areas in 2015, collecting sighting reports of the Asiatic black bear Ursus thibetanus. Respondents living near Wuzhishan National Nature Reserve reported the highest number of dated sightings as well as the most recent sightings. In follow-up interviews, wildlife rangers at Wuzhishan reported recent signs of bears and local hunting, and a possible bear photograph was taken inside the Reserve in 2017. Characteristic bear signs, including fresh diagnostic claw marks on trees, were detected at Wuzhishan in 2021, confirming bear presence. Wuzhishan is the last area in Hainan where large herbivores and carnivores survive, and where local conservation efforts still have the potential to maintain functional forest ecosystems that support megafaunal assemblages.

AB  - Several biophysical factors are leading to the loss of biodiversity, among them the dominance of exotic invasive species on native communities is important. Their dominance can lead to changes in the structure of insect communities, by competing and displacing native species to other crops or habitats. These changes can impact the herbivore's natural enemies in invaded areas by diverging them from suitable herbivores and altering their biological control process. The development of edible insects and derived products at an industrial scale can also have an impact on the local fauna by the risks of spillover and accidental release in nature. Several area-wide integrated pest management programs are also using the sterile insect technique to control insect pests and disease' vectors. This technique is becoming largely used; however, its application as 'non-intrusive to the environment' is controversial particularly when eradication is concerning species that are at the basis of food webs.

AB  - The majority of multi-cellular terrestrial life is found in tropical forests and is either an invertebrate or a plant: for decades ecologists have sought to understand why. As global change erodes the list of extant species on our planet quantifying what species remain, along with their origins and ecology, contributes to our ability to preserve ecosystem functioning and resilience. Here we study three feeding guilds of caterpillars (Lepidoptera) and seek to understand the drivers of their diet breadth across four diverse tropical plant genera in Papua New Guinea. Host specificity is central to biodiversity estimates and the resilience of ecological networks. Specifically, we calculate distance-based host specificity in relation to plant phylogenetic relationships alongside chemical and mechanical traits of leaves. In terms of chemical defenses, we focus on the major polyphenol groups, a compound class shared across many plant species. We refine our data exploration using food webs and ordinations to pick out specific traits of relevance to insect host specificity. Our results showed that the degree of specialization for caterpillars took the following order: phylogenetic>polyphenol>mechanical, such that insect specificity was explained best by host phylogeny and polyphenol chemistry in our study system. Leaf mining insects had higher host specificity than those feeding externally. Of the traits studied hexahydroxydiphenoyl derivatives, galloyl derivatives, trichome density, quinic acid derivatives, myricetins and successional index explained the most variation in overall insect community structure. Our findings build on earlier studies of New Guinean rainforest communities and add a mechanistic explanation to previous findings that host genera are functional islands for insect herbivores. Further, we demonstrate that different plant genera combine different defensive traits that appear to drive associated insect diversity. Our approach integrates trait data and phylogeny to explore dimensions of specialization and we welcome metabolomic studies that will provide more detailed explanations for insect-herbivore host use. Finally, chemical diversity is directly linked to organismal diversity and by studying a range of insect herbivore guilds we make a connection between feeding ecology and specialization that will help to predict species interactions and, potentially, the persistence of ecological networks.

AB  - Natural processes and patterns are altered by human activity at different spatial and temporal scales, affecting species assemblages and population traits, modifying mechanisms or regulating dynamics at different scales. However, little is known about the influence of landscape structure on small mammal assemblages and populations on farms. Thus, in this work, we aimed to study the effect of landscape and environmental characteristics at the farm scale on the assemblage and populations of native and introduced small mammals in pig and dairy farms located in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Our results showed that farms in contexts of higher environmental diversity at the landscape scale have higher species richness. Our results also showed that variations in assemblage composition were associated with the quantity of water body surfaces, cattle food, small mammal refugia, and impervious surfaces at the farm scale-and with woodland, grassland, and natural vegetation cover at the landscape scale. The abundance of commensal murids was higher on farms near towns, with higher vegetation cover at the farm scale and/or in landscape contexts with fewer crops. The abundance of Akodon azarae was higher on farms with a lower amount of cattle food at the farm scale and crop patches in the landscape. The abundance of Didelphis albiventris was higher during spring on farms with a low proportion of bare ground, while that of Lutreolina crassicaudata was higher on farms with high vegetation cover and a lower number of water body surfaces. These results show the relevance of multiscale determinants in the development of ecologically based management strategies to control pest small mammals.
   Our research addresses the influence of landscape and farm structure on small mammals. Our results show multiscale determinants on small mammal assemblages and population abundances. Our findings reveal associations, linking water bodies, vegetation cover, and landscape structure to assemblage composition and abundance. Species richness increased with landscape heterogeneity.
   Los procesos y patrones naturales se ven alterados por la actividad humana a distintas escalas espaciales y temporales, afectando tanto a los ensambles de especies como a sus poblaciones, modificando mecanismos o regulando sus dinamicas en distintas escalas. Poco es lo que se sabe acerca de la influencia de la estructura del paisaje sobre dichos ensambles y poblaciones. En este trabajo, estudiamos el efecto del paisaje y de variables ambientales dentro de las granjas sobre el ensamble y las poblaciones de pequenos mamiferos nativos e introducidos, en criaderos de cerdos y tambos de la provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina. Nuestros resultados muestran que establecimientos en contextos de mayor diversidad ambiental a escala de paisaje poseen mayor riqueza especifica. Ademas, muestran que las variaciones en la composicion de los ensambles estuvieron asociadas a las proporciones de agua, comida para ganado, refugio para pequenos mamiferos y superficies impermeables a escala de granja y a las proporciones de arboles, pastizales y parches de vegetacion natural a escala del paisaje. Las poblaciones de muridos comensales fueron mayores en establecimientos cercanos a las ciudades, con mayor cobertura vegetal alta y en contextos de paisajes sin cultivos. Las abundancias de Akodon azarae fueron menores en verano y mayores en establecimientos con menor proporcion de comida para ganado y de parches de cultivo en el paisaje. La abundancia de Didelphis albiventris fue mayor durante la primavera en establecimientos con baja proporcion de suelo desnudo, mientras que la abundancia de Lutreolina crassicaudata fue mayor en granjas con coberturas vegetales altas y con menor proporcion de agua. Estos resultados muestran la pertinencia de los analisis multiescala para la elaboracion de estrategias de manejo de pequenos mamiferos plagas basadas en fundamentos ecologicos.

AB  - We analyzed long-term camera-trap data from Protected Areas in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest to study activity patterns of coexisting peccary species (Tayassu pecari and Dicotyles tajacu) and the exotic wild boar (Sus scrofa). The highest pattern overlap was between D. tajacu and S. scrofa (Delta 1 = 0.78), followed by T. pecari and S. scrofa (Delta 1 = 0.64), and the lowest between D. tajacu and T. pecari (Delta 1 = 0.61). In the presence of feral pigs, collared peccary activity exhibited two distinct peaks, occurring in the late evening and early morning. When coexisting with white-lipped peccaries, their activity peaks early in the evening and again in the mid-morning, potentially enabling them to avoid overlapping with the activity peaks of white-lipped peccaries, which are distributed throughout the day. Our findings suggest a potential interference of wild boars in the temporal niche dynamics of native peccaries across various areas within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome. Nonetheless, we emphasize the imperative for more focused investigations at both regional micro and macro scales throughout the Atlantic Forest, specifically delving into other dimensions of the niche, such as food and habitat utilization among the three species.

AB  - Better knowledge of genetic relationships between the Fortymile caribou herd and its neighbors is needed for conservation decision-making in Canada. Here, we contribute the first fine-scale analysis of genetic population structure in nine contiguous caribou herds at the geographic boundaries between Barren-ground and Northern Mountain caribou, and at the Alaska-Yukon border. Using pairwise differentiation metrics, STRUCTURE, and discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) to analyze 15 microsatellite loci in 379 caribou, we found complex patterns of genetic differentiation. The Fortymile was the only herd assigned to more than one genetic cluster, indicative of its history as a larger herd whose range expansions and gene flow to other herds were likely important to maintaining diversity across a functioning genetic metapopulation. Some small herds (Chisana, Klaza, and White Mountains) were genetically distinct, while others (Hart River, Clear Creek, Mentasta) exhibited little differentiation from herds they occasionally overlap, including herds assigned to different conservation units (DUs). This genetic connectivity does not result from demographic connectivity, as episodic contact during rut, rather than herd switching, is the likely mechanism. Unusually, one small herd (White Mountains) maintained genetic differentiation despite rut overlap with Fortymile. Our data reveal that some herds with different ecological and behavioral attributes are demographically independent but nonetheless genetically connected. Thus, we suggest that managing caribou for an appropriate level of genetic connectivity, while also supporting herd persistence, will be essential to conserve caribou genetic diversity in the region.

AB  - Simple Summary We used camera traps to survey wild mammals in a portion of western Thailand and recorded 32 species, 17 of which were IUCN-listed from Near Threatened to Critically Endangered. Of all photo-captures, 4 species comprised 62%, and several species were captured only rarely. This area holds a rich community of mammals, but some differences in photo-rates from an adjacent sanctuary and comparisons with other research on local mammals suggest that some species were missed because of their rarity and the limitations of the technique used. The Thung Yai Naresuan (East) Wildlife Sanctuary (TYNE), in the core area of the Western Forest Complex of Thailand, harbors a diverse assemblage of wildlife, and the region has become globally significant for mammal conservation. From April 2010 to January 2012, 106 camera traps were set, and, in 1817 trap-nights, registered 1821 independent records of 32 mammal species. Of the 17 IUCN-listed (from Near Threatened to Critically Endangered) mammal species recorded, 5 species listed as endangered or critically endangered included the Asiatic elephant (Elephas maximus), tiger (Panthera tigris), Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus), dhole (Cuon alpinus), and Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica). The northern red muntjac (Muntiacus vaginalis), large Indian civet (Viverra zibetha), Malayan porcupine (Hystrix brachyuran), and sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) were the most frequently recorded species (10-22 photos/100 trap-nights), representing 62% of all independent records, while the golden jackal (Canis aureus), clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), marbled cat (Pardofelis marmorata), and Sunda pangolin were the least photographed (<0.1/100 trap-nights). Species accumulation curves indicated that the number of camera trap locations needed to record 90% of taxa recorded varied from 26 sites for herbivores to 67 sites for all mammals. TYNE holds a rich community of mammals, but some differences in photo-rates from an adjacent sanctuary and comparisons with other research on local mammals suggest that some species are rare and some are missed because of the limitations of our technique. We also conclude that the management and conservation plan, which involves the exclusion of human activities from some protected areas and strict protection efforts in the sanctuaries, is still suitable for providing key habitats for endangered wildlife populations, and that augmented and regular survey efforts will help in this endeavor.

AB  - Climate change has altered precipitation regimes with concomitant influences in hydrology. For a complex assemblage of ungulates, these water-level fluctuations might alter habitat partitioning thought to be crucial for coexistence in response to livestock introduction. We placed camera traps in three habitat types along the Mayanja River in central Uganda to evaluate space use by native and domestic ungulates. For each species, we assessed the difference in the proportion of days with camera-trap detections during three water-level conditions (low in 2017, normal in 2015, and high in 2016). Sitatunga was the only species regularly using wetlands; their use of remote wetlands remained consistent regardless of water-level conditions, and their use of forest habitats decreased during the study. In the forest, warthogs showed no change in use, while proportion of days with detections increased over time for all other ungulates. Our results indicate that ungulate community space use appears to be independent of hydrologic condition, and that risk for competitive exclusion between native and domestic ungulates is tempered by dietary and habitat use differences. Adaptations to dynamic hydrology appears to buffer consequences for ungulate communities; more serious are habitat losses to agriculture and development.

AB  - The long-spined sea urchin Diadema africanum is a key herbivore in sublittoral ecosystems of the Eastern Atlantic, mediating shifts between productive macroalgae beds and barren grounds. Historical increases in D. africanum densities have been linked to predator overfishing and rising temperatures favoring settlement. However, recurrent mass mortality events have recently decimated populations, reversing benthic communities from urchin barrens to macroalgal beds across the Canary Islands. We investigated the influence of biological factors, such as adult density and macroalgal coverage, alongside physical variables, including substrate rugosity, crevice presence, and slope, on the distribution of newly settled D. africanum prior to mass mortality events. In 2004, when D. africanum densities were high, early recruits were positively associated with adult habitats and negatively with areas dominated by erect, non-calcareous algae. These findings highlight that a combination of adult conspecifics, high structural complexity, and crustose coralline algae favored D. africanum recruitment, while macroalgal habitats were unfavorable. Surveys in 2024, following recurrent mass mortalities, revealed a dramatic phase shift from encrusting corallines to erect algae and a recruitment failure of D. africanum. This recent shift has altered former favorable habitats, potentially compromising recruit survival and hindering population recovery.

AB  - A critical assumption of standard distance sampling is that sampling lines are located such that animals are uniformly distributed as a function of distance from the line. Failure to meet this assumption can introduce bias in the estimator. Many studies have used landscape features, such as roads or rivers, as lines, which can violate assumptions of distance sampling in two ways. First, animals may be attracted or repelled by the landscape feature due to human activity (e.g. along roads) or habitat characteristics associated with the feature (e.g. rivers). Second, sampling along landscape features may not be representative of the larger area of interest. We used auxiliary data to generalize the distance sampling estimator and relax assumptions of a uniform distribution of animals relative to distance from the line (i.e. density gradient) and to allow the distribution of animals to differ by habitat type. The generalized estimator provides unbiased estimates of density within the area sampled but may not be representative of the study area. To address the problem of landscape features providing unrepresentative sampling, we used a resource selection model to estimate the proportion of the population that occurred within the surveyed area to obtain an estimate of abundance for the desired area of inference. We demonstrate our modified distance sampling estimator using white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in a 972-km2 study area. We conducted infrared surveys of deer from roads to collect distance-to-transect data. We used locations of radio-collared deer to model the distribution of deer relative to the transects and to develop a resource selection model of deer based on distance to roads, habitat type, elevation and slope to account for roads being a non-representative sample of the study area. Synthesis and applications. When using landscape features as survey lines, the density gradient and deer distribution can introduce either positive or negative bias, which makes it impossible to assess the bias introduced without auxiliary data. The estimator we developed can improve precision because we obtained a better fit to distance observations and accounts for non-random placement of transects with minimal loss of precision.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Ginkgo biloba L. (Ginkgo, Maidenhair tree) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the International Biological Flora: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, reproductive and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, conservation and global heterogeneity. Globally, Ginkgo survives a wide range of mean annual temperature (-3.3 to 23.3 degrees C) and annual precipitation (34-3925 mm) conditions, according to a meta-analysis. It prefers a warm, humid, open-canopy and a well-drained environment. The species shows strong tolerance to drought, freezing, fire, air pollution, heavy metals and low-level salt, whereas it is intolerant to long-time shade and waterlogging. Six Ginkgo trees even survived the atom bomb in Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II. Ginkgo is susceptible to few diseases. Those occurring in nursery seedlings and juvenile trees involve stem rot and leaf blight. The former is caused by Macrophomina phaseoli, which could lead to a mortality rate of 5%-12% (up to 31.8%) for seedlings. This disease can be mitigated by a 4-h shading treatment and applying organic fertilisers. The pathogens inducing leaf blight include Alternaria alternata, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Pestalotia ginkgo, which may infect 100% juvenile trees in some regions. The application of 45% carbendazim or 50% Tuzet can effectively prevent leaf blight. Ginkgo biloba is one of the world's most distinctive trees with an important position in plant evolution and human society. It is a tall deciduous dioecious tree native to China. Refugial populations were identified in three glacial refugia located in eastern, southern and south-western China, respectively, with a patchy distribution pattern and a small population size. It typically grows along flood-disturbed streamsides in warm-temperate deciduous (and evergreen mixed) broadleaved forests. Ginkgo may have been introduced repeatedly out of China since the sixth century. It has been planted as a landscape tree world-wide, except in Antarctica. Ginkgo is also of great value for edible nuts, herbal medicine, religion and art. It is a natural and cultural symbol of China.

AB  - Feral deer are widespread throughout Australia with the capacity to impact livestock production via transmission of parasites. Samples of Dama dama (fallow deer), Rusa unicolor (sambar deer), Cervus elaphus (red deer) and an unidentified deer were sourced from various locations in south-eastern Australia for examination for parasites. Adult nematodes were collected from the lungs of all deer species across four separate geographical locations. The nematodes were identified as species of Dictyocaulus through both morphological and molecular means. Species identification based on morphological features was difficult, with many measurements from described species overlapping. Molecular analyses targeting three markers, namely 18S rRNA, ITS2, and cox1 revealed the presence of two distinct species: Dictyocaulus cervi and Dictyocaulus skrjabini. These are the first genetically confirmed reports of species of Dictyocaulus in feral deer in Australia, and although cross-transmission of species of Dictyocaulus with livestock has not yet been reported, it cannot be completely discounted without further research.

AB  - Duzlercami Wildlife Reserve Area (WRA) is the last natural habitat of fallow deer (Dama dama) in the world. Fallow deer is native to Turkey, however, its geographical range is currently confined to Duzlercami WRA, Antalya. To date, a detailed habitat investigation of fallow deer distribution has not been conducted. This study is vital for the last surviving populations of fallow deer in Turkey. Therefore, we studied the habitat suitability and utilization of fallow deer in the Duzlercami WRA. Vegetation and wildlife inventory was surveyed across a total of 304 sample areas between 2015 and 2017. Plant species were recorded according to the Braun-Blanquet method and wildlife surveys were based on footprints, feces, and other signs of fallow deer. Classification and regression tree techniques, as well as MAXENT, were used to model vegetation and fallow deer habitat. Topographic position index, terrain ruggedness index, roughness index, elevation, and bedrock formation were also calculated and included in the models. Based on our results, we drafted a habitat protection map for fallow deer. To ensure sustainability of habitats where populations of fallow deer are found in Turkey, we developed recommendations such as closuring human access of the 1st-degree Protection Area and reintroduction of the species to other potential habitats.

AB  - IntroductionOcean fronts are moving ephemeral biological hotspots forming at the interface of cooler and warmer waters. In the open ocean, this is where marine organisms, ranging from plankton to mesopelagic fish up to megafauna, gather and where most fishing activities concentrate. Fronts are critical ecosystems so that understanding their spatio-temporal variability is essential not only for conservation goals but also to ensure sustainable fisheries. The Mozambique Channel (MC) is an ideal laboratory to study ocean front variability due to its energetic flow at sub-to-mesoscales, its high biodiversity and the currently debated conservation initiatives. Meanwhile, fronts detection relying solely on remotely-sensed Sea Surface Temperature (SST) cannot access aspects of the subsurface frontal activity that may be relevant for understanding ecosystem dynamics. MethodIn this study, we used the Belkin and O'Reilly Algorithm on remotely-sensed SST and hindcasts of a high-resolution nested ocean model to investigate the spatial and seasonal variability of temperature fronts at different depths in the MC. ResultsWe find that the seasonally varying spatial patterns of frontal activity can be interpreted as resulting from main features of the mean circulation in the MC region. In particular, horizontally, temperature fronts are intense and frequent along continental shelves, in islands' wakes, at the edge of eddies, and in the pathways of both North-East Madagascar Current (NEMC) and South-East Madagascar Current (SEMC). In austral summer, thermal fronts in the MC are mainly associated with the Angoche upwelling and seasonal variability of the Mozambique current. In austral winter, thermal fronts in the MC are more intense when the NEMC and the Seychelles-Chagos and South Madagascar upwelling cells intensify. Vertically, the intensity of temperature fronts peaks in the vicinity of the mean thermocline. DiscussionConsidering the marked seasonality of frontal activity evidenced here and the dynamical connections of the MC circulation with equatorial variability, our study calls for addressing longer timescales of variability to investigate how ocean ecosystem/front interactions will evolve with climate change.

AB  - As white-tailed deer populations increase in developed and urban areas, lethal management is necessary to control population growth. However, concerns about safety and negative attitudes towards lethal control and using firearms near houses have prompted many communities to pursue nonlethal techniques. Therefore, in 2014 we initiated a 5-year project to attempt to stabilize the local deer population on Bald Head Island (BHI), North Carolina, using the immunocontraceptive GonaCon (TM). Since 2014 we captured and inoculated 77 female deer with GonaCon (TM) From 2017 to 2018 we evaluated the efficacy and cost of GonaCon (TM) at reducing pregnancy in adult female white-tailed deer on BHI. We obtained blood samples from 49 deer that had received either 1 or 2 doses of GonaCon (TM), and from 19 female deer that had received no GonaCon (TM) for pregnancy analysis using the pregnancy specific protein B assay. All untreated deer sampled were pregnant (n = 19), whereas 67% of deer sampled that received only a single dose were pregnant (n = 27), and 14% of deer that received 2 doses (n = 22) were pregnant. Thus, 2 doses of GonaCon (TM) were necessary to reduce pregnancy rates below 50%. The total direct cost of the 5-year immunocontraception project was $320,030.52 and averaged $2,078.12/capture with an overall efficacy of 33% for one dose and 86% for 2 doses of GonaCon (TM) Conversely, the estimated cost for the local government (i.e., Village of Bald Head Island) to cull 30 deer in 2018 was $16,163.63, or $538.79/deer. The estimated deer population was 113 in 2014 and increased to 198 individuals by 2018. Further population projections suggested the white-tailed deer population is projected to reach 342 individuals by 2022. Although 2 doses of GonaCon (TM) were effective at reducing pregnancy, administration across the BHI deer population was not successful in reducing the deer population, and culling will likely be necessary to reduce the population.

AB  - Density is a fundamental ecological parameter that is often difficult to estimate in large herbivores due to the wide spatial extent of their populations and imperfect detectability of individuals. We searched Google Earth imagery using an independent double-observer protocol to estimate elk Cervus elaphus density in Yellowstone National Park, WY, USA, on summer range that had never been systematically surveyed. Detectability of elk was high at 0.836 (95% CRI: 0.769, 0.909) producing high precision in our density estimates. Elk density estimates ranged from a minimum of 8.9 elk km(-2) over a 214.8 km(2) search area (95% CRI: 7.9, 10.9) to a maximum of 14.0 elk km(-2) over 98.5 km(2) of nonforested, alpine terrain (95% CRI: 13.5, 14.9). These estimates of elk density are comparable to the highest elk densities ever recorded in Yellowstone which primarily derive from winter, at low elevations, prior to wolf Canis lupus reintroduction. A log-linear positive effect of open landcover on density suggested preference for open terrain. Multiple survey designs may be possible with satellite imagery that would allow further refinement of noninvasive abundance estimation over large scales.

AB  - Gobiidae (Teleostei: Gobiiformes) is one of the largest fish families within the teleosts, with a worldwide distribution inhabiting fresh, brackish, and marine waters. The gobiid fishes of the western Indian Ocean remain insufficiently studied, with many species either misidentified or their diversity underestimated. Available data are limited to only a few species, primarily due to their low economic value, small size, cryptic appearance, incomplete geographic sampling, and occurrence in hard-to-sample habitats. The Indo-Pacific tropical sand goby, Favonigobius reichei, belongs to the Gobiopsis lineage within the subfamily Gobiinae and is distributed across the Indo-West Pacific. Here, we report the presence of this cryptic species in the coastal waters of Qeshm Island, marking the first record for the Persian Gulf. We also provide a detailed morphological description, along with a COI-based phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis of the newly collected samples.

AB  - Eliminating supplemental feeding is a common regulatory action within chronic wasting disease (CWD) management zones. These regulations target the potential for increased animal-animal contact and environmental contamination with CWD prions. Prions, the causative agent of CWD, have been detected on feeder surfaces in CWD-positive, captive deer facilities but not among free-ranging populations, and information on the relative risk of transmission at anthropogenic and natural food sources is limited. In this study, we established and maintained 13 gravity feeders from September 2022 to March 2023 in a CWD zone in northern Mississippi, USA (apparent prevalence similar to 30%). We set up feeders up in 3 ways: no exclusion (deer feeders, n = 7), exclusion of deer using fencing with holes cut at the ground-level to permit smaller wildlife to enter (raccoon feeders, n = 3), and environmental control feeders, which were fully fenced and not filled with feed (control feeders, n = 3). We swabbed feeder spouts at setup and at 4 intervals approximately 6 weeks apart to test for prion contamination via real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC). We detected prions 12 weeks after setup on all deer and raccoon feeders. We compared relative transmission risk using camera traps at these feeders, 6 agronomic plantings for wildlife forage (i.e., food plots), and 7 oak mast trees. Weekly visitation rate by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter: deer) differed (P = 0.02) among deer feeders (median = 24.5 deer/week, range = 15.6-65.7), food plots (median = 12.7, range = 3.8-24.7), and mast trees (median = 2.0, range = 0.4-5.1). Contact rates between individual deer also differed between site types (P < 0.01): deer feeders (median = 2.1 deer-to-deer contacts/week, range = 0-10.1), food plots (median = 0.1, range = 0-4.0), and mast trees (median = 0, range = 0-0.3). Raccoons also visited feeders at greater rates than food plots and mast trees (P < 0.04). Finally, we swabbed 19 feeders in 2 areas where CWD was newly detected, finding prion contamination on swabs from 4 feeders. We show that deer feeders in free-ranging populations with high CWD prevalence become contaminated with CWD prions quickly, becoming a potential site of exposure of deer to CWD prions. Our results also demonstrate the ability to find evidence of prion contamination on deer feeders, even in areas where CWD is newly detected.

AB  - The blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus; Burchell, 1823) is an African ungulate that is notoriously difficult to hand-rear and reintegrate into managed herds. The following case report is of a female wildebeest neonate that was orphaned, bottle-reared, and successfully reintroduced into a herd at a zoological facility. Since blue wildebeests are a highly precocial and herd-oriented species that calve synchronously in the wild as a reproductive strategy to maximize survival, early release of assist-reared neonates into managed herds before weaning may be an effective strategy for increasing the chance of acceptance. Wildebeest calves can also be easily trained for bottle-feedings in the field to facilitate early release. Due to a lack of literature on the assisted rearing and reintegration of wildebeest calves into managed herds, this case report provides useful techniques for the feeding, training, and releasing of bottle-reared wildebeests that may also be applicable to other assist-reared herd species at zoological facilities.

AB  - Understanding the origins and habitat connectivity of sea turtles with wide habitat ranges is essential for their conservation. Although loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta are found annually in the seas around the Korean Peninsula, their genetic diversity and origins remain unclear. We analyzed partial sequences of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (808 bp) of 62 loggerhead turtles collected in Korean foraging grounds (East, West, South, and Jeju Seas) between 2014 and 2022 to determine their genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and rookery origins. The sampled loggerhead turtles had 5 haplotypes, with haplotype diversity of 0.439 +/- 0.075 and nucleotide diversity of 0.00228 +/- 0.00052, which originated from 3 Northwest Pacific management units (MUs): Ryukyu Islands (RYI), Yakushima Island (YAK), and mainland Japan (MLJ). In distance-rookery size-weighted mixed stock analysis, mean (+/- SD) contributions of sampled loggerhead turtles to Korean foraging grounds were 4.2 +/- 1.6% for RYI, 71.6 +/- 16.7% for YAK, and 24.2 +/- 15.2% for MLJ. These contributions varied depending on the season and Korean feeding grounds. Our findings on the connectivity of loggerhead turtles between Korea and Japan highlight the necessity for international cooperation in their conservation.

AB  - Although reef systems are facing increasing threats from anthropogenic impacts worldwide, such as overfishing and climate change, baseline-based assessments remain scarce in the Southwestern Atlantic. Here, our objectives were: (i) to assess changes in the rocky reef fish and benthic assemblages two decades after the first assessment (2001 and 2023 baselines), and (ii) to evaluate their current overlap along the Guarapari coast, eastern Brazil. Surveys were conducted in the no-take zone of Tr & ecirc;s Ilhas (TRE), and two unprotected islands, Escalvada (ESC) and Rasas (RAS). Current data collection involved 424 underwater visual censuses and 108 photoquadrats. Substantial changes in fish abundance were observed when comparing data from 69 species between both baselines. At TRE, 27 species showed significant changes in abundance, with 19 experiencing declines, while at ESC, 38 species exhibited significant changes, including 31 declines. A notable shift in fish trophic groups was recorded, with a general increase in roving herbivorous and sessile invertebrate feeders alongside a decline in omnivorous, mobile invertivorous feeders, and carnivores. We reported a sharp reduction in the coverage of massive corals and milleporids at the TRE. Conversely, groups such as octocorals, sponges, and zoanthids experienced significant declines on both islands. Current differences between islands include higher size and abundance of commercially targeted fish, such as snappers, haemulids, and labrids, as well, higher assemblage diversity at greater distances from the coast. In conclusion, despite not having constant monitoring, baseline assessments could be valuable for identifying changes in biotic assemblages, assisting conservation efforts, and management strategies.

AB  - Increased standing macroalgal biomass in upwelling zones is generally assumed to be the result of higher nutrient flux due to upwelled waters. However, other factors can strongly impact macroalgal communities. For example, herbivory and temperature, via their effects on primary producers and the metabolic demands of consumers, can also influence macroalgal biomass and productivity, respectively. We assessed the effects of nutrient availability, temperature, and herbivory on macroalgal biomass on a subtidal nearshore rocky reef in the Galapagos Islands. We manipulated nutrient availability and herbivory in field experiments performed in two seasons: the first during a cool, upwelling season, and the second during a warm, non-upwelling season. Excluding macro-herbivores had a clear effect on standing macroalgal biomass, independent of season or nutrient availability. However, we found different interactive effects of nutrients and macro-herbivores between the two seasons. During the cool season, macroalgal biomass was significantly higher in herbivore exclusions than in open areas under ambient nutrient conditions. However, when nutrients were added, macroalgal biomass was not significantly different across all herbivore treatments, which suggests reduced top-down control of herbivores (hence a greater standing algal biomass) in open areas. In the warm season, macroalgal biomass was significantly higher in herbivore exclusions compared to open treatments, both with and without nutrient addition. Furthermore, biomass reached 2X in herbivore exclusions with nutrient additions, which hints nutrient limitation only during warm, low-upwelling conditions. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that macro-herbivores reduce macroalgal biomass in this system and suggest that nutrient availability, but not temperature, modulate herbivory.

AB  - Using geospatial data of wildlife presence to predict a species distribution across a geographic area is among the most common tools in management and conservation. The collection of high-quality presence-absence (PA) data through structured surveys is, however, expensive, and managers usually have access to larger amounts of low-quality presence-only (PO) data collected by citizen scientists, opportunistic observations and culling returns for game species. Integrated species distribution models (ISDMs) have been developed to make the most of the data available by combining the higher-quality, but usually scarcer and more spatially restricted, PA data with the lower-quality, unstructured, but usually more extensive PO datasets. Joint-likelihood ISDMs can be run in a Bayesian context using integrated nested laplace approximation methods that allow the addition of a spatially structured random effect to account for data spatial autocorrelation. Here, we apply this innovative approach to fit ISDMs to empirical data, using PA and PO data for the three prevalent deer species in Ireland: red, fallow and sika deer. We collated all deer data available for the past 15 years and fitted models predicting distribution and relative abundance at a 25 km(2) resolution across the island. Model predictions were associated to spatial estimate of uncertainty, allowing us to assess the quality of the model and the effect that data scarcity has on the certainty of predictions. Furthermore, we checked the performance of the three species-specific models using two datasets, independent deer hunting returns and deer densities based on faecal pellet counts. Our work clearly demonstrates the applicability of spatially explicit ISDMs to empirical data in a Bayesian context, providing a blueprint for managers to exploit unexplored and seemingly unusable data that can, when modelled with the proper tools, serve to inform management and conservation policies.

AB  - Species-to-species and species-to-environment interactions are key drivers of community dynamics. Disentangling these drivers in species-rich assemblages is challenging due to the high number of potentially interacting species (the 'curse of dimensionality'). We develop a process-based model that quantifies how intraspecific and interspecific interactions, and species' covarying responses to environmental fluctuations, jointly drive community dynamics. We fit the model to reef fish abundance time series from 41 reefs of Australia's Great Barrier Reef. We found that fluctuating relative abundances are driven by species' heterogenous responses to environmental fluctuations, whereas interspecific interactions are negligible. Species differences in long-term average abundances are driven by interspecific variation in the magnitudes of both conspecific density-dependence and density-independent growth rates. This study introduces a novel approach to overcoming the curse of dimensionality, which reveals highly individualistic dynamics in coral reef fish communities that imply a high level of niche structure.

AB  - Global pressures such as climate change and habitat fragmentation have altered apex predator population sizes, spatial distributions, and trophic interactions. Consequently, this has triggered fluctuations and even restructuring of mesopredator populations. During the decades of lack of apex predators in the Helan Mountain of northwestern China, red fox (Vulpes vulpes) became dominant and persisted, leading to a classic 'mesopredator release'. This study analyzes the niche characteristics of the red fox from temporal, spatial, and dietary dimensions, aiming to elucidate the factors underlying its emergence as the sole dominant carnivore. The results indicate that the red fox exhibits nocturnal activity patterns (beta > 0.54), with activity peaks occurring around midnight (21:00-02:00). There was no temporal niche overlap with felids (Delta < 0.5), whereas the highest temporal overlap was observed with the asian badger (Delta > 0.8). Species distribution modeling (SDM) predicted that over half of the Helan Mountains (53.38 %) provides suitable habitat for the red fox, with vegetation and elevation identified as the primary determinants of its distribution. Compared with other mesopredators, the red fox exhibited the broadest vertical distribution range (1400-3500 m). The dietary profile of the red fox is omnivorous, with substantial seasonal variation in food composition; however, both dietary diversity and trophic niche breadth remained consistent across seasons. By characterizing the red fox's niche across the three dimensions, we discuss the reasons for its prominence during mesopredator release. Furthermore, this study provides direct evidence of the ecological mechanisms driving mesopredator release within terrestrial 'island' habitat contexts. It also offers a generalizable predictive framework applicable to other closed, small- to medium-sized protected areas with similar habitat characteristics.

AB  - Key message We test the potential benefits of planting 2-year vs. 1-year-old seedlings to restore Mediterranean oak-dominated systems. Planting 2-year-old Quercus suber L. seedlings is recommended for improved survival and resilience against wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) and drought in dry sandy soils. The removal of acorns in seedlings did not apparently influence leaf biochemical traits and could reduce wild boar damage, particularly in 1-year-old seedlings. Context In the face of anthropogenic global change, Mediterranean oak-dominated ecosystems confront increased biotic (ungulate herbivory) and abiotic (drought) stressors, compromising forest regeneration. Restoration measures are imperative to address this scenario. Aims This study assesses the impact of different mitigation measures on the survival and biochemical traits of two oak species. Methods We planted Quercus ilex L. and Q. suber L. seedlings in Caba & ntilde;eros and Do & ntilde;ana National Parks (Spain), subjecting them to three treatments: cotyledon/acorn removal, seedling age (1- vs. 2-year-old), and herbivore protection (fenced vs. non-fenced). Results Wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) damage peaked in winter and early spring, while drought prevailed from late spring to fall. In sandy soils, wild boar uprooted 1-year-old more often than 2-years-old seedlings (40% vs. 18%). One-year-old seedlings without acorns showed higher survival rates against wild boar only in sandy soils. The removal of acorns in seedlings did not influence plant biochemical traits. Conclusions Planting 2-year-old seedlings in sandy soils may mitigate wild boar damage and improve drought resilience. Seedling age seems more important than acorn removal against biotic and abiotic stressors although acorn removal could reduce wild boar damage in 1-year-old seedlings. Our results underscore the importance of considering multiple stressors in oak restoration strategies.

AB  - Leaf herbivory potentially affects carbon (C) and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. It is especially critical to study the leaf herbivory rates in mangroves to understand the pattern of resource changes from the detrital pathway to the grazing pathway. However, determinants of leaf herbivory rates in mangroves are poorly understood. We examined the differences in leaf herbivory rates among leaf phenotypes (sun or shade leaves), leaf ages (young or old leaves), and season (summer or winter) and investigated the relationships between the leaf herbivory rates and 12 leaf traits (including chemical, physiological, and physical/mechanical traits) in each of six communities from the seaward fringe to the inland of subtropical mangroves on Iriomote Island, southern Japan. The herbivory rates decreased from seaward to landward mangrove species, excluding one species in the landward mangroves. The herbivory rates also decreased as the concentration of condensed tannins or the tannins:nitrogen ratio increased but did not correlate with the other leaf traits. Overall, season, leaf phenotype, and leaf age had no effect on the herbivory rate. However, in the two seaward and one rhizophoraceous species, the herbivory rates were higher in summer than in winter and were affected by the leaf phenotypes. The concentration of leaf condensed tannins moderately influenced leaf herbivory, fluctuating from seaward to landward; therefore, it was one of the factors driving the grazing pathway in mangroves. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for a comprehensive appreciation of the high productivity of and nutrient cycling in mangrove forest ecosystems.

AB  - BackgroundGrazing livestock emits methane through rumen intestinal activity, however, its impact on plant growth in grassland while grazing still has not been explored in detail. Therefore, the study examined the effects of methane pulse spray (MPS), according to grazing intensity, at four grazing intensities (0, 3.6, 5.0, and 6.5 sheep<middle dot>hm- 2 yr- 1) on seed germination and seedling growth of common vetch (Vicia sativa), while two irrigation rates (35 and 53 ml d- 1) were employed to simulate the precipitation.ResultsThe study revealed significant interactions between MPS and irrigation rate on seed germination and seedling growth parameters. Under moderate MPS intensities (0.74 and 1.04 mol m- 2), seed germination rate, potential, index, and vigor index improved, especially at higher irrigation rates (53 ml d- 1). Conversely, excessive MPS (1.33 mol m- 2) inhibited particularly at the germination rate and growth,. The seedling growth dynamics fitted a logistic model, with MPS advancing the rapid growth phase and increasing maximum growth rates.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that low to moderate levels of MPS from ruminants can promote seed germination and seedling growth of common vetch, while excessive MPS inhibits these processes. Irrigation enhances plant sensitivity to MPS, with wetter conditions (620 mm yr- 1) facilitating a more pronounced response. The findings introduce a new model elucidating plant responses to external perturbations, which can inform grazing management strategies in diverse ecosystems. In wetter regions, moderate grazing intensities may leverage MPS benefits, while arid regions require careful grazing regulation to maintain grassland-livestock balance.

AB  - Determining the factors affecting the structure of insect herbivore communities is a major challenge in ecology. Previous research demonstrated that plant defenses determine plant-herbivore associations. However, non-defensive variables may also explain why some plant species are associated with more diverse insect herbivore assemblages than others. Neotropical rolled-leaf beetles (Cephaloleia and Chelobasis) complete their life cycle inside the young rolled leaves of their host plants in the order Zingiberales. The diet breadth of each species in this assemblage is particularly well-known at our study site, La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. This study focused on the following non-defensive variables: host plant elevational and geographic range size, soil type, habitat, local abundance, plant size, and leaf size. Because plant characteristics among closely related plants are not independent, we analyzed these variables in a phylogenetic context. We detected a positive effect of leaf width on rolled-leaf beetle species richness (explaining 55% of the variation), abundance (28% of the variation and 57% when habitat is included in the model), diversity (37% of the variation), and community structure (6% of the variation, and 21%-26% when taxonomic family is included in the model). Our study demonstrates that Zingiberales leaf width influences positively rolled-leaf beetle species richness, abundance, and diversity. This effect varies among plant families. Our study shows that plant architecture plays an important role in structuring insect herbivore assemblages in Zingiberales. Our results highlight the importance of including variables beyond plant defenses to understand the ecology and evolution of plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Reintroducing locally extinct/extirpated species has been considered as an approach for restoring ecosystems. Although such projects share the same goals of rebuilding previously affected ecosystems, the overall impacts that such reintroductions generate on both ecosystems and human society, i.e., on the social -ecological system, are difficult to measure. We propose a system dynamics approach, a platform on which both natural and social scientists could collaborate to identify the social -ecological impacts of species reintroduction as well as factors that affect such decision making. We use cases in Japan to demonstrate the potential applicability of system dynamics in terms of (1) understanding the impacts of a previously reintroduced species, the Oriental Stork ( Ciconia boyciana ), and (2) predicting the impacts of reintroduction of wolves ( Canis lupus ). We present a causal loop diagram of the social and ecological effects of Oriental Stork reintroduction, and we discuss how the relationships between factors could be articulated based on empirical data and ongoing projects in Japan. The model demonstrates how local residents began to appreciate the rich biodiversity, including the Oriental Stork, following its reintroduction, and how public support toward such reintroduction enhanced further projects to reintroduce these species in different parts of Japan. A similar diagram, created to illustrate the social and ecological effects of the potential reintroduction of wolves to Japan, demonstrates how social factors such as environmental education and public attitudes could affect decision making as well as ecological factors such as predator -prey dynamics and overall biodiversity. Further, humanwolf conflicts could negatively affect the overall loop. Creating causal loop diagrams can help managers and stakeholders understand that species reintroduction projects need to be considered via an interdisciplinary approach. The models illustrate that these problems are dynamic and that the factors affecting or affected by such projects change over time, implying the importance of both the spatial and temporal scales in managing reintroduction projects.

AB  - Introduction: Domestic wildlife markets have important nutritional, medicinal, cultural, and financial significance for local communities, but the scale and diversity of wildlife trade that passes through them is also associated with negative impacts on biodiversity, poor animal welfare, and potential human health risk. To design, and monitor the effectiveness of, interventions to ameliorate such impacts, an understanding of the species sold at the markets and their purpose is required, together with a robust (and potentially flexible) baseline. Here we focus on Bel & eacute;n (the largest open wildlife market in the Peruvian Amazon) and Modelo market, in Iquitos, Peru. Methods: We surveyed wildlife products for sale at both markets approximately weekly over a year, using two different survey methods (open and discreet). To provide a baseline to support future conservation monitoring, we estimated a number of different market metrics (including indices of product availability, volume (observed per survey), and price), for the most frequently observed species 'groups', and compared indices of trade volume with daily river water levels. To provide a complete understanding of the range of species involved, we also described all threatened species recorded at the markets, the products sold, and their uses, including those that were only observed occasionally. Results: Both markets sold predominantly wild meat, and some pets; at Belen Market >30% observations were of decorative, spiritual, or medicinal products. At least 71 unique species (including mammals, reptiles, birds, and invertebrates) were observed in total. The most frequently observed species 'groups' were: lowland paca, peccaries, caiman, river turtles, boas, yellow footed tortoise, parrots, and brocket deer. 27.7% of species were threatened or Near Threatened globally or nationally but there was no evidence that discreet surveys increased their detection. Daily river water levels were positively correlated with indices of trade volume for lowland paca, caiman, and yellow-footed tortoise, and negatively correlated with indices of trade volume for parrots and river turtle eggs. Discussion: Beyond providing a comparative dataset, and insights regarding the apparent availability and value of a diversity of products (including food items, live pets, and other decorative, spiritual, and medicinal items), we suggest that simulations using these data could be used to optimize future monitoring efforts. Finally, our observations of correlations of per survey trade volumes of some species with daily river water levels in Iquitos may inform optimal time of year for species- specific surveys.

AB  - Hawaiian dryland ecosystems are important for global biodiversity conservation and contain numerous species threatened with extinction. Over the past century, wildfire frequency and size have increased dramatically because of invasion by fire-promoting non-native invasive species, greatly threatening these ecosystems. Native species restoration is a tool that can disrupt the cycle of increased fire and invasion in lowland dry forest communities, but restoration prescriptions have not been studied systematically in other dryland plant communities. We examined the restoration of three Hawaiian dryland plant communities (a high-productivity Diospyros sandwicensis and Metrosideros polymorpha lowland dry forest (HP), a moderate-productivity Myoporum sandwicense and Sophora chrysophylla dry forest/woodland (MP), and a low-productivity Dodonaea viscosa shrubland (LP)), using a community-assembly framework to understand the abiotic and biotic constraints to species establishment and growth in each community. Because active restoration methods are often needed, at both high and low levels of productivity, we also examined restoration treatments and outcomes across the three sites, which spanned a gradient of rainfall and substrate age. At each site, we used the same factorial field experiment with three factors: habitat quality (high or low), weed control (yes or no), and species addition (none, seeding, or outplanting). Outplants (cohort 1) and seeds were added in the winter of 2009-2010, and outplants were added again in March 2011 (cohort 2). Dispersal limitation was apparent at the LP and HP sites, but was not observed in the MP site, which had, overall, greater native diversity and abundance. Outplant survival was greater in high-quality habitats at the HP site, likely due to reduced abiotic stress. Invasive species were found in greater abundance in certain types of microsites at the LP and MP sites, suggesting that shade or topography can be used to plan restoration and weed-control activities. Overall, active restoration methods improved restoration outcomes at the high- and low-productivity sites, and less so at the moderately productive site. Weed removal and outplanting were effective restoration prescriptions at the LP and HP sites, and habitat quality could also be used to increase survival at the HP site. Active restoration could be a lower priority for moderately invaded, moderate-productivity communities, which have the capability to maintain a native ecosystem state.

AB  - The dual mandate for many protected areas (PAs) to simultaneously promote recreation and conserve biodiversity may be hampered by negative effects of recreation on wildlife. However, reports of these effects are not consistent, presenting a knowledge gap that hinders evidence-based decision-making. We used camera traps to monitor human activity and terrestrial mammals in Golden Ears Provincial Park and the adjacent University of British Columbia Malcolm Knapp Research Forest near Vancouver, Canada, with the objective of discerning relative effects of various forms of recreation on cougars (Puma concolor), black bears (Ursus americanus), black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus), snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and bobcats (Lynx rufus). Additionally, public closures of the study area associated with the COVD-19 pandemic offered an unprecedented period of human-exclusion through which to explore these effects. Using Bayesian generalized mixed-effects models, we detected negative effects of hikers (mean posterior estimate = -0.58, 95% credible interval [CI] -1.09 to -0.12) on weekly bobcat habitat use and negative effects of motorized vehicles (estimate = -0.28, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.05) on weekly black bear habitat use. We also found increased cougar detection rates in the PA during the COVID-19 closure (estimate = 0.007, 95% CI 0.005 to 0.009), but decreased cougar detection rates (estimate = -0.006, 95% CI -0.009 to -0.003) and increased black-tailed deer detection rates (estimate = 0.014, 95% CI 0.002 to 0.026) upon reopening of the PA. Our results emphasize that effects of human activity on wildlife habitat use and movement may be species- and/or activity-dependent, and that camera traps can be an invaluable tool for monitoring both wildlife and human activity, collecting data even when public access is barred. Further, we encourage PA managers seeking to promote both biodiversity conservation and recreation to explicitly assess trade-offs between these two goals in their PAs.

AB  - Lichens produce various carbon-based secondary compounds (CBSCs) in response to abiotic conditions and herbivory. Although lichen CBSCs have received considerable attention with regard to responses to UV-B exposure, very little is known about intra-specific variation across environmental gradients and their role in protection against herbivory in the Antarctic. Here we report on the variation in CBSCs of two widely distributed and common Antarctic lichens, Usnea antarctica and Umbilicaria antarctica, between sites with different solar exposure (NW-SE) and along natural nitrogen (N) gradients which are associated with changing lichen-invertebrate associations on Signy Island (South Orkney Islands, maritime Antarctic). Fumarprotocetraric and usnic acid concentrations in Usnea showed no relationships with solar exposure, lichen-N or associated invertebrate abundance. However, fumarprotocetraric acid concentration was 13 times higher at inland sites compared to coastal sites along the N-gradients. Gyrophoric acid concentration in Umbilicaria was 33% lower in sun-facing (northerly exposed) habitats compared to more shaded (south-facing) rocks and declined with elevation. Gyrophoric acid concentration was positively correlated with the abundance and species richness of associated microarthropods, similar to the patterns found with lichen N. This initial investigation indicates that there can be large intraspecific variation in lichen CBSC concentrations across relative short distances (< 500 m) on Signy Island and raises further questions regarding current understanding of the role of CBSCs in Antarctic lichens in relation to biotic and abiotic pressures.

AB  - The context-depency of biological invasions makes it difficult to understand why some species become succesfull invaders and others not. Such understanding requires studying closely-related invasive and non-invasive alien taxa sharing the same introduction history in the same environment. We identified this unusual situation in Kenya where the individuals that founded invasive Prosopis juliflora and non-invasive P. pallida populations are still present in original plantations. We evaluated field-measured traits, conducted glasshouse experiments simulating different nitrogen and water availability treatments, and did reciprocal transplants to compare functional traits and plasticity between the founders of both species (i.e. 'invasive-non-invasive congeners' comparison), and between P. juliflora individuals from plantations and invaded sites (i.e. testing for rapid evolution during invasion). We found that planted individuals of P. julifora and P. pallida differed in a number of key traits related to performance and spread (root:shoot ratio, number of stems and susceptibility to seed damage) as well as in levels of phenotypic plasticity in growth responses to resource availability, which may explain their differential invasiveness. Offspring of invasive P. juliflora individuals had higher seed mass and production, germination, survival, produced more stems, matured earlier and had higher plasticity compared with those of founder individuals, indicative of rapid post-introduction evolution. By using this exceptional study system, we show that differences in values of only a few key traits, increased phenotypic plasticity and post-introduction evolution have all contributed to the success of P. juliflora as an invasive species in Kenya.

AB  - Anthropogenic change has increased extinction events to an estimated 100 times background rates, amplifying the need for conservation interventions to protect biodiversity. Rare plant research not only provides roadmaps for species protection, but also foundational understanding of how interacting stressors drive decline and the mechanisms by which extinctions occur. Pectis imberbis (Gray) is a recently listed endangered forb found in the biodiverse Sky Island Archipelago in the southwestern U.S. We investigated both intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of decline for this species by relating multiple stressors to vital rates calculated for the nine known P. imberbis populations of sufficient size to allow for demographic analysis. We observed an extraordinary recruitment event in 2022 and concomitantly high population growth across most populations. Despite this, long-term analysis reveals that only two populations have growth rates at or above replacement levels and indicates the importance of stochastic recruitment events in maintaining viability. Climate change is implicated in decline of P. imberbis, though evidence also suggests that browse by ungulates and competition with co-occurring plants depress vital rates. Conservation recommendations vary by population, due to positionality and jurisdictional management, but include reduction of co-occurring stressors, like installing fencing to prevent herbivory, and re-establishment of P. imberbis in climatically suitable areas. Long-term demographic monitoring of this species is warranted to quantify the contribution of stochastic events to viability, examine impacts of interacting stressors, and to project how populations will respond to climate change in this arid, biodiverse region.

AB  - Cross-ecosystem nutrient fluxes can influence recipient food webs, including both static measures of structure and dynamic measures of function. However, a mechanistic basis for how nutrient subsidies affect both structure and function across multiple trophic levels is still lacking. Here, we investigate how nutrient subsidies provided by seabirds influence coral reefs, focusing on the link between primary producers and primary consumers. We quantified turf algal cover and herbivorous fish biomass (static metrics of structure), as well as productivity of turf algae and herbivorous fish (dynamic metrics of function) at sites in the inner Seychelles with a range of seabird densities due to different rat invasion histories. Turf algae grew faster with increasing amounts of seabird-derived nutrients. These higher rates of primary productivity, in turn, fueled higher productivity and biomass of herbivorous fishes. In contrast, seabird-derived nutrients did not increase cover of turf algae nor did turf algal cover affect herbivores. Instead, seabird nutrients indirectly enhanced herbivorous fish productivity and biomass via effects on primary productivity, which, in turn, led to increased top-down control by herbivores to limit turf algal cover. Overall, dynamic metrics better revealed the flow and effects of seabird-derived nutrients through coral-reef food chains and revealed the mechanisms by which seabirds can enhance coral-reef ecosystem function. These findings could be used to predict the benefits of removing introduced rats from islands, which can increase seabird populations and restore nutrient connectivity, thus potentially enhancing ecosystem function across multiple trophic levels on coral reefs.

AB  - This paper presents the study of modern pollen analogs from the Balearic Islands. While similar studies have been largely applied to mainland areas, research focused on modern vegetation dynamics on Mediterranean islands remains very rare. In this research, we combine vegetation surveys, pollen analysis and multivariate statistics to understand landscape composition. The main objectives of are: (1) to examine pollen-vegetation relationships in relation to environmental and land-use variables; (2) to understand modern pollen representation in a mosaic landscape structure; and (3) to propose pollen indicators that characterize the primary vegetation types from the Balearic Islands to better interpret past pollen records in Mediterranean island environments. Pollen results and Redundancy Analysis (RDA) distinguish three major groups: (a) Holm oak and box formations; (b) maquis and garrigues; and (c) anthropogenic and open habitats. Landscape form, mean decadal rainfall, mean decadal temperature, fire activity, trampling, slope percentage, wet/flooded soil, saline soil, distance to agropastoral cells, gHM index, domestic herbivory presence, agropastoral use, and soil type are the major variables explaining modern pollen assemblage variation in our research. Poaceae undiff., Plantago sp., Apiaceae undiff., Cerealia-t, and Cichorieae are highly correlated to human activities but should be interpreted cautiously when occurring in low values. Quercus ilex-t, Hypericum, and Buxus are correlated to humid locations while Pistacia, Pinus, Juniperus-t, and Olea to high mean decadal temperatures. Our study indicates how pollen analysis and multivariate analysis are powerful tools for characterizing the mosaic landscape, with special focus on the main vegetation types of the Balearic Islands.

AB  - In the light of future ocean warming scenarios and habitat fragmentation, coastal fishes must adjust their physiological and behavioral traits to face the combined effect of global warming and ecological interactions. Seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) are charismatic fishes with peculiar life cycle traits, which make them vulnerable to several anthropic pressures and natural disturbances. In this study, we investigated the behavior of two sympatric seahorse species, the long-snouted Hippocampus guttulatus (Cuvier, 1829) and the short-snouted Hippocampus hippocampus (Linnaeus, 1758). Specifically, we carried out two manipulative experiments to assess (i) the effect of temperature and habitat availability on both H. hippocampus and H. guttulatus behavior and (ii) the effect of temperature and an increased density of H. guttulatus (by 3x) on the activity level of congeneric species H. hippocampus. Our results showed that +3 & DEG;C warming did not affect seahorse behavior in both experiments, suggesting greater behavioral tolerance to thermal variation. However, a significant reduction of the active behavior of H. hippocampus was observed when the artificial habitat was introduced in the tank, while H. guttulatus maintained its activity. Furthermore, a significant decrease of the H. hippocampus activity was observed with an increased relative dominance of H. guttulatus. Our results suggest that both increased density of H. guttulatus and habitat availability, but not ocean warming, will affect the behavior of H. hippocampus. Therefore, different interspecific behavioral strategies may occur, thus affecting the distribution of the two species among shallow habitats when they occur in sympatry.

   Worldwide, ecosystems are collapsing or in danger of collapse, but the precise causes of these collapses are often unknown. Observational and experimental evidence shows that all ecosystems are characterized by strong interactions between and among species, and that these webs of interactions can be important contributors to the preservation of ecosystem diversity. But many of the interactions-such as those involving pathogenic microorganisms and the chemical defenses that are mounted by their prey-are not easily identified and analyzed in ecosystems that may have hundreds or thousands of species. Here we use our equal-area-annulus analytical method to examine census data from over three million trees in forest plots from around the world. We show how the method can be used to flag pairs and groups of species that exhibit unusual levels of interaction and that are likely on further investigation to yield information about their causative mechanisms. We give a detailed example showing how some of these interactions can be traced to defense mechanisms that are possessed by one of the tree species. We explore how our method can be used to identify the between-species interactions that play the largest roles in the maintenance of ecosystems and their diversity.
   When Darwin visited the Galapagos archipelago, he observed that, in spite of the islands' physical similarity, members of species that had dispersed to them recently were beginning to diverge from each other. He postulated that these divergences must have resulted primarily from interactions with sets of other species that had also diverged across these otherwise similar islands. By extrapolation, if Darwin is correct, such complex interactions must be driving species divergences across all ecosystems. However, many current general ecological theories that predict observed distributions of species in ecosystems do not take the details of between-species interactions into account. Here we quantify, in sixteen forest diversity plots (FDPs) worldwide, highly significant negative density-dependent (NDD) components of both conspecific and heterospecific between-tree interactions that affect the trees' distributions, growth, recruitment, and mortality. These interactions decline smoothly in significance with increasing physical distance between trees. They also tend to decline in significance with increasing phylogenetic distance between the trees, but each FDP exhibits its own unique pattern of exceptions to this overall decline. Unique patterns of between-species interactions in ecosystems, of the general type that Darwin postulated, are likely to have contributed to the exceptions. We test the power of our null-model method by using a deliberately modified data set, and show that the method easily identifies the modifications. We examine how some of the exceptions, at the Wind River (USA) FDP, reveal new details of a known allelopathic effect of one of the Wind River gymnosperm species. Finally, we explore how similar analyses can be used to investigate details of many types of interactions in these complex ecosystems, and can provide clues to the evolution of these interactions.

AB  - In 1980 and 1981, eight and nine individual sika deer Cervus nippon were reintroduced in southern Hokkaido, Japan, respectively, to address population declines in this species during 1900s. As recent population growth has led to human-wildlife conflicts, this study investigated the responses of sika deer to resource availability and geomorphic factors during the summer and winter seasons in southern Hokkaido. Global positioning system-collared data collected from 2016 to 2018 were used to assess the home range patterns and habitat selection of 14 female sika deer located in Mount Esan and Shiriuchi. The core home range size was defined using a 50% kernel density estimation that indicated a larger home range in winter than summer for all deer. Habitat selection was assessed using generalized linear mixed models. The results showed variation in habitat selection between resident deer of Mount Esan and Shiriuchi, as well as migratory deer in Shiriuchi during summer. Resident deer in Mount Esan and Shriuchi preferred areas closer to crops during summer. Interaction effects revealed that migratory deer utilized natural grassland close to forest edge habitat in Shiriuchi. By contrast, resident deer in Shiriuchi selected forest edge habitat and natural grasslands close to crops. In winter, low elevation was the most important habitat factor for all deer across the study area. Thus, sika deer habitat selection depends on resource availability in summer and topographic factors in the winter.

T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT

KW  - BACTERIAL
KW  - DIVERSITY
AB  - Agricultural ecosystems are continuously exposed to exogenous phages, including those introduced via animal manure fertilization, yet their colonization dynamics and ecological impacts remain unclear. Using a microcosm experiment, we investigated how pig manure-derived nanosized microbiome (NSM; <0.22 mu m) influences phage-bacterial interactions, antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) dissemination, and microbial evolution in paddy soil. NSM addition transiently elevated high-risk ARG abundance, particularly linked to Acinetobacter proliferation from manure. These dynamics were driven by manure-derived Acinetobacter and their associated phages/plasmids, which dominated soil phage communities despite their low initial abundance. Both Acinetobacter and their phages exhibited microdiversity shifts under environmental fluctuations, with strong native soil phage-bacterial correlations disrupted post-NSM introduction. Our findings highlight the environmental risks of pig manure-derived NSM, emphasizing Acinetobacter and their phages as key drivers of high-risk ARG spread and microbial community evolution. This underscores the need for manure pretreatment strategies to mitigate soil resistome hazards.

AB  - Populations of feral goats Capra hircus Linnaeus, 1758, descended from escaped or released domesticates, are widespread in the islands of Greece. Although they behave like truly wild goats, many of these animals belong to someone and are exploited by their owner(s) primarily as a source of low-cost but high-value meat. While poachers also kill some of these animals for domestic consumption, many owners capture larger groups alive in traps or drives and then release most females but retain most males for sale to urban butchers. Apart from the status of many feral goats as private property, the distinction between such animals and nearby domestic herds is often obscured by the escape or release of domesticates, by the capture and taming of feral individuals, and by the provision of water and perhaps fodder to discourage feral groups from dispersing. Using information from interviews with herders and trappers, supplemented by first-hand observations, we first describe the formation, behaviour and management of recent feral goat populations on the southern Greek islands of Crete, Kythera and Proti. Although the radical changes in rural demography and land use of recent decades have facilitated the expansion of feral goat populations, the mass capture of these animals by trapping or driving is clearly not a recent innovation. We then discuss possible lessons from these observations for the formation of feral populations and for the management of wild, feral and domestic goats in prehistory.

AB  - California, USA, is home to 3 subspecies of North American elk (Cervus canadensis): Roosevelt (C. c. roosevelti), Rocky Mountain (C. c. nelsoni), and tule (C. c. nannodes). Effective management requires a baseline understanding of each subspecies' range, admixture zones, and geographic patterns of genetic diversity. To address these questions, we genotyped 1,271 individual elk from California (n = 1,204) and reference populations of Rocky Mountain and Roosevelt elk from Nevada (n = 32) and Oregon (n = 35), USA. Using 19 polymorphic microsatellite loci, we detected admixture between Roosevelt and Rocky Mountain elk at a contact zone in northern California, and between Roosevelt and tule elk in north-coastal California and central-coastal California. We identified a genetically distinct population of Roosevelt elk in northwestern California, likely reflecting the remnant population that survived a large demographic decline from overhunting during the 1800s. Tule elk exhibited lower levels of heterozygosity (0.44 +/- 0.03 [SD]) and allelic richness (2.9 +/- 0.2) than Rocky Mountain (0.58 +/- 0.05, 4.9 +/- 0.4, respectively) and Roosevelt (0.50 +/- 0.06, 4.4 +/- 0.6, respectively) elk. Among tule elk populations, heterozygosity varied, with the lowest heterozygosity (0.23 +/- 0.05) corresponding to the oldest enclosed herd used over the past century as a source of translocations. Among tule elk populations, genetic structure revealed several cases of successful and unsuccessful reintroduction or augmentation attempts. Results provide an essential baseline for future monitoring and decisions about harvest management, translocations to preserve genetic diversity, and landscape-level conservation planning to maintain, enhance, or obstruct connectivity of elk populations. Genome-wide sequencing and analyses are needed to quantify inbreeding absolutely and assess genetic load and the age of admixture where subspecies currently exchange genes.

AB  - The temporal and spatial variation of a benthic brachyuran assemblage in Sao Paulo, Brazil, showing patterns possibly explainable by various environmental factors: water temperature and salinity, organic matter and sediment texture was investigated. Samples were collected near the areas with unconsolidated substrates close to Couves (CO) and Mar Virado (MV) Islands, Ubatuba coast, Sao Paulo State, over a period of two years (January 1998-December 1999). Monthly sample collections were performed using a shrimp fishing boat equipped with a double-rig trawl. Temperature and bottom water salinity were measured monthly, whereas organic matter and sediment texture was measured seasonally. Environmental variables were compared among islands, seasons, and years using Permutational Analysis of Variance (Permanova) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) analyses. Total Brachyura abundance was compared among islands, seasons, and years. For each island (CO and MV) the abundance was related to environmental variables, seasons, and years through Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS). In total, 2,109 samples were collected (1,021 in 1998 and 1,088 in 1999). The most abundant species were Hexapanopeus paulensis in CO and Callinectes ornatus in MV. The abundance of crabs was lower in CO than in MV. Such observations can be explained by the strong influence of oceanographic and continental events on CO. The reduced hydrodynamics at MV could promote fine sediment gathering and explain the homogeneous physicochemical characteristics of the area. Hence, different conditions can modulate species composition and abundance. This study provides information on the combination of modulating variables in benthic communities of brachyurans.

AB  - Rewilding can play a vital role in safeguarding biodiversity, with the grazing pressure exerted by large ungulates and controlled by their predators being a significant factor, particularly in European contexts. Domestic horses are becoming integral to such ungulates' biomass, but they may differ from truly wild species due to their domesticated origin. This raises concerns about whether feral horses retain adequate antipredator behaviours, especially in the presence of expanding, large predators like wolves. The field of antipredator behaviour research is hampered by inconsistent results and a lack of standardisation, and the behaviour of free-ranging horses remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a playback experiment on semi-feral Exmoor ponies (n = 97) in the Czech Republic, exposing them to wolf howls, deer rut calls, and static noise as a control. We assessed alert behaviour and herd grouping while accounting for variables such as herd size, sex, time of day, weather conditions, environment type, presence of other ungulates, and habituation effects. Over 70% of the ponies exhibited alert behaviour in response to both wolf and deer calls. Although the magnitude of responses did not differ significantly between wolf and deer calls, both elicited distinct reactions compared to the control. Most of the studied external factors significantly affected the observed alert responses, highlighting that they must be carefully considered in such studies since these may explain the conflicting results observed in previous studies. The significant behavioural differences in reaction to the sounds indicate that the horses can differentiate them and likely still possess some innate memory, as reported in other ungulates. This is a positive sign towards reintroduction. Future research should carefully consider the validity of the testing environment, habituation effects, and other external factors to ensure robust results.

AB  - Tropical macroalgal habitats are often overlooked or perceived as degraded reef states, yet they contribute to reef habitat diversity and provide important ecological functions including supply of nutritional resources for a diverse suite of reef fishes. Understanding how reef fishes use macroalgal habitats is critical for appreciating their importance in tropical seascapes. We investigated which components of natural macroalgal habitats are selectively used by reef fishes in natural macroalgal beds across three sites on an inshore reef on Orpheus Island, Great Barrier Reef. We quantified benthic composition and feeding behaviour of reef fishes within 1 m2 quadrats across the three sites, with feeding behaviour quantification based on remote underwater video. Small bodied and/or juvenile herbivorous fish dominated the foraging assemblage, particularly juvenile Siganus doliatus and parrotfishes. Notably, seven of the eight most commonly observed fish taxa exhibited strong and consistent positive feeding electivity for canopy macroalgae over all other microhabitats (i.e., understorey algae, turfs and sand). This clear pattern of selective feeding highlights the important functional role of canopy macroalgae in structuring reef trophic interactions and indicates non-random microhabitat use by foraging fishes. In contrast, multivariate and univariate analyses indicated that benthic composition and macroalgal structure were poor predictors of feeding rates of the dominant feeding fishes. These results indicate that although small-bodied fishes selectively targeted macroalgal canopies, feeding rates were not simply limited by the availability and physical structure, inviting further investigation of additional ecological drivers. Our findings underscore the importance of macroalgal habitats in tropical seascapes and challenge the perception that they are ecologically impoverished or merely symptomatic of degradation.

AB  - Rana uenoi, a common brown frog inhabiting South Korea and the Japanese Tsushima Island, has a long history of taxonomic discussion. Although R. uenoi was described in 2014 as being distinct from R. dybowskii, the taxonomic status and distribution of the South Korean clade of R. uenoi has remained uncertain, particularly with respect to the related species R. dybowskii. Considering the species' importance as a biological indicator of climate change, resolving the taxonomic equivocacy and clarifying its genetic structure is a matter of urgency. To do this, we included samples from across its distribution in South Korea, sequenced and analyzed Cytochrome b sequences, and developed novel microsatellite markers for population genetic analyses. Our phylogenetic analyses verified the absence of R. dybowskii or another species in South Korea and confirmed the genetic divergence between R. uenoi and R. dybowskii. Population genetic analyses showed two distinct groups within R. uenoi, one on the Korean mainland and Japanese Tsushima Island and the second on Jeju Island, with the likely scenario being the Jeju Island population originating from mainland Korea during the Pleistocene. Demographically, we found evidence of population bottleneck events. Based on these results, we propose the English common name "Korean large brown frog" and a Korean common name "(SIC)" [keun-san-gaeguri] for R. uenoi. These results provide an important baseline data for understanding future climate change impacts. Key words. Amphibia, Anura, Ranidae, Rana uenoi, R. dybowskii, brown frogs, taxonomic

AB  - Ensemble ecosystem models (EEMs) are powerful tools for assessing the impacts of ecological management decisions made under uncertainty. However, their simplicity means they can omit finer-scale spatial interactions and individual-level behaviours, potentially limiting the "what if" scenario experiments available to managers and the ability of EEMs to replicate observed dynamics in relatively data-rich case studies. In this article, we introduce a spatial agent-based model (ABM) to explore the benefits of integrating a more complex model into the EEM framework. The ABM-EEM is used to assess the impacts of rewilding at the Knepp Estate, UK, and predict future ecosystem states under various management intervention scenarios. A wide range of questions is explored, for example, how have species reintroductions impacted the ecosystem, and how might they continue to in the future? What is the chance of wood-pasture habitats being maintained in the long term? Can the addition of new species or changes to stocking densities affect this probability? The ABM-EEM approach had several advantages. Compared with a previous EEM of Knepp, calibrating the ABM-EEM was more efficient and identified a wider range of acceptable outputs. Incorporating space and individual-level dynamics enabled a more nuanced evaluation of the possible impacts of hypothetical European bison or elk reintroductions, and it revealed an emergent behaviour: woodland regenerated more frequently in thorny scrubland when large herbivores were present. Practical implication. While the ABM-EEM approach comes with disadvantages such as higher computational demands and reduced transparency, it shows promise for conservation planning and decision-making, particularly for relatively data-rich case studies that may require a more complex model.

AB  - The ultimate goal of threatened plant translocations is to establish self-sustaining populations. Lessons learnt from plant translocations can inform future translocations and improve conservation outcomes via adaptive management. We assessed translocation success for 76 translocations of 50 species established as part of recovery programmes between 1998 and 2016 in the Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR), a biodiversity hotspot with Mediterranean-type climate. We used a series of Bayesian hierarchical models to assess translocation success as measured by plant survival, height growth, crown growth, and reproduction (flowering and fruiting). We found that fencing to prevent vertebrate herbivory improved survival, irrigating plants over the first two summer dry periods improved the likelihood of reproduction, and where the rainfall increased above the 30-year average in the two years following planting, it positively influenced survival, growth, and reproduction. We recommend that fencing to prevent herbivory should be broadly considered in threatened plant translocations, while irrigation to improve translocation success would benefit plant species in Mediterranean-type ecosystems and other dryland environments.

AB  - Wildlife translocation is increasingly utilized as a conservation management action, to mitigate the immediate negative effects of habitat loss and fragmentation (e.g. from land clearing or bushfires). Previous research has shown that stress responses can help or hinder survival in translocated wildlife and determine the efficacy of translocation as a conservation action. Yet these translocated animals are only one side of the equation, with translocation also potentially impacting the animals in the recipient population. We measured physiological markers of stress (faecal cortisol metabolite concentrations and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios) and assessed health condition in a wild koala population one year after a major translocation of bushfire-rescued koalas on Kangaroo Island. We expected to find a high population density at the site (>0.75 koalas per hectare) and that resident koalas would show signs of chronic stress and ill health as a result of territorial conflict over food trees and reproductive opportunities. In contrast, we found that only one-fifth of the population remaining at the site were translocated koalas. The overall population density was also much lower (0.21 koalas per hectare) than anticipated. With no evidence of mass mortality at the site, we suggest that the majority of translocated koalas dispersed away from the site. Our stress marker measurements did not differ between the wild koalas and a sample of captive (non-display) koalas at the nearby Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park and were generally low compared to other studies. Veterinary examinations found that most koalas were in good body condition with very few diagnostic indicators of systemic ill health. Overall, our results suggest that, if there is adequate landscape-scale habitat connectivity and opportunity for dispersal, translocated koalas are likely to disperse from the site of release, with limited impacts on recipient koala populations at translocation release sites.

AB  - Introduction: Polylepis forest is an ecosystem stated with conservation priority and threatened by anthropogenic effects; extensive livestock is one of the most frequent disturbances.
   Objective: To study the effect of livestock on the early stages of regeneration of a quenoa (Polylepis australis Bitt.) forest.
   Materials and methods: Within a pure forest of P. australis at Parque Provincial Potrero de Yala, Jujuy, Argentina, densities of seedlings (<1 year) and saplings (>1 year and <30 cm) were measured in the presence (0.23 heads.ha(-1)) and absence of livestock, for a year. Linear mixed models (normal distribution) were adjusted for density of seedlings and saplings. Data was analyzed with a Chi-square test (X-2).
   Results and discussion: Presence of livestock had no impact on seedling density, but significantly decreased density of saplings (P < 0.001); in areas without livestock (10.58 +/- 6.64 individuals.m(-2)) was three times higher than with presence of livestock (3.17 +/- 3.86 individuals.m(-2)). Difference in density of seedlings and saplings was significantly (P < 0.001) over time. This indicates that there is potential for natural regeneration, but livestock would affect stages after seedling emergence, representing a threat to the forest.
   Conclusion: This study provides important information on livestock management in mountain forests of P. australis. A long-term study of the effect of livestock on seedling and sapling density, and over the entire distribution range, is needed.

AB  - Restoration of keystone species, such as large herbivores, is crucial in repairing natural process in ecosystems and responding to the global biodiversity loss. These efforts however face many ecological, social and political challenges. In the context of the on-going update of the IUCN European Bison Action Plan this paper examines conservation discourses that are crucial for understanding challenges and opportunities in bison reintroduction and species restoration in general. The European bison was almost exterminated before many organizations' efforts to save it in the 20th century. Although the history of bison has been a conservation success story, currently there is an urgent need for innovative solutions to accommodate its growing population on the densely populated continent. There are numerous points of disagreements among bison conservationists, such as the degree of human intervention, ethical consideration regarding hunting, the uses of various types of knowledge in decision-making, and finding conflict-free spaces for bison in contemporary European landscapes. This study systematically explores the various perspectives of experts from 18 countries regarding the priorities for European bison conservation. To this end, we applied Q-method online survey targeting scientists and wildlife managers. We identified three perspectives on the bison conservation: 'participatory conservation of an iconic species', 'stewardship and control of vulnerable bison', and 'hands-off approach for restoring bison ecology'. The identified discourses show how bison conservation is evolving from traditional conservation narratives based on distinction between intrinsic and instrumental values towards innovative ideas inspired by rewilding narratives. However, the dilemmas of human-bison coexistence remain.

AB  - The Kangaroo Island glossy black-cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus lathami halmaturinus) is an endangered subspecies that feeds almost entirely on the kernels of drooping sheoak (Allocasuarina verticillata). Hence, it is highly susceptible to changes in the quantity or quality of A. verticillata. Fire has the potential to severely impact glossy black-cockatoo feeding habitat on the island, but since A. verticillata is serotinous, it is partially reliant on fire for regeneration. Here, we quantified the effects of time-since-fire (over a 60-year period) on cone quality for C. lathami halmaturinus. Cone quality in A. verticillata woodlands with a range of fire histories was examined using three measures of cone profitability: the ratio of seed-to-cone mass (Clout's Index), the ratio of kernel-to-cone mass (Kernel Ratio) and the proportion of seeds containing kernels (Seed Fill). We then mapped the fire history of A. verticillata woodlands on Kangaroo Island before and after the 2019/20 bushfire season. We found that time-since-fire had a significant negative impact on Clout's Index, as well as a negative but non-significant impact on Seed Fill and Kernel Ratio. This suggests that trees that have not experienced fire in over 60 years may have cones that are of lesser value to C. lathami halmaturinus. This is concerning, because up to 94% of A. verticillata woodlands not impacted by the 2019/20 bushfires are likely of a similar age class, having had no fire in over 60 years. Our findings highlight the need for ongoing assessment and management of critical habitat for this endangered subspecies. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. CC_BY_NC_ND_4.0

AB  - Herbivory is a key ecological process that often determines the composition and abundance of plants. Estimates of herbivory in seagrass meadows are typically lower than those in other vegetated coastal ecosystems, but herbivory can be intense when large herbivorous vertebrates are abundant. We surveyed rates of herbivory on 2 species of tropical seagrasses (Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides), the abundance of herbivorous vertebrates, and the diet of 2 abundant herbivorous vertebrates (the green turtle Chelonia mydas and the rabbitfish Siganus lineatus) in lagoons adjacent to remote islands off northwestern Australia. Rates of herbivory in some deployments of tethered seagrass were more than 1000 times higher than rates of production and were among the highest recorded. Consumption exceeded production in half the deployments (9 of 18). Remote underwater video revealed that S. lineatus was the most abundant herbivore. Stomachs of S. lineatus contained mostly seagrass, and models based on stable isotopes indicated that seagrass was the primary source of nutrition. Stomach contents of C. mydas were more variable, containing seagrass and macroalgae (although the sample size was low), but models based on stable isotopes indicated that seagrass was likely the primary source of nutrition. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the high rates of herbivory on the seagrasses T. hemprichii and E. acoroides are mainly due to direct consumption by the abundant S. lineatus, and perhaps also C. mydas. Seagrass is the primary contributor to the nutrition of both species.

AB  - We recorded the occurrence of Duranta erecta L. in the Aeolian Islands (Sicily, Italy), where it currently behaves as a casual alien. At the global scale, however, this woody species has shown highly invasive behaviour in different island ecosystems. On the basis of this evidence, we have investigated which ecological and biological traits may have allowed its establishment and spread, and could trigger its further expansion in the Aeolian Islands in the near future. Several factors seem to have favoured its success on a global scale, such as the wide edaphic and climatic range, the tolerance to anthropogenic disturbance, and the production of toxic metabolites that protect it from herbivore browsing and from competition with other plants. The study of the organisms that perform pollination and seed dispersal is probably the key to understanding the local naturalization of this plant, introduced about three centuries ago in Europe and the Mediterranean, and is here discussed in detail for the first time.

AB  - Background Dataset of annual monitoring of herbivory effects on the conservation status of the endangered species Androcymbium europaeum (Lange) K. Richt and its associated plant communities is presented in this manuscript. This dataset encompasses the annual monitoring of herbivory effects on the conservation status of the endangered species Androcymbium europaeum. Since 2010, the SERPAM Department (Service of Evaluation, Restoration and Protection of Mediterranean Agrosystems) at the Zaidin Experimental Station, belonging to the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC-EEZ), has conducted annual sampling to assess the impact of both domestic and wild livestock, specifically rabbits, on the pastures where A. europaeum lives. The study consisted of a randomised block design, implementing three distinct treatments to evaluate different management strategies: (1) rabbit and domestic herbivory, (2) exclusion of domestic livestock and (3) exclusion of rabbits and domestic livestock. Within each treatment, two types of monitoring were conducted. Firstly, the abundance of A. europaeum was estimated by counting individuals within 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats. Secondly, plant species diversity was assessed along 2-m long transects using the modified Point -Quadrat method. The research was conducted within the Cabo de Gata-Nijar Natural Park in southern Spain, specifically in the Amoladeras Nature Reserve in Almeria. New information The dataset contains information spanning from 2010 to 2023, providing valuable insights into the annual monitoring of herbivory effects on the conservation status of A. europaeum, contributing to our understanding of the species' interaction with domestic and wild animal in the studied area.

AB  - Plants that bear oversized fruits, but do not co-occur with present-day large-bodied frugivores to disperse their seeds, are considered to represent seed dispersal anachronisms. It is hypothesized that these plants were originally dispersed by the megafauna that became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. Accordingly, many plant species in South America bearing the so-called megafaunal fruits occur in ecosystems lacking native modern megafauna. In Chile, Lardizabala biternata is an endemic vine that produces a large edible fruit, with a morphology suggesting a megafaunal seed dispersal syndrome. This species grows across the Chilean Winter Rainfall-Valdivian Forests and has a rather wide distribution, along which there are currently no large native vertebrates that could ingest its fruits and disperse the seeds. We hypothesized that foxes may be its present-day surrogate dispersers, because they are the only remnant mesofauna across L. biternata's range that include fruits in their diet. We collected fox scats periodically for 1 year and analyzed their contents, which revealed the presence of intact L. biternata seeds. These results suggest that foxes may be acting as present-day dispersers of this vine; however, it is unknown whether they provide effective dispersal. Our findings stress the fragmentary state of the knowledge of ecological interactions among species in Chilean ecosystems, opening new perspectives in terms of the role of terrestrial fauna in maintaining ecosystem functions.

AB  - Invasive species often exhibit disproportionately strong negative effects in their introduced range compared to their native range, and much research has been devoted to understanding the role of shared evolutionary history, or lack thereof, in driving these differences. Less studied is whether introduced species, particularly those that are important as facilitators in their native range, have persistent positive effects in their invaded range despite a lack of a shared evolutionary history with the invaded community. Here, we manipulated the density of a habitat-forming facilitator, the high intertidal acorn barnacle Balanus glandula, factorially with herbivore density in its native range (Bluestone Point, British Columbia, Canada) and invaded range (Punta Ameghino, Chubut Province, Argentina) to determine how this facilitator differentially affects associated species at these two locations. Given that high intertidal species at Punta Ameghino (PA) are evolutionarily naive to barnacles, we predicted that the positive effects of B. glandula at PA would be absent or weak compared to those at Bluestone Point (BP). However, we found that B. glandula had an equally positive effect on herbivore biomass at PA compared to BP, possibly because the moisture-retaining properties of barnacle bed habitats are particularly important in seasonally dry Patagonia. Barnacle presence indirectly decreased ephemeral algal cover at BP by increasing grazer pressure, but barnacles instead facilitated ephemeral algae at PA. In contrast, B. glandula increased perennial algal cover at BP, but generally decreased perennial algal cover at PA, likely due to differences in dominant algal morphology. Though our experiment was limited to one location on each continent, our results suggest that shared evolutionary history may not be a prerequisite for strong facilitation to occur, but rather that the nature and strength of novel species interactions are determined by the traits of associated species and the environment in which they occur.

AB  - In this paper, I examine the potential of studying living things archaeologically. I adopt and expand the term 'vivifact' first proposed by Kawa, Painter, and Murray [2015. "Trail Trees: Living Artifacts (Vivifacts) of Eastern North America." Ethnobiology Letters 6 (1): 183-188. doi:], defined in this paper as any living plant or animal the appearance, features, or distribution of which can be understood as the product of past human action. The ethical considerations required by living artefacts are discussed. Different types of living things that can be grouped under the vivifact concept are then reviewed, including culturally modified trees, patterns of vegetation growth and living populations having traits selected for by past human activity. Practical approaches are described by which archaeologists can approach these resources. Two case studies are presented from Virginia, one describing vegetation survey in a wooded landscape and one examining modern sheep populations to better understand eighteenth-century sheep. However, the techniques described could be applied anywhere in the world. I propose that vivifacts are best understood through the lens of the systems that create and maintain them. The common ground uniting all living things is that they are produced and maintained by systems, and it is the examination of these systems that can serve to create a unified archaeology of living things.

AB  - Fencing is a major anthropogenic feature affecting wildlife distributions and movements, but its impacts are difficult to quantify due to a widespread lack of spatial data. We created a fence model and compared outputs to a fence mapping approach using satellite imagery in two counties in southwest Montana, USA to advance fence data development for use in research and management. The model incorporated road, land cover, ownership, and grazing boundary spatial layers to predict fence locations. We validated the model using data collected on randomized road transects (n = 330). The model predicted similar to 34,700 km of fences with a mean fence density of 0.93 km/km(2) and a maximum density of 14.9 km/km(2). We also digitized fences using Google Earth Pro in a random subset of our study area in survey townships (n = 50). The Google Earth approach showed greater agreement (K = 0.76) with known samples than the fence model (K = 0.56) yet was unable to map fences in forests and was significantly more time intensive. We also compared fence attributes by land ownership and land cover variables to assess factors that may influence fence specifications (e.g., wire heights) and types (e.g., number of barbed wires). Private land fences had bottom wires that were closer to the ground and top wires higher from the ground when compared to fences on public lands, with sample means at similar to 22 cm and similar to 26 cm, and similar to 115 cm and similar to 111 cm, respectively. Both bottom wire means were well below recommended heights for ungulates navigating underneath fencing (>= 46 cm), while top wire means were closer to the 107 cm maximum fence height recommendation. We found that both fence type and land ownership were correlated (chi(2) = 45.52, df = 5, p = 0.001) as well as fence type and land cover type (chi(2) = 140.73, df = 15, p = 0.001). We provide tools for estimating fence locations, and our novel fence type assessment demonstrates an opportunity for updated policy to encourage the adoption of "wildlife-friendlier" fencing standards to facilitate wildlife movement in the western U.S. while supporting rural livelihoods.

AB  - Herbicides are the most applied pesticides in the world. Despite numerous laboratory studies demonstrating the toxic effect of herbicides on non-target organisms, the effect of herbicides on soil organisms in the field remains complex to understand and is still controversial. In order to understand how changes in agricultural practices aiming to reduce herbicide use could impact soil biodiversity, we studied the effect of the frequency of herbicide application on soil biodiversity in a tropical agroecosystem.Our study was conducted on banana farms in Martinique, an island with a humid tropical climate belonging to the Caribbean biodiversity hotspot. Thirteen banana plots from five different farms were selected, ranging from plots receiving no herbicides to plots receiving 4-5 applications per year. Soil macro-arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps resulting in the collection of over 6,200 individuals. Of the 100 taxa that were differentiated, 75 could be identified to species level which allowed to assign each taxon to a trophic group and when possible to classify them according to whether they were introduced or native.Macro-arthropod mean species richness was 21% lower in plots with the highest frequency of herbicide application. However, no conclusive effect of herbicides on macro-arthropod abundance was demonstrated. Mean species richness for different trophic groups also decreased with herbicide applications with decreases of 22% for predators, 17% for omnivores, 55% for herbivores, and 55% for decomposers in plots with 4-5 herbicide applications per year compared to plots with no herbicide use. Species composition of macro-arthropod com-munities varied significantly with herbicide applications. More specifically, we found that native species rep-resented a higher proportion of individuals captured in plots where no herbicides were used; suggesting that agroecological practices implemented at the field level to reduce the frequency of herbicide use potentially play a relevant role in soil biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Native sika deer (Cervus nippon) had not been observed in and around Sasebo City, Nagasaki Prefecture, Kyushu, Japan. However, deer have recently been confirmed in this area, and the number of individuals and the range have been expanding, causing damage to forestry and natural vegetation. Although the origin of these deer is unknown, it may be derived from Formosan sika deer (C. n. taiouanus), which is listed as an invasive alien species in Japan. There is concern about hybridization between this subspecies and the native Japanese sika deer. In the present study, we used genetic methods to assess the current status of the deer in the Sasebo area of Nagasaki Prefecture, particularly its origin and hybridization. Our study showed that the deer did not originate from Formosan sika deer, and we found no evidence of hybridization. The deer in the Sasebo area were found to have a haplotype included in the southern Japanese sika deer lineage. The current study was unable to identify the specific origin of the deer due to limitations in PCR-RFLP and mitochondrial DNA sequencing analysis.

AB  - Conserving species relies upon acquiring an understanding of their use of habitat, yet our understanding of the use of habitat by co-existing species of different guilds at microgeographic scales remains poor. In particular, the use of habitat by woodland species is of conservation concern because of widespread declines in woodland biodiversity. Woodland bird declines have been ascribed, in part, to high deer densities because their browsing reduces the availability of nesting sites and food. We quantify the microgeographic use of habitat by Roe Deer (Capreolus capreolus) and of Great Tits (Parus major), Blue Tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) and Pied Flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) in a heterogenous woodland landscape. We examined the use of habitat at microgeographic scales by the deer and the three bird species in relation to whether the local habitat was flat or wet or had a path, fence or wall within a 25-m radius of 206 randomly selected locations. We first examined if the occupancy rates of nestboxes in those locations were correlated with the number of Roe Deer lays and second, examined if the use of habitat by the Roe Deer and the bird species were associated with each of the habitat features that we quantified. We begin by showing that the use of habitat by Roe Deer is incongruent with the use of habitat by Great Tits, Blue Tits and Pied Flycatchers during the breeding season. Also, whilst all three bird species showed no, or weak, habitat preferences, the Roe Deer preferred daytime lay sites that were in flat areas of wet woodland close to paths, whilst there were no significant effects of the presence of fences and walls. These findings show that the Roe Deer and the three bird species differ in the use of habitat within a heterogenous woodland landscape, meaning that their use of habitat did not overlap at microgeographic scales. Meanwhile, the deer showed preferences for flat areas of wet woodland, whilst none of the bird species exhibited such preferences, and we discuss the implications of our findings for the management of woodlands.

AB  - Feral pigs represent significant threats to the environments where they are introduced, both to the native flora and fauna, as well as agriculture and production systems as vectors of disease. Despite being subject to intermittent, intensive management efforts across much of their invaded range, how feral pigs respond spatially to control programs remains poorly understood. To examine behavioural responses to short-term aerial culling (current practice), feral pigs were fitted with GPS collars in southern Queensland, Australia at two sites with aerial culling and one nil-treatment site. Using continuous time movement models and recurse analysis, changes to feral pig home range size, location, overlap between individuals, and use of cover were compared between two consecutive months, pre-and post-aerial culling, or rainfall at the nil-treatment site. Significant disturbance did not have a consistent impact on feral pig spatial behaviour in terms of home range size, location, or home range overlap between individuals. Likewise, changes in daily activity and cover use by feral pigs were not consistent in response to aerial control. This was also reflected at the site with no aerial control, where feral pig spatial behaviour varied on a month-to-month basis and was inconsistent between the examined periods. Collectively, these results indicate that aerial culling did not represent a significant enough disturbance to induce changes in feral pig spatial behaviour, and highlights the plasticity and high spatiotemporal variability of feral pig habitat use on a month-to-month basis. The findings also support the use of aerial culling to manage pig populations, particularly during exotic disease incursions where dispersal of animals to uninfected areas must be avoided.

AB  - The relationship between phytophagous insects and plants is a central aspect of food webs and ecosystem functioning. The introduction of new species into an environment can have significant impacts on the food web of a native ecosystem. In many cases, there is a lack of knowledge on the biology and feeding behavior of invasive species prior their introduction and in the invaded regions. Gut content analyses of insects have provided valuable information on the host spectrum of insects. However, current approaches are time-consuming and costly. Here, we describe a new molecular gut content analysis (GCA) approach using the Oxford Nanopore (ONT) Flongle sequencing platform to characterize the plant DNA present in the gut of the highly polyphagous insect species Halyomorpha halys. We demonstrate that this technique efficiently amplifies and correctly identifies plant DNA in a mock community. We performed a feeding experiment to determine the sensitivity of this approach and to assess how long the plant DNA can be detected. All plants used in the feeding experiment were correctly identified and detected after 56 days. Surprisingly, we also detected various plant genera that were not included in the feeding experiment and thus were likely ingested months before the experiment. Our study suggests that the GCA using the ONT Flongle sequencing platform represents a rapid and cost-efficient diagnosis of the dietary preferences, host range, and the diversity of consumed plant species of pest insects with high precision.

AB  - Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) evolved for thousands of years in the presence of numerous predators, including mountain lions (Puma concolor). Bighorn sheep have presumably developed predator avoidance strategies; however, the effectiveness of these strategies in reducing risk of mountain lion predation is not well understood. These strategies are of increasing interest because mountain lion predation on bighorn sheep has been identified as a leading cause of mortality in some sheep populations. Therefore, we investigated how mountain lions affect both bighorn sheep habitat selection and risk of mortality in Arizona, USA. We used 2 approaches to investigate the predator-prey relationship between mountain lions and bighorn sheep. We fit 103 bighorn sheep (81 females and 22 males) with global positioning system radio-collars in 2 Arizona populations from 2013 to 2017, and used a negative binomial resource selection probability function to evaluate whether bighorn sheep selected for habitat features in accordance with presumed predator avoidance strategies, including terrain ruggedness, slope, topographic position, and horizontal obstruction, in 2 seasons (winter and summer). We then estimated how habitat features such as terrain ruggedness, slope, horizontal obstruction, and group size, influence the risk of mortality due to mountain lion predation using an Andersen-Gill proportional hazards model. Generally, both sexes selected areas with lower horizontal obstruction and intermediate ruggedness and slope, but selection patterns differed between seasons and sexes. The use of more rugged areas and steeper slopes decreased the risk of mortality due to mountain lion predation, consistent with presumed predator avoidance strategies. Increased group size decreased risk of bighorn sheep mortality due to mountain lion predation but this effect became marginal at approximately 10 individuals/group. We did not identify a relationship between horizontal obstruction and bighorn sheep mortality risk. Our findings can be used in habitat and population management decisions such as the prioritization of habitat restoration sites or selection of translocation sites. In addition, we suggest that augmentation of low-density bighorn sheep populations may reduce mountain lion predation risk by increasing group size, and that releasing large groups of bighorn sheep in population augmentation and reintroduction efforts may help to reduce mountain lion predation.

AB  - Differences in the bacterial communities inhabiting mammalian gut microbiomes tend to reflect the phylogenetic relatedness of their hosts, a pattern dubbed phylosymbiosis. Although most research on this pattern has compared the gut microbiomes of host species across biomes, understanding the evolutionary and ecological processes that generate phylosymbiosis requires comparisons across phylogenetic scales and under similar ecological conditions. We analysed the gut microbiomes of 14 sympatric small mammal species in a semi-arid African savanna, hypothesizing that there would be a strong phylosymbiotic pattern associated with differences in their body sizes and diets. Consistent with phylosymbiosis, microbiome dissimilarity increased with phylogenetic distance among hosts, ranging from congeneric sets of mice and hares that did not differ significantly in microbiome composition to species from different taxonomic orders that had almost no gut bacteria in common. While phylosymbiosis was detected among just the 11 species of rodents, it was substantially weaker at this scale than in comparisons involving all 14 species together. In contrast, microbiome diversity and composition were generally more strongly correlated with body size, dietary breadth, and dietary overlap in comparisons restricted to rodents than in those including all lineages. The starkest divides in microbiome composition thus reflected the broad evolutionary divergence of hosts, regardless of body size or diet, while subtler microbiome differences reflected variation in ecologically important traits of closely related hosts. Strong phylosymbiotic patterns arose deep in the phylogeny, and ecological filters that promote functional differentiation of cooccurring host species may disrupt or obscure this pattern near the tips.

AB  - Adult green turtles are known to display either preference in their foraging habits or fidelity to their foraging sites which, in turn, influences their migrations and the availability of forage. With an abundant supply of seagrass and algae, the lagoons of the Lakshadweep Archipelago off the Indian west coast serve as significant feeding grounds for green turtles. In the last 2 decades, the numbers of foraging green turtles have varied across islands, leading to speculation about their foraging patterns and movements. We collated secondary data and conducted periodic surveys between 2013 and 2019 to record trends in green turtle abundance and seagrass characteristics and investigate relationships between them. Over the last decade, green turtle abundances have fluctuated widely with increases followed by sharp declines within different lagoons. Our results also show that a reduction in seagrass density, particularly Thalassia sp. and Cymodocea sp., coincided with the decline in green turtle abundance. Moreover, turtle presence was observed at sites with higher seagrass density and canopy height. Our findings indicate that green turtles appeared to forage in particular lagoons until their preferred resources declined, before moving to other islands within the Archipelago or other unknown locations. Therefore, to devise effective management strategies, it is crucial to understand how this green turtle population will adapt to the decline in foraging resources. The declining seagrass populations also suggest the need for an ecosystem approach towards green turtle conservation.

AB  - Dwarfed insular mammals are of significant interest to evolutionary biology because of their morphological and physiological adaptations triggered by variables inherent to geographical isolation. One life history trait that is expected to be modified in relation to body size reduction is extended longevity facilitated by ecological parameters such as predator and competitor release and fluctuating resource availability. However, systematic examination of longevity in extreme cases of dwarfism is difficult as such cases are largely represented by fossils of extinct species. We studied seven rib fragments of the extraordinary endemic Pleistocene dwarf deer Candiacervus (size 2) to test whether its bone matrix shows evidence for extensive bone remodelling typically seen in large and long-living mammals. We found that all ribs had well-remodelled Haversian bone, implying several generations of resorption and re-deposition processes. Osteon density was high relative to small bone cross-section size, with examples of porosity similar to that seen in elderly animals. We report the first combined micro-morphological and micro-morphometric record of Candiacervus rib histology, agreeing with previous literature discussing the evolutionary biology of dwarf ruminants. Further experimental validation of osteon density in extant deer will confirm whether dwarfed Candiacervus indeed lived longer than expected for its body mass.

AB  - Recent experiments have demonstrated that carnivores and ungulates in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America fear the human 'super predator' far more than other predators. Australian mammals have been a focus of research on predator naivet & eacute; because it is suspected they show atypical antipredator responses. To experimentally test if mammals in Australia also most fear humans, we quantified the responses of four native marsupials (eastern grey kangaroo, Bennett's wallaby, Tasmanian pademelon, common brushtail possum) and introduced fallow deer to playbacks of predator (human, dog, Tasmanian devil, wolf) or non-predator control (sheep) vocalizations. Native marsupials most feared the human 'super predator', fleeing humans 2.4 times more often than the next most frightening predator (dogs), and being most, and significantly, vigilant to humans. These results demonstrate that native marsupials are not na & iuml;ve to the peril humans pose, substantially expanding the taxonomic and geographic scope of the growing experimental evidence that wildlife worldwide generally perceive humans as the planet's most frightening predator. Introduced fallow deer fled humans, but not more than other predators, which we suggest may result from their being introduced. Our results point to both challenges concerning marsupial conservation and opportunities for exploiting fear of humans as a wildlife management tool.

AB  - <ol><li>Infectious disease can shape community structure, particularly when pathogens affect foundation species. Seagrasses are foundation species that form meadows along coasts worldwide, controlling sediment deposition and biogeochemical cycling while supporting a diverse community of fish and invertebrates. These plants are hosts to wasting diseases that cause necrotic tissue lesions, which could alter seagrass value as food, habitat and mediators of ecosystem processes. However, such biotic interactions and influences on disease dynamics are still not well understood.</li><li>We investigated whether a common herbivore affected the development of wasting disease on eelgrass. We measured the severity and prevalence of eelgrass wasting disease in a meadow across two summers through repeated field surveys. We assessed the role of the eelgrass herbivore on disease spread and growth using microcosm and mesocosm experiments. We further explored herbivore feeding preferences in a choice trial, which was paired with chemical analysis of plant tissue and analysed using a structural equation model.</li><li>While the herbivore facilitates the growth of new disease lesions among isolated leaves, on balance they reduce lesion severity by more than 50% in comparison with no-herbivore controls in field-realistic settings. This was likely because the herbivore strongly prefers to eat diseased rather than healthy tissue, consuming nearly twice as much lesion area in choice trials. This preference arises from pathogen-driven changes in the host plant; lesioned tissue requires less force to penetrate than non-lesioned tissue. Additionally, as lesions increase in size, their polyphenolic concentrations drop, which further increases the magnitude of preference for lesioned tissue.</li><li>Synthesis: These results suggest that these herbivores could help maintain disease in this system at a high prevalence (by facilitating disease development) but low severity (through preferential consumption), which is consistent with our field observations of nearly 100% prevalence and low severity in a natural bed where herbivore density is high. Describing such multi-species interactions in marine systems will advance our predictions of future disease states, as current understandings focus primarily on how environmental change contributes to pathogen outbreaks.</li> </ol>

AB  - The introduction of numerous exotic dung beetles across southern Australia in regions where native dung beetles are not generally efficient in processing livestock dung has resulted in significant reductions in the quantity of such dung on the soil surface in recent years. However, the direct impacts of such ecosystem services on pasture quality and soil nutrient mobility have not yet been investigated in the Riverina region of New South Wales (NSW), an area recognised for prime cattle and sheep production in Australia. Utilising 48 soil columns for lysimetry, we quantified the impact of a common introduced dung beetle (Bubas bison) in this region on water quality after permeation through four different soil types sown to winter annual pastures. Dung beetle treatments included dung plus dung beetles, dung alone and no dung beetles, and no dung and no beetles as a control. Dung beetles and soil type impacted on the performance of improved overseeded annual pastures as measured by biomass accumulation over a four-month growing season. The four soil types, namely, Chromosol, Kandosol, Rudosol, and Vertosol, differed considerably with respect to their water-holding capacity and nutrient profiles, as assessed by initial soil testing and soil leachate evaluation following rainfall plus simulated rainfall events. The concentration of Escherichia coli resulting from cattle dung, cattle dung plus beetles, and the control soils without dung or beetles was assessed in collected leachates over a three-month period. E. coli numbers were significantly increased following B. bison activity, when compared to the dung-only and control treatments. Evaluation of the soil microbiome, by assessing genomic DNA in soils sampled 10 cm below the soil surface where dung beetles remained active following tunnelling, revealed significant differences among soil types with respect to bacterial and fungal communities. Within each soil type, dung beetle activity impacted the fungal community structure, but not the bacterial community. Pasture performance as assessed by biomass accumulation was significantly improved following dung beetle activity in later stages of pasture growth, while E. coli numbers and total coliforms appeared unaffected by beetle presence.

AB  - In this paper, measurements of 2.012 bone remains from four different domestic species (sheep, goats, cattle and pigs) originating from 33 Bronze Age archaeological sites from the Balearic Islands, mainland Iberia, southern France and Sardinia, and spanning about 2500 years (3700-700 cal. BCE) have been compared. The results show that a decrease in animal size occurred in the Balearic Islands during the Bronze Age. It was not a local phenomenon but rather was a general pattern that happened in different territories. Yet it was more marked on the islands. The evidence shows that the four analyzed species were not affected in the same way and it was a nonlinear phenomenon. Indeed, during the Late Bronze Age some archaeological sites from the Balearics had taller caprines compared with the other contemporaneous places, also on the continent. A multi-factor explanation for these fluctuations is proposed in this paper, showing that animal sizes generally decreased during late prehistory -especially cattle- and this process could reflect different factors such as a combination of limited feeding, increased human pressure and endogamy.

AB  - Simple Summary In Australia, feral cats (Felis catus) have been a ubiquitous threatening process to Australian fauna since European colonisation. There is a concern that irrigating land on pastoral leases and storing agricultural produce may indirectly increase the abundance of feral cats and European red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), which in turn may negatively impact native species such as the threatened bilbies (Macrotis lagotis). Our baseline study on a pastoral lease in the arid subtropics of Western Australia revealed a high density of feral cats with dietary data that suggests the current native mammal assemblage on the lease is depauperate. Environmental damage caused by the intensification of agriculture may be compensated by implementing conservation projects directed towards reducing threatening processes and conserving threatened native species. In Australia, feral cats (Felis catus) have been a ubiquitous threatening process to Australian fauna since European colonisation. On Shamrock Station, in the north-west of Western Australia, the Argyle Cattle Company has proposed intensifying agriculture through the installation of irrigation pivots. There is concern that irrigating land and storing agricultural produce may indirectly increase the abundance of feral cats and European red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) on the property, which in turn may negatively impact threatened bilbies (Macrotis lagotis) that also inhabit the property. Feral cat control is required under the approved management plan for this project to mitigate this potential impact. Our baseline study revealed a high density of feral cats on Shamrock Station (0.87 cats km(-2)) and dietary data that suggest the current native mammal assemblage on Shamrock Station is depauperate. Given the high density of feral cats in this area, the effective control of this introduced predator is likely to confer benefits to the bilby and other native species susceptible to cat predation. We recommend ongoing monitoring of both native species and feral cats to determine if there is a benefit in implementing feral cat control around areas of intensive agriculture and associated cattle production.

AB  - Intraspecific variation in growth and defence among plant populations can be driven by differences in (a)biotic conditions, such as herbivory and resources. Introduction of species to novel environments affects simultaneously herbivory encountered by a plant and resource availability both directly and via altered competitive environment. Here, we address the question of how growth (leaf mass per area (LMA), plant size) and resistance traits (leaf alkaloids, leaf trichomes, resistance to a generalist snail) vary and covary between native and introduced populations of the garden lupine, Lupinus polyphyllus. We focused specifically on evolved differences among populations by measuring traits from plants grown from seed in a common environment. Plants from the introduced populations were more resistant against the generalist snail, Arianta arbustorum, and they had more leaf trichomes and higher LMA than plants from the native populations. The composition of alkaloids differed between native and introduced populations, with the native populations having more diversity in alkaloids among them. Resistance was positively associated with plant size and LMA across all populations. Other trait associations differed between native and introduced areas, implying that certain trade-offs may be fundamentally different between native and introduced populations. Our results suggest that, for the introduced populations, the loss of native herbivores and the alterations in resource availability have led to a lower diversity in leaf alkaloids among populations and may facilitate the evolution of novel trait optima without compensatory trade-offs. Such phytochemical similarity among introduced populations provides novel insights into mechanisms promoting successful plant invasions.

AB  - The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is experiencing rapid climate warming, resulting in affecting the marine food web. To investigate the microzooplankton spatial distribution and to assess how climate change could affect the tintinnids community, sea water samples were collected during late summer 2018 at 19 stations in three different areas: Deception Island, Elephant Island and Antarctic Sound. The microzooplankton community comprised mainly tintinnids, aloricate ciliates, heterotrophic dinoflagellates and micrometazoans. Microzooplankton abundance varied between 3 and 109 ind. L-1 and biomass ranged from 0.009 to 2.55 mu g C L-1. Significant differences in terms of abundance and taxonomic composition of microzooplankton were found among the three sampling areas. Deception Island area showed 44% of tintinnids and the rest were heterotrophic dinoflagellate, aloricate ciliates and micrometazoans. In Elephant Island and Antarctic Sound areas, tintinnids reached, respectively, 73% and 83% of the microzooplankton composition, with all the other groups varying between 20 and 30%. Tintinnids were the most representative group in the area, with the species Codonellopsis balechi, Codonellopsis glacialis, Cymatocylis convallaria and Cymatocylis drygalskii. The highest amounts of tintinnids were found at the surface and 100 m depth. The above mentioned species may be considered key species for the WAP and therefore they can be used to track environmental and hydrographical changes in the area. In late summer, microzooplankton presented low abundances and biomass, nevertheless they represented an important fraction of the planktonic community in the area.

AB  - Ecological phenomena operate at different spatial scales and are not uniform across landscapes or through time. One ecological theory that attempts to account for scaling and spatiotemporal variances is hierarchical patch dynamics. It introduces a hierarchical patch network with smaller spatiotemporal scales being nested within larger scales. However, few studies have modeled its presence within animal population dynamics. Locusts are an excellent model for investigating the spatiotemporal hierarchy of animal population dynamics, due to their high migratory capacity, large geographic ranges that extend across widely differing environments, and available long-term data on distributions. Here, we investigated the influence of preceding vegetation growth on desert locust Schistocerca gregaria and Australian plague locust Chortoicetes terminifera outbreaks on three spatial levels (species range > geographic region > land unit) and between seasons. Both species are dryland herbivores with population dynamics linked to habitat productivity pulses after rain. We used NDVI data (MODIS imagery) as a measure of vegetation growth in hierarchical generalized additive models at different scales. Locust outbreaks were either preceded by vegetation growth between 78 and 32 days (Australian plague locusts) or 32 and 20 days before (desert locust) the observation. Although prior vegetation growth characterized outbreaks of both species, the temporal pattern of NDVI differed between spatiotemporal levels. All model selection criteria selected for a similar spatial hierarchy for both species: geographic region > land unit which supports the hierarchical patch dynamics paradigm. Further, it illuminates important timing differences between geographic regions and land units for preceding vegetation growth and locust outbreaks which can help locust managers identify when and where outbreaks occur. By acknowledging the spatiotemporal patterning of locust abundance, we account for heterogeneity of population dynamics throughout species ranges. Our findings demonstrate the importance of incorporating spatiotemporal variation in population models of insects and other animals.

AB  - Fire has been suggested to be an initiation mechanism of landscape instability and coastal dune transgression, but modern evidence showing a shift to a transgressive dune phase is lacking. Following the largest wildfire in historical records on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, bimonthly uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys were conducted on three coastal dune sites to study their post-fire responses. The three sites studied here represent the landscape diversity of the temperate dunes of Kangaroo Island with both active coastal and inland relict stabilised dune fields studied. UAV surveys were used to reconstruct landscapes with structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry and compared over time to illustrate significant changes in the landscape. The geomorphic and vegetation changes are compared in net and intra-survey comparisons to illustrate the post-fire dunefield response and trends towards stabilisation. Because of a lack of reliable baseline pre-fire data, satellite geomedians are used to compute spectral indices to show the trajectory of ground cover in the study sites in the years preceding and following the fire. Satellite indices are used to separate 3D changes according to ground cover types and show their differing post-fire responses. Local and regional wind, temperature and rainfall records are presented to provide weather patterns of the years preceding and following the fire, illustrating the wet and mild post-fire weather. The overall results indicate no significant landscape instability across the studied sites and that the ground cover of vegetation is nearing pre-fire baselines, showing that a severe fire has not caused a transgressive dunefield to develop.

AB  - Aim The Island Rule-that is, the tendency for body size to decrease in large mammals and increase in small mammals on islands has been commonly evaluated through macroecological or macroevolutionary, pattern-orientated approaches, which generally fail to model the microevolutionary processes driving either dwarfing or gigantism. Here, we seek to identify which microevolutionary process could have driven extreme insular dwarfism in the extinct dwarf red deer population on the island of Jersey.
   Location Jersey, UK (Channel Islands).
   Taxon Red deer (Cervus elaphus).
   Methods We applied an individual-based quantitative genetics model parameterized with red deer life-history data to study the evolution of dwarfism in Jersey's deer, considering variations in island area and isolation through time due to sea level changes.
   Results The body size of red deer on Jersey decreased fast early on, due to phenotypic plasticity, then kept decreasing almost linearly over time down to the actual body size of the Jersey deer (36 kg on average). Only 1% of 10,000 replicates failed to reach that size in our simulations. The distribution of time to adaptation in these simulations was right skewed, with a median of 395 generations (equivalent to roughly 4 kyr), with complete dwarfism effectively occurring in less than 6 kyr 84.6% of times. About 72% of the variation in the time to adaptation between simulations was collectively explained by higher mutational variance, the number of immigrants from the continent after isolation, available genetic variance, heritability, and phenotypic plasticity.
   Main Conclusions The extreme dwarfing of red deer on Jersey is an expected outcome of high mutational variance, high immigration rate, a wide adaptive landscape, low levels of inbreeding, and high phenotypic plasticity (in the early phase of dwarfing), all occurring within a time window of around 6 kyr. Our model reveals how extreme dwarfism is a plausible outcome of common, well-known evolutionary processes.

AB  - While it is well documented that wolves (Canis lupus) hunt and scavenge bison (Bison bison) from some long-established populations, such ecological interactions are not well known for most small, reintroduced populations in the boreal forest. Indeed, predation or scavenging of reintroduced bison in the boreal forest is rarely reported. Yet, documenting instances of bison killed or consumed is imperative to understanding the integration of reintroduced populations into local food webs and ecosystems. Such observations also indicate that reintroduced bison may be under selective pressure from their key predator. We compiled 20 verifiable observations of wolves hunting or scavenging bison from three reintroduced populations in northwestern Canada. We report the first confirmed observations of wolves feeding on bison from the 'Nahanni' and 'Pink Mountain' populations. We also report new records of wolves hunting or scavenging bison from the 'Aishihik' population. Where sex was known, most (14 of 17) bison consumed were females and 17 of 20 were adults (either sex). Contrary to other studies, we found that 7 of 20 bison consumed by wolves were aged individuals. It took 19-50 years since bison were reintroduction before verifiable observations of wolf-bison interactions emerged for these populations, indicating that wolves were likely slow to view reintroduced bison as prey and incorporate them into their diets. These observations are of value mainly because they provide unequivocal evidence that these reintroduced bison populations are becoming integrated into local food webs and beginning to be under selective pressure by their main predator, both of which are hallmarks of ecological restoration.

AB  - Simple Summary Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy affecting sheep and goats. Due to similarities with mad cow disease (BSE) which is transmissible to humans, scrapie is considered of significance for its theoretical zoonotic potential. A variety of control strategies have been proposed and applied over the years. While herd depopulation, culling of affected susceptible animals, and disinfection measures are poorly successful, selective breeding schemes focused on amino acid substitutions (polymorphisms) in prion protein (PrP) would be the best way for eradication. In sheep, the association between PrP gene polymorphism argininine on codon 171 is highly effective for scrapie resistance breeding. Although in goats this polymorphism is absent, three other candidate PrP amino acid polymorphisms have been recognized for resistance breeding. For Greece with the largest goat population in Europe, the frequencies of these polymorphisms has yet to be sufficiently documented. This study performed a large-scale, cross-sectional survey for a large part of the country, regarding PrP polymorphic codons 110, 146, 211, and 222, and estimated effects of these polymorphisms on (i) the likelihood to be infected by scrapie, and (ii) scrapie status at the herd level, revealing possible candidate PrP amino acid polymorphisms to be used in breeding for scrapie-resistance programs. Scrapie is considered an endemic disease in both sheep and goats in Greece. However, contrary to sheep, in goats more than one prion protein (PrP) polymorphism has been recognized as a candidate for resistance breeding against the disease. For an impression, candidates which are circulating, (i) brain samples (n = 525) from scrapie-affected (n = 282) and non-affected (n = 243) animals within the national surveillance program, and (ii) individual blood samples (n = 1708) from affected (n = 241) and non-affected (n = 1467) herds, in a large part of mainland Greece and its islands, were collected and assayed. A dedicated Taqman method was used to test for amino acid polymorphisms 110T/P, 146N/S/D, 211R/Q, and 222Q/K. Highly prevalent genotypes were 110TT, 146NN, 211RR, and 222QQ. The frequencies of polymorphisms in blood and negative brain samples for codons 110P, 211Q, and 222K were 4.0%, 3.0%, and 1.9%, respectively, while 146D (0.7%) was present only on Karpathos island. Codon 110P was exclusively found in scrapie-negative brains, and homozygous 110P/P in two scrapie-negative goats. It is concluded that breeding programs in Karpathos could focus on codon 146D, while in other regions carriers of the 110P and 222K allele should be sought. Case-control and challenge studies are now necessary to elucidate the most efficient breeding strategies.

AB  - Sun exposure is a major threat to the survival of cacti seeds in desertic environments. During summer, fruits of the columnar cactus Pachycereus pringlei from San Esteban Island, northwestern Mexico, are eaten by herbivorous iguanas, and after digestion, seeds are deposited within their scats. We compared the germination percentage of wild seeds exposed to the sun while lying on the ground of the island, with that of seeds collected directly from the fruit, and seeds obtained from old and recently deposited iguana scats. Our results indicate that direct sun exposure causes drastic reduction in seed germination, and this negative effect is reduced in seeds shielded inside feces, although with a cost on germination. We discuss some of the possible implications of seed shielding in the population of P. pringlei.

AB  - Alpine pastures of Kaghan valley are one of the most productive grazing lands in Pakistan. These pastures provide many ecosystem services which are important for livelihood of the local people, nomadic graziers and economy of the country. Alpine pastures of Kaghan spread over an area of 71,939 ha constituting 28% of the total area of the valley. Present study was conducted to quantify the economic value of provisioning ecosystem services i.e. forage production in the study area. The data was collected from 40 fenced experimental plots laid out at eight sites during June-September 2019. Livestock population was estimated through a field survey by interviewing 485 graziers. Results indicated that 65% of the vegetation was comprised of forbs, 24% grasses and 11% was shrubs. Average dry weight of forage was calculated as 2,900 kg ha-1. Total forage production in the grazeable areas of alpine pastures of Kaghan Valley was estimated as 146,035 tonnes per year. The average price of air-dried forage in the area was Rs. 12,000 per tonne or US$ 74.48 per tonne. Therefore, total economic value of forage production in the grazeable areas of Kaghan valley was Rs. 1,752 million or US$ 10.87 million per year. Total livestock population of the Alpine pastures of Kaghan valley was estimated as 163,550 animals. About 56% of the livestock grazing in the pastures comprised of goats, 39% sheep, 2% cows, 2% horses, 1% donkeys, 0.4% mules and 0.3% buffaloes. It was concluded that the alpine pastures of Kaghan valley are very productive and have a key role in the local economy. Sustainable management of alpine pastures will ensure the continuity of valuable ecosystem services.

AB  - Exotic herbivores can exert profound impacts on terrestrial communities, but their ecological effects on marine habitats are not sufficiently quantified. The exotic crab Percnon gibbesi, which is rapidly spreading throughout the Mediterranean Sea, grazes almost exclusively on benthic macrophytes, providing an opportunity to study the potential impacts of herbivores in the marine realm. Here, we first quantified the abundance of P. gibbesi in Mallorca (Balearic Islands; Spain) in 2023/2024 and reported average densities of 61 individuals 100 m-2, approximately 30 times greater than those recorded in 2003 on the islands. We then performed a feeding preference experiment using common native and invasive species of macroalgae (Caulerpa cylindracea, Halimeda incrassata, Haliptilon virgatum, Halopteris scoparia, Padina pavonica, and Ulva compressa) from the Mediterranean Sea. The per capita grazing rates of P. gibbesi (3.83 +/- 1.71 WW g crab-1 day-1), which can ingest almost 75% of their body weight daily, were higher than those recorded for most native herbivorous species in the Mediterranean. The estimated daily grazing rates for P. gibbesi average 23.59 +/- 15.17 kg WW macroalgae ha-1 day-1, value that corresponds with 0.1% to 10.9% (average 5.5%) of the total macroalgae production in this area. Our experiment revealed clear preferences of P. gibbesi for three species of macroalgae, which were not explained by the nutritional content. Overall, our results generate great concern and, coupled with the large extent of the invasion, indicate that the ecological impacts of this exotic herbivore on Mediterranean marine communities could be substantial, and have, until now, gone largely unreported.

AB  - Large herbivorous fishes, such as parrotfishes, play a critical role in coral reef ecosystems by limiting the coverage of macroalgae. Yet, in the Colombian Caribbean, parrotfishes are being increasingly targeted for human consumption as the demand for fish increases with tourist numbers. The Colombian Caribbean is dominated by Afro-descendant communities, and music is a deeply rooted form of expression and communication. 'Champeta', the local music folklore, is heard at all times of day and danced continuously in the islands off the coast of Cartagena. We conducted a survey of local tourist and fisheries stakeholders to characterise the parrotfish fishery, and designed a contextualised awareness-raising campaign of the ecological role of parrotfish and the need for management in the Islands of the Corales del Rosario and San Bernardo National Park. In doing so, we test if Champeta could be used as a mechanism for social-ecological change in Caribbean coastal communities in the context of coral reef conservation. Locals were engaged in every aspect of the campaign, especially with the song, as the campaign was a process rooted in their culture, interests and idiosyncrasies. Surveys of restaurants illustrated the size of the fishery and the extent of misinformation surrounding the consumption of parrotfish by tourists. We found that both locals and tourists held misconceptions about the ecological role of parrotfish and were supportive of efforts to protect them.

AB  - Simple Summary Zoos help to rescue, rehabilitate, and care for wildlife. Approximately fifteen years ago, the Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) was successfully reintroduced into the Alps. There are at least 17 zoos throughout Europe that keep Alpine ibexes in captivity. To ensure success, the staff must understand the animal's specific requirements and provide leading managers and researchers to investigate strategies such as feed quality control, successful reproduction, and appropriate social group structure. The animal welfare strategy is an important factor for success. Appropriate and stress-free animal capture and sampling methods are especially important. Non-invasive sampling methods are increasingly being used in veterinary practice. Cortisol (C) concentrations can be measured in various matrices, such as saliva, hair, and faeces. Blood collection using venipuncture, which is stressful, can be replaced by collection with kissing bugs (Triatomines) or medicinal leeches (Hirudo medicinalis). In this article, C concentrations in different matrices were compared in Alpine ibexes at the zoo. Differences according to the sex, age, and season of sampling were also compared. The usefulness of blood collection using venipuncture versus kissing bugs or medicinal leeches and the collection of saliva, faeces, hair, urine, and tears for measuring "immunoreactive" C (iC) concentration in Alpine ibexes was verified using commercial enzyme immunoassays. The mean value of serum C was highest in serum collected using venipuncture and lowest in serums collected using kissing bugs. Statistically significant differences were observed between venipuncture and kissing bugs and between leeches and kissing bugs. However, no statistically significant difference was found in C concentrations between samples collected with venipuncture and those collected with leeches. The highest mean value of C concentration was measured in serum (all three methods), followed by that in hair and faeces, and the lowest mean value was found in saliva. Statistically significant differences were found between saliva and faeces samples and between saliva and hair samples. The difference between the concentrations for faeces and hair was not statistically significant. A significant difference in C concentration between males and females was found in saliva. A significant difference in C concentration among different ages was measured in serum obtained using venipuncture in all three groups and in faeces between the groups older than ten years and younger than 10 months. Highly significant differences in C concentrations were also found between hair sampled in summer and hair sampled in autumn. Collecting tear and urine samples is a laborious procedure and is therefore less acceptable for C determination. Due to the small number of samples, statistical values are not given for these two matrices.

AB  - The endangered Amami rabbit (Pentalagus furnessi), endemic to two Japanese subtropical islands, has a habit of egesting faeces on streambanks in their habitats. We hypothesized that rabbit faeces transported into streams are consumed by aquatic animals. Underwater behavioural observations using time-lapse photography showed that decapod crustaceans foraged on rabbit faeces introduced experimentally into a forest stream on Amami-Oshima Island. From in situ samples, stable isotopic analysis showed mean contributions of rabbit faeces to diets of benthic macroinvertebrates ranged from 12% to 66%. This study suggests that rabbit faeces form an allochthonous resource unique to this insular stream ecosystem.

AB  - Shifts between the alternate stable states of sea urchin barren grounds and kelp forests correspond to sea urchin density. In the Aleutian Archipelago, green sea urchins Strongylocentrotus polyacanthus are the dominant herbivores that graze kelp forests. Sea urchin recruitment is an important driver that influences sea urchin density, particularly in the absence of top-down control from a keystone predator such as the sea otter Enhydra lutris. To understand how the biological community may influence patterns of sea urchin recruitment, we compared sea urchin recruit (size <= 20 mm) densities with biomass of other benthic organisms in both barren ground and kelp forest habitats at 9 islands across the Aleutian Archipelago. Patterns of biological community structure between the 2 habitats did not explain patterns of sea urchin recruits; however, the same 10 specific taxa were found to correlate with sea urchin recruits in each habitat. Taxa that showed strong positive correlations included Codium, Constantinea, Schizymenia, and hydrozoans, while strong negative correlations were observed with Pachyarthron and Pugettia. Weak positive correlations were observed with Alcyonidium and ascidiaceans in both habitats, while weak variable relationships were detected with Polysiphonia and Corallina between habitats. The observed species-specific relationships may be due to small sea urchin displacement by larger conspecifics, larval responses to settlement cues, post-settlement survival via biogenic refugia, or potentially predation. These potential species-specific interactions were apparent, regardless of habitat, and it can be inferred that they would be preserved in the presence or absence of keystone predation.

   center dot There is little information on the fate of individual birds in and following fire, but those of more mobile species may have fled, with reports of forest species in suburbs and other unusual habitats in the days and months after the fire.
   center dot Many also died, with burnt birds as large as eagles washed up on beaches. Those that survived lost food and shelter. There is also likely to have been a net loss of tree hollows used for nesting by many species; replacement will take a long time.
   center dot Studies to date suggest that recolonisation is rapid as habitat recovers its structure, but recovery may take years and possibly decades for species associated with rainforest and other wetter habitats.
   center dot Active management is expected to help a few species to recover, particularly through nest box erection.
   Main findings
   center dot The ranges of 180 million individual birds from more than 350 terrestrial bird taxa intersected with the 2019-20 megafires.
   center dot The 2019-20 wildfires burnt > 25% of the range of 51 bird taxa, much of it severely; the most extreme overlap (68% of range burnt) was for the Kangaroo Island southern emu-wren (Stipiturus malachurus halmaturinus).
   center dot Of the most fire-affected birds, eight were meeting the IUCN Red List criteria as threatened or Near Threatened before the fire. Another 19 were assessed as meeting the criteria directly because of the fires.
   center dot The IUCN Red Index for all Australian birds declined by over 9% as a direct result of the fires.
   center dot Bird communities in burnt rainforests were at lower densities after the fires and were recovering more slowly than those in adjacent burnt dry sclerophyll communities.
   center dot Populations of the glossy black-cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus lathami) did better than expected in the year after fire, though may face future food shortages.

AB  - Introduction: Epizoochorous dispersal of grassland plants by large herbivores is an important way by which grassland plants achieve population expansion over long distances. However, little is known about the maximum distance that seeds can be dispersed by domestic animals under seasonal grazing, which is the most common type of grassland management worldwide, especially in alpine regions.
   Methods: To this end, we estimated the distance over which epizoochory dispersal occurs via yaks (Poephagus grunniens) for seven common plant species seeds in an alpine meadow under seasonal grazing using a simulated yak-fur seed adhesion test combined with observations of grazing behavior.
   Results: The results showed that, as yak primary (e.g., walking time) and secondary (e.g., foraging rate) behavioral patterns differed significantly across seasons (P< 0.05), the epizoochory dispersal distances of plant seeds also had clear seasonal dynamics, manifesting as spring > summer > autumn > winter, and that the length of seed adhesive structures correlated positively with the retention rate as well as retention time on yak fur. The relatively slow loss of diaspores observed in this study mainly shows that moving yak from one seasonal pasture to the following allows the dispersal of diaspores between two successive pastures. The dispersal scale was even wider (maximum dispersal distance of similar to 35 km) for seeds with special appendages (i.e., mucilage, sticking to the fur due to mucilage presence).
   Discussion: Our results highlight that yaks are substantial seed dispersal vectors for alpine meadow plants and that seasonal grazing is a suitable management method for coping with habitat fragmentation as well as plant diversity conservation in alpine areas from the perspective of seed dispersal.

AB  - Interspecific ecological interactions are inherently context-dependent. They may vary in both magnitude and sign depending on the biotic and abiotic conditions, depicting a mutualism-antagonism continuum. However, how population abundances and the activity of interacting species modulate these interactions remains underexplored. Here, we chose the interaction between the Mediterranean palm Chamaerops humilis and the feral goat Capra hircus in Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Spain). We selected three study plots with low, intermediate and high intensities of goat activity where we characterized palm distribution, seed rain, seed predation and early palm recruitment during two consecutive years. Since goats can cause both costs (e.g. florivory) and benefits (e.g. seed dispersal) to C. humilis performance, we investigated the following three questions: 1) does the spatial distribution of adult palms vary depending on the intensity of goat activity? 2) Does the intensity of goat activity influence seed rain and its potential spatial association with adult palms? 3) To what extent does the intensity of goat activity determine post-dispersal events such as seed predation and seedling emergence? We found that adult palms showed a more clumped and complex distribution (double-cluster process) in plots with low and intermediate goat activity compared to that with high goat activity (simple-cluster process). In the low goat activity plot, dispersed seeds were spatially aggregated around adult palms, showing twice as much insect-seed predation and nearly three times lower seed germination success than those in the intermediate goat activity plot. Palm seed dispersal and recruitment were almost nil in the high goat activity plot due to heavy consumption of palm inflorescences and developing fruits by goats. Our findings demonstrate how the net outcome of plant-animal interactions can change from mutualism to antagonism, from reproductive service to reproductive collapse, depending on the abundance and the activity of the interacting species.

AB  - Translocations are essential for re-establishing wildlife populations. As they sometimes fail, it is critical to assess factors that influence their success pre-translocation. Socioecological suitability models (SESMs) integrate social acceptance and ecological suitability to enable identification of areas where wildlife populations will expand, which makes it likely that SESMs will also be useful for predicting translocation success. To inform site selection for potential elk Cervus canadensis reintroduction to north-eastern Minnesota, United States, we developed broadscale maps of social acceptance from surveys of local residents and landowners, animal use equivalence (AUE) from forage measured in the field and empirical conflict risk from geospatial data. Resulting SESMs integrated social acceptance favourability scores, AUE and conflict risk, and weighted SESMs showed the relative influences of acceptance and conflict. Social acceptance was positive for local residents and landowners (mean >= 5.4; scale of 1-7). AUE (scaled to an elk home range) ranged between 1 and 9 elk/16 km(2) during winter, and from 14 to 83 elk/16 km(2) during summer. Human-elk conflict risk was low (mean <= 0.10; scaled 0-1), increasing from north to south. Geographical distributions differed for social acceptance, AUE and conflict risk, and weighted SESMs revealed unsuitable areas that were otherwise obscured. Synthesis and applications. Integrating human-wildlife conflict risk into SESMs shows where social acceptance of translocated species is likely to erode, even where viewed favourably pre-translocation, to inform translocation planning by highlighting interactions between key factors. Such integrated models supplement existing reintroduction biology frameworks by supporting decision-making and knowledge development. In north-eastern Minnesota, natural resource managers who are considering elk reintroductions are using SESMs reported here to identify where human-elk conflict is unlikely to result in an isolated elk population and where addressing concerns for area residents about conflict risk is essential.

AB  - IntroductionSpace use patterns in fish result from the interactions between individual movement behaviour and characteristics of the environment. Herbivorous parrotfishes, for instance, are constrained by the availability of resources and different predation risks. The resulting spatial distribution of the fish population can strongly influence community composition and ecosystem resilience. MethodsIn a novel approach, we combine individual-based modelling (IBM) with an artificial potential field algorithm to realistically represent fish movements and the decision-making process. Potential field algorithms, which are popular methods in mobile robot path planning, efficiently generate the best paths for an entity to navigate through vector fields of repellent and attracting forces. In our model the repellent and attracting forces are predation risk and food availability, both implemented as separate grid-based vector fields. The coupling of individual fish bioenergetics with a navigation capacity provides a mechanistic basis to analyse how the habitat structure influences population dynamics and space utilization. ResultsModel results indicate that movement patterns and the resulting spatial distributions strongly depend on habitat fragmentation with the bioenergetic capacity to spawn and reproduce being particularly susceptible processes at the individual level. The resulting spatial distributions of the population are more irregularly distributed among coral reef patches the more the coral reef habitat becomes fragmented and reduced. DiscussionThis heterogeneity can have strong implications for the delivered ecosystem functioning, e.g., by concentrating or diluting the grazing effort. Our results also highlight the importance of incorporating individual foraging-path patterns and the spatial exploitation of microhabitats into marine spatial planning by considering the effects of fragmentation. The integration of potential fields into IBMs represents a promising strategy to advance our understanding of complex decision-making in animals by implementing a more realistic and dynamic decision-making process, in which each fish weighs different rewards and risks of the environment. This information may help to identify core areas and essential habitat patches and assist in effective marine spatial management.

AB  - The overabundance of sika deer has become a significant threat to plant communities across Japan. As a result of the deer overgrazing, rare plants are undergoing a demographic bottleneck, leading to a loss of genetic diversity. Genetic diversity is crucial for the reproductive success of self-incompatible plants, and it also provides evolutionary potential, which increases their long-term population viability. Therefore, it is essential to appropriately manage the remaining genotypes to conserve local genetic resources. In this study, we exemplify this, via a conservation genetic analysis of Parasenecio peltifolius populations impacted by deer. Genetic data revealed that the small populations confined to isolated refugial sites consisted of effectively single genets. Recent reproductive failures in these populations may be attributed to the loss of genotypic diversity. Despite the bottlenecks, the remaining genets exhibited high individual heterozygosity, which is a good indicator that they have not been affected by severe inbreeding. Hybrid simulations suggested that interpopulation outbreeding between the unique genotypes can be a viable option to promote sexual reproduction and re-establish genetic diversity within the local populations. Establishing artificial progenies in botanical gardens can serve as a vital genetic resource for the long-term viability of threatened P. peltifolius populations.
   This study genetically investigated the endangered Parasenecio peltifolius populations threatened by deer overgrazing to reveal that the remaining populations consisted of single genetic clones. Hybrid simulations suggested that artificial crosses between the unique genotypes can be a viable option to re-establish genetic diversity within the local populations and promote sexual reproduction. The artificial progenies in ex situ botanical gardens can serve as a vital genetic resource for the long-term survival of threatened populations. image

AB  - Sea urchins have important effects on marine ecosystems such as rocky shores and coral reefs across the world. However, species diversity and molecular phylogeny of most echinoid taxa are poorly known in Iran. In this study, the phylogenetic relationships of one of the most abundant species of the genus Echinometra in the Persian Gulf were examined. Echinoids were collected from the intertidal zone of Qeshm Island and Lengeh Port on March and December 2017. Morphological criteria based on valid identification keys combined with molecular analysis of a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) protein-coding gene were used to delineate Echinometra species. Our analyses showed that all specimens (N = 15) belong to Echinometra sp. EZ. Tree topologies indicated that our individuals from two sampling sites formed a distinct monophyletic clade with E. sp. EZ, demonstrating high support values. This is the first phylogenetic analysis of E. sp. EZ from Iran.

AB  - Species at their warm range margin are potentially threatened by higher temperatures, but may persist in microrefugia. Whether such microsites occur due to more suitable microclimate or due to lower biotic pressure from, for example competitive species, is still not fully resolved. We examined whether boreal bryophytes and lichens show signs of direct climate limitation, that is whether they perform better in cold and/or humid microclimates at their warm range margin. We transplanted a moss, a liverwort and a lichen to 58 boreal forest sites with different microclimates at the species' southern range margin in central Sweden. Species were grown in garden soil patches to control the effects of competitive exclusion and soil quality. We followed the transplanted species over three growing seasons (2016-2018) and modelled growth and vitality for each species as a function of subcanopy temperature, soil moisture, air humidity and forest type. In 2018, we also recorded the cover of other plants having recolonized the garden soil patches and modelled this potential future competition with the same environmental variables plus litter. Species performance increased with warmer temperatures, which was often conditional on high soil moisture, and at sites with more conifers. Soil moisture had a positive effect, especially on the moss in the last year 2018, when the growing season was exceptionally hot and dry. The lichen was mostly affected by gastropod grazing. Recolonization of other plants was also faster at warmer and moister sites. The results indicate that competition, herbivory, shading leaf litter and water scarcity might be more important than the direct effects of temperature for performance at the species' warm range margin. Synthesis. In a transplant experiment with three boreal understorey species, we did not find signs of direct temperature limitation towards the south. Forest microrefugia, that is habitats where these species could persist regional warming, may instead be sites with fewer competitors and enemies, and with sufficient moisture and more conifers in the overstorey.

AB  - Rewilding is habitat restoration that attempts to return ecosystems to their state before human alterations were imposed. Rewilding might involve actions that are not desired by society. As a result, a compromised form of rewilding has been proposed that is generally known as rewilding lite, which involves some human intervention to achieve the goals of a more natural state of ecosystems that were historically disturbed by anthropogenic influences. Rewilding lite is gaining traction in Europe where marginal agriculture areas are being abandoned. We addressed a variant that we called livestock rewilding (LR) based on the use of herbivorous livestock species to restore ecological functions and trophic complexity (functional integrity) in abandoned agricultural landscapes. Our objective was to assess societal attitudes and awareness of LR in Spain based on the answers of 1,036 respondents of a self-selecting questionnaire of 27 closed-ended questions addressed to the general public using snowball sampling, conducted between March and July 2021. Seventy-five percent of the respondents supported LR but only on the condition of imposing minimum hazards to people, crops, and property. Ranchers were the least likely societal group to support LR (58%). Women had the greatest enthusiasm for LR (79% women vs. 71% men). Horses, donkeys, and goats were the most preferred species to be included in LR programs, with pigs as the least popular after cattle and sheep. There was support for the removal of excess individuals of rewilded livestock and for the use of their meat for human consumption, especially among male respondents. Respondents were reticent to accept mortality in LR populations caused by natural stochastic events and discriminated between livestock species for population control methods. Respondents preferred non-lethal methods of population control; involving hunters was a second choice. Some hunters were reluctant to participate in population control of rewilded livestock, especially if they had to pay, and were reticent to shoot equids but keen to shoot goats. There was general support among Spanish respondents for LR, though there were significant differences between societal groups in attitudes towards the type, species, and intensity of management required to minimize hazards to people's health, crops, and the environment. Livestock rewilding is a plausible tool for the restoration of trophic complexity in abandoned agricultural land in Spain that could be used to circumvent the introduction of allochthonous wild species.

AB  - Predator loss can cause shifts in ecosystem state, especially when accompanied by changes in the behaviour of its prey. The recent decline of predatory sunflower sea stars Pycnopodia helianthoides and a coincident a decline of kelp forests across the northeastern Pacific raises questions about their role in kelp forest ecosystem maintenance and recovery. While P. helianthoides may support kelp forests by consuming herbivorous sea urchins, less is known about their non-consumptive effects, especially in degraded habitats. Here, we ask: How do the non-consumptive effects of this predator vary among prey species, and what are the emergent effects on community-level grazing pressure in a degraded habitat when kelp is reintroduced? We conducted a field experiment, where we deployed kelp blades in urchin barrens at discrete distances from caged P. helianthoides and control cages for 24 h. We demonstrate a reduction in the density of red sea urchins Mesocentrotus franciscanus nearest the sunflower star and no effect on green sea urchins Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis. Our results suggest the chemical cue of P. helianthoides elicits a localized landscape of fear of approximately 15 m2 that suppresses grazing, and that the non-consumptive effects of P. helianthoides on sea urchin behaviour may be important for kelp restoration.

AB  - Reliable population estimates are one of the most elementary needs for the management of wildlife, particularly for introduced ungulates on oceanic islands. We aimed to produce accurate and precise density estimates of Philippine deer (Rusa marianna) and wild pigs (Sus scrofa) on Guam using motion-triggered cameras combined with distance sampling to estimate densities from observations of unmarked animals while accounting for imperfect detection. We used an automated digital data processing pipeline for species recognition and to estimate the distance to detected species. Our density estimates were slightly lower than published estimates, consistent with management to reduce populations. We estimated the number of camera traps needed to obtain a 0.1 coefficient of variation was substantial, requiring > ten-fold increase in camera traps, while estimates with precision of 0.2 or 0.3 were more achievable, requiring doubling to quadrupling the number of camera traps. We provide best practices for establishing and conducting distance sampling with camera trap surveys for density estimation based on lessons learned during this study. Future studies should consider distance sampling with camera traps to efficiently survey and monitor unmarked animals, particularly medium-sized ungulates, in tropical, oceanic island ecosystems.

AB  - Succession patterns spanning three seasons for insect fauna on pig cadavers were studied in Changwon, South Korea in 2018 and 2019. A total of 107 species belonging to 41 families in six orders were collected and identified. Four decomposition stages were recognized: fresh, bloated, decay, and dry. The number of species increased significantly after the fresh stage and reached the maximum number by the decay stage. The sequence of insect succession followed a general pattern in which Diptera peaked initially and Coleoptera peaked later. Chrysomya pinguis was the most frequently present species, and the timing of its different developmental stages on cadavers could be the most important indicator for post-mortem interval estimations in Changwon. Spatial and seasonal differences in the richness of insects were not significant. However, Calliphora nigribarbis occurred exclusively in spring and autumn, and Pheropsophus javanus occurred exclusively in one locality. Therefore, these species may be important for characterizing the different seasons or locations during post-mortem interval estimations. A list of the insects associated with above-ground pig cadavers during the three seasons was compiled, and it may be useful for estimating the time since death in areas with a similar bioclimate.

AB  - Marginal hill farmland is a key target for the restoration of temperate indigenous forest, which can help mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss. Reliance on natural regeneration and minimum interference management (MIM) is a low-cost restoration strategy for farmers, with the transition from pasture to woody scrub vegetation (whether indigenous or exotic) an important early successional phase. However, few studies have determined the key factors that influence the regeneration of woody vegetation on pastoral farmland, nor the rate at which regeneration occurs. Using a geospatial analysis of a New Zealand pastoral hill farm subject to variable grazing and MIM, this study found that only 3.8% of grassland experienced detectable regeneration of woody vegetation over 16 years. The key factor influencing natural regeneration was proximity to existing woody vegetation, with the probability of regeneration decreasing as distance increased. Cattle grazing had a significant negative impact, with regeneration more likely to occur in areas free from cattle. Sheep grazing exhibited no significant positive or negative relationship with regeneration. To support natural regeneration of woody vegetation, landowners should prioritize areas with a higher presence of existing woody vegetation and exclude cattle. To increase the rate of regeneration, landowners should consider active management regimes and supplemental restoration strategies, such as applied nucleation and the introduction of nurse species. Given the increased cost and complexity of such approaches, effective government incentive programmes may be needed to provide landowners with financial support and expertise.

AB  - Captive breeding programmes represent the most intensive type of ex situ population management for threatened species. One example is the Cuvier's gazelle programme that started in 1975 with only four founding individuals, and after more than four decades of management in captivity, a reintroduction effort was undertaken in Tunisia in 2016, to establish a population in an area historically included within its range. Here, we aim to determine the genetic consequences of this reintroduction event by assessing the genetic diversity of the founder stock as well as of their descendants. We present the first whole-genome sequencing dataset of 30 Cuvier's gazelles including captive-bred animals, animals born in Tunisia after a reintroduction and individuals from a genetically unrelated Moroccan population. Our analyses revealed no difference between the founder and the offspring cohorts in genome-wide heterozygosity and inbreeding levels, and in the amount and length of runs of homozygosity. The captive but unmanaged Moroccan gazelles have the lowest genetic diversity of all genomes analysed. Our findings demonstrate that the Cuvier's gazelle captive breeding programme can serve as source populations for future reintroductions of this species. We believe that this study can serve as a starting point for global applications of genomics to the conservation plan of this species.

AB  - The recognition of a proboscidean subspecies, Mammuthus armeniacus taiwanicus, from the Pleistocene represents one of the milestones for paleontological research in Taiwan in the 1970s. However, the whereabouts of the holotype and referred specimens remain unknown due to curation issues. Here, we report the rediscovery of the holotype and five referred specimens in the Tainan City Zuojhen Fossil Park collection and National Taiwan University, out of 16 original specimens in the private and museum collections, after our intense search for historical fossil materials. Given the size difference between the holotype (smaller) from Taiwan and other Eurasian mammoths, this Taiwan mammoth may represent an island dwarf rather than only a subspecies of steppe mammoths as originally identified in 1975. Our rediscovery of original materials of mammoths from the Pleistocene of Taiwan promises to further test this taxonomic and evolutionary hypothesis in the eastern margin of Eurasia, and to elucidate the Pleistocene extinctions and faunal turnover leading to the modern biodiversity.

AB  - Systematic field surveys were conducted in 2010-13 for the threatened, globally rare plant species, Helonias bullata L. (swamp pink: Liliaceae) in New Jersey, which contains 60% of known populations. A total of 90 sites were visited, including 56% of extant populations, focusing on the highest quality, largest, and most geographically representative populations in the state in order to comprehensively assess the species' status. A complete census and threat assessment was conducted for each population, using standardized methods adopted during previous surveys in 1997-2001, and population trends were determined by comparing results between data sets. The results found declines in 83% of Helonias populations in the past 10 yr, including severe declines (> 67%) in 53% of populations, and another 26% experiencing declines of 20% or more. Analyses of past and present data sets found the primary cause of declines appeared to be herbivory by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), which had not been previously regarded as a significant threat to the species, followed by hydrological changes caused by human development and/or water consumption. Browse damage to Helonias was directly observed in 84% of populations, with an average of 40% of Helonias clusters exhibiting recent damage at each site. Concern for observer bias was also explicitly addressed in the methods and analyses providing further confidence in the results. Implications for the conservation and recovery of Helonias are discussed, as well as the benefits and limitations of the standardized methods used for long-term studies of this and other rare plant species in the future.

AB  - Simple Summary The Xuwen coral reef, as a potential refuge for corals to adapt to high-temperature migration, is an ideal "laboratory" to determine the impact of human activities on coral reef ecology in the northern South China Sea (NSCS). Global warming, coastal eutrophication and the decrease in herbivores has influenced coral reef degradation; compared with human activities, global climate change is the stronger influence on coral reef degradation on a large scale. For the Xuwen coral reef, which is in the coastal zone, anthropogenic stressors are more significant to the rapid degradation of its coral reef ecosystems. Under these circumstances, more evidence is required to understand the response of high-latitude reefs under natural and anthropogenic stresses. In this study, we investigated the ecological features of the scleractinian coral assemblage and their correlation with environmental factors on the Xuwen coral reef in 2020. Based on the data acquired by investigation and the implementation of statistical analysis methods, potential environmental conditions favoring coral communities in Xuwen were summarized. These results of the survey are expected to provide a basis for bridging the gap between economic development and sustainable management. Taking the coral communities of the Xuwen coral reef in 2020 as the research object, we analyzed the species composition, diversity, and interspecific Spearman correlation of the scleractinian coral communities, investigated the features and spatial distribution of the scleractinian coral community, and discussed the correlation between the community composition and environmental factors to identify the affecting factors and their sources. These results showed that (1) compared with the survey in 2004, the coverage of corals in 2020 had significantly decreased, while the dominant genera were still Goniopora and Porites. The coral morphology was massive, and the diversity of the coral community (Shannon-Wiener index, H') was 2.87. The distribution of coral was uneven. The competition among some dominant species of coral was intense. (2) The mass coral bleaching event in the NSCS in August 2020 did not cause severe coral death in the short term on the Xuwen coral reef. (3) The growth of the coral community in 2020 might be greatly affected by high suspended solids and nutrient levels, which were related to the current, mariculture, and coastal erosion. (4) Anthropogenic activities such as coastal aquaculture and fishing were the major factors leading to the reduction in coral coverage on Xuwen coral reef in the past 10 years.

AB  - Habitat selection is critical to informing wildlife management and conservation. However, different behaviors require the use of different habitat components. Not considering different behavioral states in habitat selection analyses can overlook factors influencing selection and misinterpretation of direction and strength of selection. We investigated how behavioral states influence habitat selection in female wood bison (Bison bison athabascae). Our objective was to expand the understanding of trade-offs animals make to meet their physiological requirements in a heterogeneous landscape. We visited bison and random locations, to quantify forest vegetation structure and nutritional components of bison's habitat. Bison locations were classified as foraging (23%), traveling (58%), or bedding (20%) based on signs of these behaviors. We then used resource selection functions to evaluate habitat preferences for each behavioral state and all bison locations. All behaviors indicated selection for open habitats consistent with what would be expected for this species. However, traveling and bedding activities were in areas with drier soils, while foraging activities selected for wetter soils. As expected, foraging sites also had plants with more crude protein and digestible energy. Traveling sites also had vegetation with significantly more crude protein than random locations. Our results highlight the importance of upland habitats for wood bison in boreal forests for particular behaviors and nutrition. We suggest consideration of multiple behavioral states when assessing habitat suitability. These considerations are especially important when evaluating habitat for reintroductions and/or habitat reclamation.

AB  - The Tarim red deer Cervus hanglu has been recently recognized as a separate deer species with populations in China, Central Asia and Kashmir. These populations are few, isolated and at risk of extinction. The documented range of the Kashmir population of the hangul, now recognized as Cervus hanglu hanglu, is restricted to c. 808 km(2) and comprises < 200 individuals, confined mainly to the 141 km(2 )Dachigam National Park. A few relict herds inhabit the surrounding landscape. Here we analyse the results of almost 20 years of population monitoring (January 2001-March 2020). We found that this population is unable to increase despite full protection within Dachigam National Park. We performed a population viability analysis using both deterministic and stochastic simulations and found that further population decrease is likely. We recommend the use of improved monitoring methods to investigate the population dynamics of the hangul and the implementation of measures to reduce the risk of extinction faced by this small population. Science-based conservation policies, including ex situ conservation and reintroduction programmes, will be required to increase the hangul population size and range.

AB  - Mixed-species tree plantations have additional ecological benefits over single-species tree plantations, such as habitat restoration and increasing biodiversity. However, changes in the soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus storages and stoichiometry after mixed afforestation with the N-fixing tree species under the "Grain for Green Project" in the Loess Plateau of China are not well understood. Typical restoration types, including the mixed plantations of Pinus tabuliformis with Hippophae rhamnoides (HrPt) and Robinia pseudoacacia with H. rhamnoides (HrRp), as well as the pure forests of P. tabuliformis (P-t) and R. pseudoacacia (R-p), were chosen to examine changes in the storages and stoichiometry of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) in 0-100 cm soil layers. The results showed that compared with the corresponding pure forest, HrRp significantly increased the SOC content in the 0-20 cm soil layer and the SOC storage in the 0-100 cm layer, while HrPt significantly increased the SOC content in the 0-10 cm layer, but there was no significant difference for SOC storage in the 0-100 cm layer between P-t and HrPt. Similarly, HrRp significantly increased the TN content in the 0-10 cm layer and the TN storage in the 0-100 cm layer, but there was no significant difference in TN storage between P-t and HrPt. Furthermore, HrRp significantly increased the TP content in the 0-100 cm layer and TP storage was higher than that of R-p, while there were no significant differences in TP content and storage between P-t and HrPt. In the 0-10 cm soil layer, HrRp significantly reduced C:N and increased N:P, but HrPt significantly increased C:P. In addition, compared with the pure forest, the soil physical and chemical properties had a stronger control effect on the soil storages and stoichiometric ratios in the mixed forests. In summary, compared with P. tabuliformis, the introduction of N-fixing tree species into the R. pseudoacacia forest was more conducive to the accumulation of SOC, TN, and TP reserves and the improvement of the N and P utilization efficiency. These results have important implications for the restoration of degraded vegetation and scientific management of mixed plantations on the Loess Plateau and can provide basic data for the assessment of soil quality at the regional scale.

AB  - Wire-snare poaching is increasingly recognized as a major threat to endangered large carnivores in Africa and Asia. However, empirical information on the extent and distribution of snaring remains extremely limited beyond anecdotal reports presenting opportunistically collected data. In this study, we compile information to present a comprehensive synopsis of snaring of critically endangered Sumatran tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae). Hunted for their parts and skins, Sumatran tigers remain in high demand in illicit international markets. We focus our analysis on the provinces of Aceh and North Sumatra, Indonesia, which cumulatively contain similar to 36 % of the island's remaining tiger habitat. Based on records collected from a combination of Indonesian government data, ranger patrol observations, and content analysis of local media, we identified 13 tiger snaring hotspots and documented 28 verified incidents of ensnared tigers between March 2008-March 2023. These totals represent minimum estimates because of spatiotemporal gaps in ranger patrols and inconsistent reporting of snaring by local communities. Our analysis of the incidents reveals tiger mortality in 9 (32.1 %) of the cases and permanent moves to ex-situ settings due to amputation or other debilitating snaring-induced injuries in another 8 (28.6 %) cases. Tiger snaring was positively correlated with forest-edge habitats in the Leuser Ecosystem, where 64.3 % of all incidents occurred. Across both provinces, 28.6 % of all snared tigers were allegedly captured in snares set in agricultural areas to control wild boar. To maximize efficacy of the government's ongoing anti-snare campaigns, we recommend increased personnel for ranger patrols and more attention on tiger-specific snaring impacts.

AB  - Cycles of glacial expansion and contraction throughout the Pleistocene drove increases and decreases, respectively, in the geographical range and population size of many animal species. Genetic data have revealed that during glacial maxima the distribution of many Eurasian animals was restricted to small refugial areas, from which species expanded to reoccupy parts of their former range as the climate warmed. It has been suggested that the extinct eastern moa (Emeus crassus)-a large, flightless bird from New Zealand-behaved analogously during glacial maxima, possibly surviving only in a restricted area of lowland habitat in the southern South Island of New Zealand during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). However, previous studies have lacked the power and geographical sampling to explicitly test this hypothesis using genetic data. Here we analyse 46 ancient mitochondrial genomes from Late Pleistocene and Holocene bones of the eastern moa from across their post-LGM distribution. Our results are consistent with a post-LGM increase in the population size and genetic diversity of eastern moa. We also demonstrate that genetic diversity was higher in eastern moa from the southern extent of their range, supporting the hypothesis that they expanded from a single glacial refugium following the LGM.

AB  - Communities are shaped by a variety of ecological and environmental processes, each acting at different spatial scales. Seminal research on rocky shores highlighted the effects of consumers as local determinants of primary productivity and community assembly. However, it is now clear that the species interactions shaping communities at local scales are themselves regulated by large-scale oceanographic processes that generate regional variation in resource availability. Upwelling events deliver nutrient-rich water to coastal ecosystems, influencing primary productivity and algae-herbivore interactions. Despite the potential for upwelling to alter top-down control by herbivores, we know relatively little about the coupling between oceanographic processes and herbivory on tropical rocky shores, where herbivore effects on producers are considered to be strong and nutrient levels are considered to be limiting. By replicating seasonal molluscan herbivore exclusion experiments across three regions exposed to varying intensity of seasonal upwelling, separated by hundreds of kilometers along Panama's Pacific coast, we examine large-scale environmental determinants of consumer effects and community structure on tropical rocky shores. At sites experiencing seasonal upwelling, grazers strongly limited macroalgal cover when upwelling was absent, leading to dominance by crustose algae. As nutrients increased and surface water cooled during upwelling events, increases in primary productivity temporarily weakened herbivory, allowing foliose, turf and filamentous algae to replace crusts. Meanwhile, grazer effects were persistently strong at sites without seasonal upwelling. Our results confirm that herbivores are key determinants of tropical algal cover, and that the mollusk grazing guild can control initial stages of macroalgal succession. However, our focus on regional oceanographic conditions revealed that bottom-up processes regulate top-down control on tropical shorelines. This study expands on the extensive body of work highlighting the influence of upwelling on local ecological processes by demonstrating that nutrient subsidies delivered by upwelling events can weaken herbivory in tropical rocky shores.

AB  - Due to high costs and time constraints, it can be difficult for traditional field-based methods to acquire sufficient data to identify priority species or areas in marine conservation planning. Local ecological knowledge (LEK) is increasingly used as an important source of information for evidence-based management strategies, but its usefulness for informing conservation prioritization for threatened marine species has rarely been assessed. Here, we conducted the first range-wide systematic survey of five marine megafauna (Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Indo-Pacific finless porpoise, dugong, whale shark, sea turtles) using interviews with fishers in the northern South China Sea (SCS), one of the richest marine biodiversity hotspots in the world, to assess the ability of LEK to highlight priority species and areas for conservation. Our results reveal that the dugong has become functionally extinct in China, while the Indo-Pacific finless porpoise, whale shark, and sea turtles have all experienced more severe declines compared to the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin. Based on the sighting histories of these threatened species, regional conservation priorities and management activities should therefore focus on reducing disturbance pressure in the Beibu Gulf and eastern Guangdong for the Indo-Pacific finless porpoise and in eastern/southern Hainan Island for the whale shark and sea turtles. These findings challenge current conservation strategies that prioritize the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin in the SCS, suggesting that coastal dolphins might not be good indicators of the population trends of sympatric marine megafauna. While LEK cannot provide precise abundance and habitat data for highly threatened marine species, we demonstrate that it offers comparable long-term population trend and wide-scale distribution data to inform the prioritization of conservation actions.

AB  - Selection on plant functional traits may occur through their direct effects on fitness (or a fitness component), or may be mediated by attributes of plant performance which have a direct impact on fitness. Understanding this link is particularly challenging for long-lived organisms, such as forest trees, where lifetime fitness assessments are rarely achievable, and performance features and fitness components are usually quantified from early-life history stages. Accordingly, we studied a cohort of trees from multiple populations of Eucalyptus pauciflora grown in a common-garden field trial established at the hot and dry end of the species distribution on the island of Tasmania, Australia. We related the within-population variation in leaf economic (leaf thickness, leaf area and leaf density) and hydraulic (stomatal density, stomatal length and vein density) traits, measured from two-year-old plants, to two-year growth performance (height and stem diameter) and to a fitness component (seven-year survival). When performance-trait relationships were modelled for all traits simultaneously, statistical support for direct effects on growth performance was only observed for leaf thickness and leaf density. Performance-based estimators of directional selection indicated that individuals with reduced leaf thickness and increased leaf density were favoured. Survival-performance relationships were consistent with size-dependent mortality, with fitness-based selection gradients estimated for performance measures providing evidence for directional selection favouring individuals with faster growth. There was no statistical support for an effect associated with the fitness-based quadratic selection gradient estimated for growth performance. Conditional on a performance measure, fitness-based directional selection gradients estimated for the leaf traits did not provide statistical support for direct effects of the focal traits on tree survival. This suggested that, under the environmental conditions of the trial site and time period covered in the current study, early-stage selection on the studied leaf traits may be mediated by their effects on growth performance, which in turn has a positive direct influence on later-age survival. We discuss the potential mechanistic basis of the direct effects of the focal leaf traits on tree growth, and the relevance of a putative causal pathway of trait effects on fitness through mediation by growth performance in the studied hot and dry environment.

AB  - Many well-studied animal species use conspicuous, repetitive signals that attract both mates and predators. Orthopterans (crickets, katydids, and grasshoppers) are renowned for their acoustic signals. In Neotropical forests, however, many katydid species produce extremely short signals, totaling only a few seconds of sound per night, likely in response to predation by acoustically orienting predators. The rare signals of these katydid species raises the question of how they find conspecific mates in a structurally complex rainforest. While acoustic mechanisms, such as duetting, likely facilitate mate finding, we test the hypothesis that mate finding is further facilitated by colocalization on particular host plant species. DNA barcoding allows us to identify recently consumed plants from katydid stomach contents. We use DNA barcoding to test the prediction that katydids of the same species will have closely related plant species in their stomach. We do not find evidence for dietary specialization. Instead, katydids consumed a wide mix of plants within and across the flowering plants (27 species in 22 genera, 16 families, and 12 orders) with particular representation in the orders Fabales and Laurales. Some evidence indicates that katydids may gather on plants during a narrow window of rapid leaf out, but additional investigations are required to determine whether katydid mate finding is facilitated by gathering at transient food resources.

AB  - approximate to 75% of emerging pathogens originating from wildlife. However, viral diversity within wildlife remains insufficiently explored. This work performs an extensive analysis of 57 536 publicly high-throughput sequencing datasets from wild mammals and birds, resulting in the generation of approximate to 613.45 million assembled contigs, including 131 509 potential viral contigs identified through BLASTn and BLASTx searches. Following the exclusion of index hopping contamination, 9788 are categorized into 25 viral families with known zoonotic potential. These results indicate significant spatial and host-specific variability in viral distribution and reveal a positive correlation between viral diversity and host biodiversity. Rodents, bats, ungulates, and anseriformes exhibit the highest viral diversity. Notably, 50% of the viral sequences exhibit <90% amino acid identity to known viruses, indicating of potential novel viruses. Host-virus network uncovers 458 associations, 67.9% are unreported. Further, sequences of avian influenza viruses are identified in goats, while SARS-CoV-2 are detected in goats, ferrets, porpoises, cactus mice, and house finches. These findings highlight the largely uncharacterized viral diversity in wildlife, underscore the urgent requirement for surveillance at the wildlife-livestock interfaces. Additionally, this work develop the Animal Pathogen Decoding Platform, to facilitate the retrieval and analysis of viral contigs, thereby reducing computational redundancies in future research.

AB  - Sampling method decisions are critical for the effective monitoring and management of fisheries. Deploying the most effective sampling methodologies is particularly important when responding to new invasive species, where early response efforts have the best chances for eradication. In the Laurentian Great Lakes, the invasive Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella is sampled using boat electrofishing and the combination method of boat electrofishing within and around a trammel net enclosure. We conducted a field study to compare the effectiveness of the two methods. We used capture data for surrogate taxa (i.e., Common Carp Cyprinus carpio and buffalo Ictiobus spp.) to compare the two methods because few Grass Carp were collected during the study. The sampling methods were compared within an occupancy modeling framework using an information-criteria model selection approach to evaluate seven alternative models. The base model included sampling method, year, water temperature, and sampling effort as covariates in the detection submodel and assumed that occupancy probability was constant across sites. The other six models built on the base model by including site, water body type (i.e., lentic vs. lotic), and interaction covariates in the detection submodel. The top-performing model, built on the base model, accounted for the influence of water body type and assumed the exchangeability of site effects in the detection submodel. The results indicated that the detection probabilities for both taxa were higher for the combination method than for boat electrofishing, with a median estimated difference in detection probability between the two methods of 0.11 (95% CI: 0.04-0.22) for Common Carp and 0.18 (95% CI: 0.08-0.28) for buffalo. Given that the combination method was more effective for detecting the surrogate taxa, we expect the combination method may be preferable to only boat electrofishing for Grass Carp removal.

AB  - Introduction Protected areas (PAs) are central to global biodiversity conservation as they preserve nature, ecosystems, and cultural values. In South Africa, PAs were historically governed through top-down, exclusionary models rooted in colonial legacies that prioritized ecological protection over community rights and knowledge. This approach limited local access, fostered resentment, and increased management challenges such as poaching. Subsequently, conservation discourse has shifted toward participatory governance, community-based natural resource management (CBNRM), and co-management to promote more equitable and sustainable outcomes. This study explores the extent and nature of local community participation in environmental conservation at Addo Elephant National Park in South Africa, using the lens of Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM).Method This was a qualitative case study research, which used purposive and convenient sampling techniques to recruit a sample of 34 participants. Interviews, focus groups and field observations were used to collect data from the participants, which was then thematically analysed.Results Findings reveal a tripartite model of community engagement: structured involvement through local NGOs, government-led initiatives such as the Extended Public Works Programme, and isolated voluntary actions driven by cultural values.Discussion While formal participation programmes provide economic incentives that mobilize participation, individual efforts, particularly among women, reflect a deep-rooted, intrinsic commitment to environmental stewardship. The study concludes that sustainable conservation requires an integrated approach that combines institutional support with recognition of informal, culturally embedded practices.

AB  - Megafauna, such as southern elephant seals (SESs) (Mirounga leonina, Linn.), forage in diverse, seemingly lim-itless habitats. In pelagic settings, their behaviour is more likely to be limited by physiological ability and prey distribution, than physical barriers. For elephant seals, their rapid growth in body size corresponds to changing physiological abilities. These changes are most pronounced for male elephant seals. While most studies have compared male and female SESs in terms of changing body size and physiological ability, few studies have compared the influence of changing body size on behaviour of male SESs from the same population using long term satellite tracking data. We describe age-related differences in movement and diving behaviour for male SESs from Marion Island. We analysed satellite tracking data collected from 23 male SESs seals fitted with Sea Mammal Research Unit Satellite Relay Data Loggers at Marion Island between 2005 and 2011. Each dive was assigned a behavioural mode, either 'searching' or 'transit', using state-space modelling. We used mixed-effects models to quantify the influence of age and behavioural mode on dive duration, surface duration, dive depth and number of daily dives. Younger seals travelled significantly further from Marion Island and spent most of their dives in transit mode, whereas older seals stayed closer to the island but were in searching mode for most of their tracks. When searching, older seals dived more frequently, displayed longer dive and surface durations, and reached greater depths than younger seals. These differences in diving behaviour seem to reflect changing physiological ability. For male SESs, changes in physiological ability necessitate behavioural plasticity, which may be the key to survival and future breeding success. Robust males are more likely to breed and must therefore, maintain their body size by adapting to local oceanic conditions.

AB  - Monitoring is critical to assess management effectiveness, but broadscale systematic assessments of monitoring to evaluate and improve recovery efforts are lacking. We compiled 1808 time series from 71 threatened and near-threatened terrestrial and volant mammal species and subspecies in Australia (48% of all threatened mammal taxa) to compare relative trends of populations subject to different management strategies. We adapted the Living Planet Index to develop the Threatened Species Index for Australian Mammals and track aggregate trends for all sampled threatened mammal populations and for small (< 35 g), medium (35-5500 g), and large mammals (> 5500 g) from 2000 to 2017. Unmanaged populations (42 taxa) declined by 63% on average; unmanaged small mammals exhibited the greatest declines (96%). Populations of 17 taxa in havens (islands and fenced areas that excluded or eliminated introduced red foxes [Vulpes vulpes] and domestic cats [Felis catus]) increased by 680%. Outside havens, populations undergoing sustained predator baiting initially declined by 75% but subsequently increased to 47% of their abundance in 2000. At sites where predators were not excluded or baited but other actions (e.g., fire management, introduced herbivore control) occurred, populations of small and medium mammals declined faster, but large mammals declined more slowly, than unmanaged populations. Only 13% of taxa had data for both unmanaged and managed populations; index comparisons for this subset showed that taxa with populations increasing inside havens declined outside havens but taxa with populations subject to predator baiting outside havens declined more slowly than populations with no management and then increased, whereas unmanaged populations continued to decline. More comprehensive and improved monitoring (particularly encompassing poorly represented management actions and taxonomic groups like bats and small mammals) is required to understand whether and where management has worked. Improved implementation of management for threats other than predation is critical to recover Australia's threatened mammals.

AB  - Self-organized forest communities (FCs) have governed common forests in a sustainable way in Europe for centuries. In most CEE countries, this tradition was interrupted by the communist regime in the second half of the 20th century. The social demand for non-provisioning forest ecosystem services (FES) is increasing nowadays and FCs could play a significant role in their provision. However, FCs are currently facing many challenges, e.g., climate change, loss of income or changing social values. The paper investigates (i) the role of self-organized FCs in innovative forest governance and sustainable FES provision and (ii) specific conditions and fostering/hindering factors affecting implementation of innovative forest governance schemes by FCs in CEE. Factors influencing forest governance innovations in two FCs in Czechia and Slovakia were identified and discussed during workshops, focus groups and semi-structured interviews with their members and stakeholders. It was shown that self-organized FCs could play a pioneering role in implementation of innovations as they are open to novel solutions and have the ability to flexibly and collectively respond to new challenges. Emphasis on non-provisioning FES, cooperation of actors, strong leadership and introduction of financial compensations are key fostering factors. In contrast, factors related to institutional settings (e.g., current legislative environment) are perceived as hindering.

AB  - This study proposes monitoring methods of wild boars in plains or mountain forest areas using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with infrared cameras. It is recommended to monitor in winter when the canopy layer is thin and the temperature difference between the ambient temperature and the body temperature of the wild boar is distinct, so that the infrared camera can better detect the wild boars. In flat land, the plane movement of the UAV can be easily monitored using the line transect, the point count survey, the plot sampling method, and the belted transect. In the mountain forest, there are variations in elevation due to slopes. Therefore, we introduced the WAYPOINT function to reflect the difference in altitude. After the investigator designates the waypoint, various information can be modified according to the terrain, and the WAYPOINT can be transmitted to other UAVs, so the utilization is high. In this method, once a route is created using the WAYPOINT, there is no need for additional operation after the start of the flight, and it helps to re-monitor the site by using the WAYPOINT record repeatedly. Therefore, this technical note provides a more repeatedly sustainable and scalable monitoring method than the conventional UAV method.

AB  - Biodiversity loss is a consequence of socio-ecological processes. Observations on anthropogenic actions toward ecosystems coupled to observations on ecosystem metrics are needed to help understand these processes so that ecosystem management policies can be derived and implemented to curb such destruction. Such data needs to be maintained in searchable data portals. To this end, this article delivers a first-of-its-kind relational database of observations on coupled anthropogenic and ecosystem actions. This Ecosystem Management Actions Taxonomy (EMAT) database is founded on a taxonomy designed to support models of political-ecological processes. Structured query language scripts for building and querying these databases are described. The use of episodes in the construction of political-ecological theory is also introduced. These are frequently occurring sequences of political-ecological actions. Those episodes that test positive for causality can aid in improving a political-ecological theory by driving modifications to an attendant computational model so that it generates them. Two relational databases of political-ecological actions are described that are built from online news articles and published data on species abundance. The first concerns the management of the East African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) population, and the second is focused on the management of rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum) in South Africa. The cheetah database is used to study the political drivers of cheetah habitat loss, and the rhino database is used study the political drivers of rhino poaching. An EMAT database is a fundamental breakthrough because is provides a language for conservation science to identify the objects and phenomena that it is about. Therefore, maintaining political-ecological data in EMAT databases will advance conservation science and consequently, improve management policies that are based on that science.

AB  - Despite rapid advances in sensor development and technological miniaturization, it remains challenging to non-invasively record small-amplitude electrophysiological signals from an animal in its natural environment. Many advances in ecophysiology and biologging have arisen through sleep studies, which rely on detecting small signals over multiple days and minimal disruption of natural animal behavior. This paper describes the development of a surface-mounted system that has allowed novel electrophysiological recordings of sleep in wild marine mammals. We discuss our iterative design process by providing sensor-comparison data, detailed technical illustrations, and material recommendations. We describe the system's performance over multiple days in 12 freely moving northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) sleeping on land and in water in captivity and the wild. We leverage advances in signal processing by applying independent components analysis and inertial motion sensor calibrations to maximize signal quality across large (> 10 gigabyte), multi-day datasets. Our study adds to the suite of biologging tools available to scientists seeking to understand the physiology and behavior of wild animals in the context in which they evolved.

AB  - Periphyton community grown on submerged substrate in water could serve as a preferred natural food item to herbivorous and omnivorous fish and crustacean species. To determine the optimum substrate area for the growth of periphyton biomass serving as natural food and to reduce the requirement of pellet feed quantity, a 150-day pond experiment was conducted with four treatments of brackishwater polyculture: total feeding and no periphyton substrate (P0), and partial feeding with periphyton grown on nylon net substrate equivalent to 50 (P50), 75 (P75) and 100 (P100) % of pond surface area. Each treatment had three randomly assigned replicate ponds (50 m2). After 15 days of substrate fixation in the surface layer of ponds up to 50 cm water depth, stocking was made with seeds of Mugil cephalus Linnaeus, 1758, Planiliza parsia (Hamilton, 1822), Chanos chanos (Forsskal, 1775) and Penaeus monodon Fabricius, 1798 at 1800, 18000, 2000 and 30,000 number ha- 1, respectively. A low-cost pellet feed (30.76% crude protein) was provided at 6-3% of fish biomass per day. Dry matter (DM) of periphyton biomass was estimated from each replicate pond under P50, P75 and P100 from 15 x 15 cm2 net substrate, and then total periphyton DM was calculated according to the substrate surface area at 15-day intervals. Then, the total periphyton biomass was divided to find out daily DM availability. The feed amount in P50, P75 and P100 ponds was reduced proportionately to the equivalent daily periphyton DM availability and the feeding at this reduced quantity was continued for 15 days. The experiment revealed significantly lower levels of nitrogenous and phosphorus compounds, and dissolved organic carbon content in water of P75 and P100, compared to that of P0 and P50 (P < 0.05) and there were interaction effects of experimental period and periphyton substrate area on these parameters. All the species had an increasing growth pattern with experimental period and there was an interaction effect of experimental period and periphyton substrate area on growth of these species, indicating periphyton had positive effects. The highest specific growth rate was recorded in P. monodon and the lowest was in M. cephalus. Pooled survival of fishes and shrimp, and total productivity did not differ among treatments (P > 0.05). Although, the highest level of feed reduction (42%) by the utilization of periphyton biomass was in P100, P75 performed better in terms of productivity and economic return with 30% feed reduction in polyculture. Similarly, there was 26-41% reduction in feed conversion ratio with the highest level being in P100 (41%), followed by P75 (40%) in comparison to P0. Moreover, carcass composition of cultured fishes and shrimp indicated that periphyton based systems with partial feeding could meet up the nutrient requirement of the animals with no negative effects in comparison to the feed-based system. Therefore, this study suggests that provision of periphyton substrate equivalent to 75% of pond surface area along with partial feeding is the most appropriate approach for achieving higher return with environmental sustainability in brackishwater polyculture.

AB  - Under adaptive management, operational adjustments from planning to monitoring aim to promote plant diversity and enhance forest resilience. We evaluated the long-term effects (> 25 years) of shelterwood harvesting on the taxonomic and functional diversity of vascular plants in Nothofagus dombeyi, N. obliqua and N. alpina (Nothofagaceae) forests of north-western Patagonia. The study was conducted in three sites (West, Middle, and East) located along a west-east precipitation gradient. Changes in plant diversity between managed (m) and unmanaged (u) forest were assessed using linear models, multivariate analyses and network approaches. We recorded 63 plant species, 34 of which were endemic to Patagonia. Chusquea culeou (Poaceae) and Nothofagus regeneration (diameter at breast height < 10 cm) were dominant, except in the East managed forest. Life form and management were associated per site. Managed forests showed higher Dq= 2 alpha diversity, while beta diversity was affected by site and management. Unmanaged forests in the West and Middle sites had similar compositions, while the East unmanaged forest had a high number of unique species. In the managed West and Middle sites, silviculture increased spatial heterogeneity and promoted Nothofagus regeneration. In contrast, the managed East site displayed more homogenous microsites with higher Poaceae frequency and bare soil coverage. These findings highlight the complex role of silviculture in shaping plant communities under varying environmental conditions, emphasizing the importance of long-term studies across environmental gradients to guide adaptive forest management.

AB  - Coevolution between plants and their animal predators has led to diverse defensive adaptations. Multiple theories of defense propose that there are resource allocation costs associated with producing chemical defenses. One leading hypothesis, optimal defense theory (ODT), suggests that natural selection will result in the allocation of resources to defenses that optimize the cost-to-benefit ratio between defense and other functional processes. The population decline of the rare subalpine wetland species, Arizona willow (Salix arizonica), has been attributed to various biotic and abiotic factors, with browsing from wild and domestic ungulates as a significant concern for at least three decades. In a field experiment using natural populations, we compare the relationship between phytochemical defense and height in Arizona willows with and without long-term protection from browsing via browse exclosures. Consistent with the predictions of ODT, individuals with physical protection from ungulate browsing for multiple years had significantly lower phenolic glycoside (PG) concentrations and increased plant height compared to unprotected individuals. A similar pattern was found across all individuals, whereby total PG concentration and height were negatively correlated. In a short-term experiment in natural populations, changes in levels of defense were not observed when plants received protection for only one growing season. The contrasting pattern of defense plasticity in response to long-term versus short-term physical protection suggests a differential plastic response in this long-lived species. Delayed reduction in PG concentration may serve as a benefit to avoid mismatches between environmental cues and responses. Our research sheds light on the intricate dynamics between plant-defense strategies, environmental pressures, and evolutionary adaptations in shaping plant-browser interactions.

AB  - The rapidly growing industry of crop biostimulants leverages the application of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) to promote plant growth and health. However, introducing nonnative rhizobacteria may impact other aspects of ecosystem functioning and have legacy effects; these potential consequences are largely unexplored. Nontarget consequences of PGPR may include changes in resident microbiomes, nutrient cycling, pollinator services, functioning of other herbivores, disease suppression, and organic matter persistence. Importantly, we lack knowledge of whether these ecosystem effects may manifest in adjacent ecosystems. The introduced PGPR can leave a functional legacy whether they persist in the community or not. Legacy effects include shifts in resident microbiomes and their temporal dynamics, horizontal transfer of genes from the PGPR to resident taxa, and changes in resident functional groups and interaction networks. Ecosystem functions may be affected by legacies PGPR leave following niche construction, such as when PGPR alter soil pH that in turn alters biogeochemical cycling rates. Here, we highlight new research directions to elucidate how introduced PGPR impact resident microbiomes and ecosystem functions and their capacity for legacy effects.

AB  - Alien plants grown in urban areas can spread through natural and anthropogenic ecosystems, adversely impacting native biota. Propagule pressure (i.e., seed, individual, and introduction number) increases the spreading probability, but native herbivorous predators can limit it via biotic resistance. Parrots are primary consumers, and although they interact antagonistically with alien plants, their role in biotic resistance seems overlooked. Here, we highlight the potential role of urban parrots in biotic resistance based on florivory activity in Gliricidia sepium (Fabaceae), an alien tree with invasive traits. We performed focal observations on four G. sepium trees planted in an urbanized area in Brazil to assess parrot florivory magnitude. As a complement, we performed road transects to record food plants and determine whether parrots prefer G. sepium over native plants, a significant fact from the perspective of biotic resistance. Parrots prey on 33% of G. sepium flower crops in 16 h, presumably resulting in seed loss for recruitment - florivory occurs before fruit and seed formation and may characterize a type of predispersal seed predation. Three parrot species preferred G. sepium flowers to some native food plant species. Our investigation suggests that parrots potentially provide biotic resistance in urbanized areas by exerting high predation pressure on the reproductive structures of alien plants. Maintaining native urban parrots can be a conservation tool to resist invasion by alien plant species. Parrot food plants, mainly native ones, should be urban greening options to enhance this ecological function.

AB  - Herbivorous waterfowl populations have increasingly adapted to forage on agricultural land and triggered a parallel rise in damage to agricultural crops. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) is the most commonly reported crop damaged in northern Europe, and farmers increasingly demand management actions to mitigate economic impacts. Here, we apply two parallel approaches (exclosure experiments in undisturbed fields and yield assessments in fields subject to scaring) to quantify the impact of waterfowl grazing on winter wheat yield, crop height and nutrient content. We demonstrate that waterfowl grazing led to a substantial reduction in crop height during winter and early spring, but also that compensatory growth led to no significant effect on crop height at the time of harvest. In terms of grain yield, the effect of waterfowl grazing varied from non-significant to a 6% loss, and on fields subject to scaring, the negative effect of grazing was only significant when grazing continued into spring (the case for 7.6% of the area sampled). In addition, the exclosure experiments indicated that plots grazed both winter and spring had a protein content 9% lower than ungrazed plots. While these figures express an economic loss to the affected farmers, our findings also indicate that substantial economic impacts from grazing waterfowl on winter wheat was rare in our study area. This may also be the case elsewhere in the temperate region, when most waterfowl abandon crop foraging in due time to allow for compensatory growth in late spring, and as long as the early developmental stages survive the early impacts from grazing. A substantial scaring effort had only a limited effect on grain yield loss when fields were grazed during spring, but seemed to prevent damage on fields that were grazed only during winter. Future decision-making in relation to the waterfowl-agriculture conflict may benefit from studies looking in-depth at the costs and benefits associated with scaring efforts.

AB  - In Australia, fire has become part of the natural ecosystem. Severe fires have devastated Australia's unique forest ecosystems due to the global climate change. In this study, we integrated a multi-resolution segmentation method and a hierarchical classification framework based on expert-based knowledge to classify the burned areas and land-uses in Kangaroo Island, South Australia. Using an object-based image classification framework that combines colour and shape features from input layers, we demonstrated that the objects segmented from the multi-source data lead to a higher accuracy in classification with an overall accuracy of 90.2% and a kappa coefficient of 85.2%. On the other hand, the single source data from post-fire Landsat-8 imagery showed an overall accuracy of 87.4% which is also statistically acceptable. According to our experiment results, more than 30.44% of the study area was burned during the 2019-2020 'Black-Summer' fire season in Australia. Among the burned areas, high severity accounted for 12.14%, moderate severity for 11.48%, while low severity was 6.82%. For unburned areas, farmland accounted for 45.52% of the study area, of which about one-third was affected by the disturbances other than fire. The remaining area consists of 19.42% unaffected forest, 3.48% building and bare land, and 1.14% water. The comparison analysis shows that our object-based image classification framework takes full advantage of the multi-source data and generates the edges of burned areas more clearly, which contributes to the improved fire management and control.

AB  - African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) have been recognised as ecosystem engineers, where their feeding habits have been shown to alter landscapes. Within small, fenced reserves, studies exploring elephant damage on trees and their recovery have overlooked secondary damages that could be contributing to tree mortality. The aim of this study is to assess the significance of both elephant damage and secondary damage, and the subsequent tree recovery. We identified secondary damage as insects and considered wood borers and termites in this study. This was conducted in in the small fenced Karongwe Private Game Reserve, South Africa. We analysed the level of damage, recovery and insect presence using vegetation transects, where all trees >= 2 m in height were surveyed (n = 1278 trees). Forty tree species were recorded, with 5 species accounting for 77% of the data set and used for further analysis. Termites were found to be more likely to colonise damaged trees without signs of recovery. However, wood borers were more likely to colonise damaged trees showing signs of recovery. Termites and wood borer presence on damaged trees was not dependent on tree height. We suggest carefully considering management approaches for elephant-induced termite and wood borer damage on trees.

AB  - The Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH) suggests that the absence of natural enemies (herbivores, parasites, and diseases) in non-native environments allow exotic plants to allocate more resources towards growth and reproduction, resulting in increased invasiveness. This study uses the submerged macrophyte Lagarosiphon major (Ridl.) Moss ex Wager (Hydrocharitaceae), native to Southern Africa, as a case study of this hypothesis. This species is invasive in many parts of the world, including Ireland, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Here, we investigate the applicability of the ERH in explaining the invasiveness of L. major in New Zealand. This was achieved by comparing L. major biomass and cover, and plant species richness between L. major's native range in South Africa and its invaded range in New Zealand, where specialist natural enemies were presumed to be lacking. The findings revealed significantly higher L. major biomass (similar to 100 % increase), cover (similar to 28 % increase) and shoot production (similar to 91 % increase) in the invaded range compared to the native range. Additionally, overall species richness and abundance was negatively correlated with L. major abundance in the invaded range. Plants in the native range were associated with more natural enemies and experienced higher levels of damage relative to the invaded sites. Overall, these observations align with the ERH, but should be interpreted with caution as other influential factors such as competition were not measured. Nevertheless, this suggests that L. major could benefit from the integration of biological control measures with the existing methods of control. Two natural enemies, Polypedilum tuburcinatum Andersen (Diptera: Chironomidae) and Hydrellia lagarosiphon Deeming (Diptera: Ephydridae) have already been identified as promising candidates, for biological control of L. major in New Zealand and other regions invaded by this weed.

AB  - Reeves' muntjac, either deliberately released or escaped from collections, was present in a few areas of southern England in low numbers by the 1960s and was generally regarded as a benign introduction. As their numbers and distribution increased their impact on amenity woodland, forest plantations, ground flora and their potential competition with native herbivores became apparent. Their reproductive capabilities and ability to thrive in various habitats enabled them to become extremely successful invasive aliens, now established throughout much of England (887 10 km squares, almost all contiguous, in 2016), and a few locations in Wales and Northern Ireland. The species is included within the E.U. list of Invasive Aliens of Union Concern stemming from Regulation (EU) 1143/2014. The UK has the longest experience with free-living muntjac, so it is useful to examine in detail the history of introduction, subsequent spread and aspects of its ecology. This offers a useful case-history and exemplar for possible future range expansion in other European countries where the species is now becoming better-established.

AB  - Differing values between communities and government resource managers may lead to conflict, particularly when community members are not involved in decision making. Increasingly, co-management arrangements have become an important tool to increase local capacity for resource management, increase trust between diverse community groups, and foster effective stewardship. However, co-management depends upon collaboration between users and managers and the ability to understand relationships between a given resource and those who use it, even when these communities are often viewed as contravening conservation efforts. Invasive species, such as feral pigs (Sus scrofa), present particular management challenges because they damage island ecosystems but are also integral to community life ways and food systems. Based on interviews with local pig hunters in the Hawaiian Islands, we explored the social-cultural values and practices of local pig hunters, their reasons for hunting, and possibilities for greater collaboration in feral pig management. Results highlight the importance of hunting for both food and other forms of well-being and cultural perpetuation, along with opportunities for (1) expanding mechanisms of access to improve hunting opportunities for invasive species; (2) integrating rights and responsibilities to meet management objectives; and (3) improving communication to enhance collaborative arrangements. Considering the context of managing community use of an ecologically detrimental invasive species, this study offers insights to guide co-management partnerships with community groups that are sometimes perceived as opposed to invasive species control efforts.

AB  - AimThe biodiversity of the Malay Archipelago is the product of the region's rich biogeographical history with periods of island connectivity and isolation during the Pleistocene glacial cycles. Here, the case of two endemic suid species, the Javan (Sus verrucosus) and Bawean (S. blouchi) warty pigs, was used to illustrate how biogeographic processes and recent anthropogenic pressures can shape demographic histories with significant implications for species conservation. LocationMalay Archipelago, with focus on Bawean and Java. MethodsWe employed genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms from the Porcine SNP60 v2 BeadChip to assess interspecific genetic differentiation, to estimate divergence times and to perform demographic model selection. ResultsIn contrast to the hypothesis of recent divergence during the last glacial maximum, S. blouchi was found to have diverged from S. verrucosus at least 166 k years ago following a founder event. The contemporary S. blouchi population was characterised by a recent bottleneck that reduced the effective population size to less than 20. The genomic assessment supports the single species status of S. blouchi, as was previously proposed based on morphometrics. The demographic history of S. verrucosus showed evidence of secondary contact with the sympatric banded pig (S. scrofa vittatus) that colonised Java 70 k years ago. Main ConclusionsWhile the Javan and Bawean warty pigs have persisted throughout the Pleistocene climatic oscillations, contemporary pressures from human activities threaten their survival and immediate action should be taken to grant legal protection to both S. verrucosus and S. blouchi. This study highlighted the use of demographic history modelling using genomic data to identify evolutionary significant units and inform conservation.

AB  - This paper describes the results of research at Volchia Griva, the largest site in Asia containing mammoth fauna in situ. It is situated in the south of the West Siberian Plain in the Baraba forest-steppe zone, and occupies an area of several hectares. Analysis of sediments and taphonomy of the site allows us to suggest that thousands of megafaunal remains were buried here in mud pits and erosional depressions. The favorable geochemical landscape of Volchia Griva attracted animals during periods of mineral starvation. This is reflected in the high mortality in two intervals, ca. 20-18 C-14 ka BP and ca. 17-11 C-14 ka BP. The results of palynological analysis of samples from the upper part of the Volchia Griva section made it possible to reconstruct the history of landscape changes of the Baraba Lowland during the MIS 2. Forb-mesophytic meadows were common at the beginning of this period, with taiga type forests. At ca. 20 C-14 ka BP, an abrupt and significant aridization of the climate occurred, which led to the degradation of forests. The mammoth steppe was widely developed, dominated by forb-grass association and with areas of alkali meadows and soils. Such conditions existed probably until the mid-Holocene.

AB  - Conservation initiatives strive for reliable and cost-effective species monitoring.1-3 However, resource constraints mean management decisions are overly reliant on data derived from single methodologies, resulting in taxonomic or geographic biases.4 We introduce a data integration framework to optimize species monitoring in terms of spatial representation, the reliability of biodiversity metrics, and the cost of implementation, focusing on tigers and their principal prey (sambar deer and wild pigs). We combined information from unstructured ranger patrols, systematic sign transects, and camera traps in Sumatra's largest remaining tropical forest and used integrated community occupancy models to analyze this multifaceted dataset in a unified way. Data integration improved the precision of species occupancy estimates by 14%-42%, enhanced the accuracy of species inferences, expanded the spatial scope of inference to the landscape level, and cut operational costs up to 51-fold. Our framework demonstrates the underappreciated value of integrating unstructured observations with monitoring data derived from traditional wildlife surveys.

AB  - We describe the results of long-term population monitoring of the island night lizard Xantusia riversiana on San Nicolas Island, California, following the species' removal from the U.S. Endangered Species list in 2014. Monitoring activities were carried out from October 2014 through November 2023, but we also incorporate data from earlier work dating back to 1993. Because of habitat loss on the western part of the island, the island night lizard is almost entirely confined to the island's eastern half. The species' distribution remains largely the same since studies in the 1990s, though small increases in distribution were noted at the island's west end. Numbers at most long-term monitoring sites appeared to show a slight decrease associated with a multi-year drought, with numbers returning to previous levels by the end of the monitoring period. Models fit to counts of newly recruited lizards suggested a positive association between winter precipitation and abundance; however, we found a simpler model including constant abundance throughout the study to be more parsimonious. Two monitoring sites showed marked decreases in numbers, with one site declining to zero following infestation of the area by non-native Argentine ants Linepithema humile. The island's vegetation and natural communities continue to gradually recover from a century of overgrazing by sheep and the widespread introduction of aggressive non-native plants. Habitat restoration efforts by U.S. Navy natural resources staff on the island may lead to increasing population numbers and genetic connectivity, but persistent threats remain for the island night lizard on San Nicolas Island.

AB  - We assessed changes in the population size, density, and diet composition of wolves inhabiting the Romincka Forest (RF), an area of 480 km2 situated along the state border between Poland, Russian Federation (Kaliningrad), and Lithuania. We compared the results of our research in 2020-2021 with data from other projects conducted since 1999. We found that both packs living in RF had transboundary territories. The number of packs was stable over 21 years; the average pack size almost doubled (from 4-4.5 to 7.5-8 wolves per pack); the total wolf numbers increased 1.8 times, reaching 15-16 wolves; and the density increased 1.5 times up to 3.1-3.3 wolves/100 km2 in winter 2020/2021. Our analyses of 165 scats revealed that beavers Castor fiber made up 45.6% of food biomass in the wolf diet in 2020, which was 3.4 times more than in 1999-2004 (n = 84 scats,13.4%). Wild ungulates constituted 44.8% of the wolf food biomass in 2020, 1.6 times less than before (71.1%). In our study, among wild ungulates, wolves primarily consumed roe deer Capreolus capreolus (22.6% of food biomass), then wild boars Sus scrofa (13.7%), and red deer Cervus elaphus (5.0%), while moose Alces alces was eaten rarely (0.4%). We also recorded domestic dogs (4.9% of food biomass) and cattle (3.1%). The food niche breadth was wider (B = 2.31) than in the earlier period (B = 1.84), and the Pianka index showed moderate similarity in food composition between both periods (alpha = 0.816). In November 2022, due to the migration crisis, a 199 km impermeable fence along the state border with Kaliningrad was erected, which blocked access to 48% of the RF area that was regularly used by the resident wolf packs. This may cause wolf numbers to decrease and isolation from the central part of the Baltic wolf population to which they belong, according to our DNA analyses.

AB  - IntroductionCystic echinococcosis (CE) is a serious global health concern. CE is an endemic zoonotic disease in Iran. The substantial genetic diversity of Echinococcus granulosus is closely linked to its life cycle, transmission mechanisms and pathogenesis. This study aimed to explore the phylogenetic structure of the genotypes of E. granulosus sensu lato (s.l.) in southwestern Iran (SWI).MethodsSeventy-two hydatid cyst samples were collected from various intermediate hosts, including goats, cattle, sheep, camels, buffalo and humans, primarily from the lungs, liver, spleen and heart of livestock slaughtered in local and industrial abattoirs, as well as from patients in several hospitals (Namazi, Golestan, Arvand and Shahid Beheshti) in southwestern Iran (Bushehr, Fars, Kohgiluyeh and Boyerahmad and Khuzestan provinces).ResultsSequence analysis revealed three genotypes of E. granulosus s.l. in the SWI: G1 (n = 69, 95.8%), G3(n = 1, 1.4%) and genotype like G6/G7 (n = 2, 2.8%). Twenty-one different haplotypes were identified in this study. According to the phylogenetic tree topology, the cox1 gene sequence similarities can be shown for some G1 and G6/G7 isolates in some vast areas, but these genotypes generally show a heterogeneous population worldwide. High similarity was shown between G3 isolates from some countries (Spain, Turkey, India and Iran) and different hosts (sheep, human and buffalo).ConclusionsThe presence of the G6/G7 genotype in the SWI may be due to the transmission of this genotype from other regions or the role of camel/wild boar and other possible intermediate hosts in the expansion of this genotype in the SWI. The results of the present study can be used in CE control programs, molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic studies in Iran and other countries for future goals.

AB  - Marine-derived resource subsidies can generate intrapopulation variation in the behaviors and diets of terrestrial consumers. How omnivores respond, given their multiple trophic interactions, is not well understood. We sampled mice (Peromyscus keeni) and their food sources at five sites on three islands of the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada, to test predictions regarding variation in the spatial behavior and consumption of marine-subsidized foods among individuals. About 50% of detections (n = 27 recaptures) occurred at traps closest to shoreline (25 m), with capture frequencies declining significantly inland (up to 200 m). Stable isotope signatures (delta C-13 and delta N-15), particularly delta N-15, in plant foods, forest arthropod prey, and mouse feces were significantly enriched near shorelines compared with inland, while delta C-13 patterns were more variable. Bayesian isotope mixing models applied to isotope values in mouse hair indicated that over one-third (35-37%) of diet was comprised of beach-dwelling arthropods, a marine-derived food source. Males were more abundant near the shoreline than females and consumed more marine-derived prey, regardless of reproductive status or availability of other food sources. Our results identify how multiple pathways of marine nutrient transfer can subsidize terrestrial omnivores and how subsets of recipient populations can show variation in spatial and dietary response.

AB  - BackgroundPredation pressure and herbivory exert cascading effects on coral reef health and stability. However, the extent of these cascading effects can vary considerably across space and time. This variability is likely a result of the complex interactions between coral reefs' biotic and abiotic dimensions. A major biological component that has been poorly integrated into the reefs' trophic studies is the microbial community, despite its role in coral death and bleaching susceptibility. Viruses that infect bacteria can control microbial densities and may positively affect coral health by controlling microbialization. We hypothesize that viral predation of bacteria has analogous effects to the top-down pressure of macroorganisms on the trophic structure and reef health.ResultsHere, we investigated the relationships between live coral cover and viruses, bacteria, benthic algae, fish biomass, and water chemistry in 110 reefs spanning inhabited and uninhabited islands and atolls across the Pacific Ocean. Statistical learning showed that the abundance of turf algae, viruses, and bacteria, in that order, were the variables best predicting the variance in coral cover. While fish biomass was not a strong predictor of coral cover, the relationship between fish and corals became apparent when analyzed in the context of viral predation: high coral cover (> 50%) occurred on reefs with a combination of high predator fish biomass (sum of sharks and piscivores > 200 g m(-2)) and high virus-to-bacteria ratios (> 10), an indicator of viral predation pressure. However, these relationships were non-linear, with reefs at the higher and lower ends of the coral cover continuum displaying a narrow combination of abiotic and biotic variables, while reefs at intermediate coral cover showed a wider range of parameter combinations.ConclusionsThe results presented here support the hypothesis that viral predation of bacteria is associated with high coral cover and, thus, coral health and stability. We propose that combined predation pressures from fishes and viruses control energy fluxes, inhibiting the detrimental accumulation of ecosystem energy in the microbial food web.

AB  - Resource competition is a key factor in shaping community structure. In herbivorous insects, living space occupation is likely to lead to exclusion due to resource competition with coercion of consuming poor resources. Given that eggs are immobile, their placement is critical for larval survival and development, especially in terms of optimal resource consumption, making oviposition site selection a crucial factor for females. Therefore, competition for oviposition sites may lead to exclusion if resources are scarce. This study examined the competitive relationships among three leaf beetle species (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae): Aspidimorpha difformis (Motschulsky), Aspidimorpha transparipennis (Motschulsky) and Laccoptera nepalensis Boheman. Competitive dynamics were assessed using field surveys, experiments and simulations. Results revealed that habitats for both Aspidimorpha species were less than half the size of L. nepalensis habitats. Additionally, both Aspidimorpha species avoided oviposition on leaves with the oothecae of other species, with A. difformis showing a reduction of up to 70% in ootheca number. Simulation results indicated that only A. difformis, which experienced oviposition site reductions due to other species, faced certain extinction under conditions mimicking natural habitats. Our findings suggest that A. difformis experiences unilateral exclusion due to resource competition for oviposition sites, as observed in the field. Thus, based on our findings, even free-living herbivorous insects can be excluded due to interference competition during their immobile stage, such as eggs.

AB  - The Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant disaster in the To<overline>hoku region of Japan resulted in the release of a large quantity of radionuclides into the environment; while humans were quickly evacuated from the contaminated area, wildlife remained. Changes in human activity and presence can impact habitat use and movement patterns of wild animals across demographic levels, including shifts in resource selection such as incursions into human-abandoned areas. Thus, understanding changes in spatiotemporal patterns of wildlife within humanabandoned landscapes can help mitigate human-wildlife conflict in preparation for anthropogenic resettlement. In this study, we investigated spatial utilization and temporal behaviors of Japanese wild boar (Sus scrofa leucomystax) in and around the Fukushima Exclusion Zone (FEZ). We used GPS data from 34 wild boar within the FEZ to conduct second- and third-order resource selection and movement path analyses. We also included GPS data from seven additional wild boar collared surrounding the FEZ to generate hidden Markov models to compare the temporal trends of wild boar inside the FEZ to wild boar outside the FEZ across three behavioral states (e.g., resting, foraging, traveling). We found that wild boar within the FEZ shifted their activity patterns to be more diurnal than those outside the zone where humans continue to reside. Additionally, while wild boar within the FEZ used natural spaces like forests, individuals also selected for human-abandoned areas such as rice paddy fields and urban areas. Our results provide insights into the adaptability of wildlife following human abandonment following large-scale human displacement events.

AB  - Atlas Barbary sheep, Ammotragus lervia lervia, are the only wild caprinid of Northwest Africa. Some studies have investigated their feeding ecology, but there is no information on intraspecific dietary variation. Therefore, we determined the spring diet and its variation between age-sex classes in Atlas Barbary sheep within a fenced nature reserve in the Western High Atlas mountain range, Morocco. We used faecal microhistological analysis to assess diet composition based on a reference epidermis catalogue. The habitat was a highly diversified open mixed forest with 61 identified species (55 genera; 24 families). The herbaceous layer was dominated by grasses, mainly Stipa capensis. Atlas Barbary sheep revealed to be opportunistic grazers, consuming 44 forage species; grasses and forbs constituted 87% of the overall diet. There were significant intraspecific dietary differences. Rams showed a more diverse (42 species) and distinct diet compared to those of ewes (22 species) and juveniles (lambs + yearlings) (only 10 species). All sex-age classes were mostly grazers, adults feeding on grasses and forbs in similar proportions, whereas juveniles feeding basically on grasses (more than 70% of their diet) and almost no forbs. Ewes and juveniles feed on browse at a higher proportion than rams do. Our findings would be useful for the restoration and management of the habitat and food resources within the reserve.

AB  - This manuscript critically examines the history of non-native aquatic species introductions in Uruguay, emphasizing the role of public institutions. Despite global concerns about biodiversity threats from these introductions, Uruguay's reliance on animal production and aquaculture involving non-native species has grown since the 1980s. State institutions, despite past failures, have promoted these introductions without comprehensive risk assessments. Notable cases, including failed attempts with species like the herbivorous carp, American bullfrog, Nile tilapia, Australian redclaw crayfish, and American mink, raise concerns about invasive populations due to a lack of proper risk assessments and prevention measures. Previous examples were deficient in escape monitoring, oversight of specimens after farm closures, and considerations for the presence of new pathogens. This highlights the need for more informed and responsible approaches to prevent invasive species' establishment, advocating for rigorous analysis and risk assessments before any introduction. We propose overcoming historically fragmented decision-making processes by establishing a bridging structure that coordinates inter- and intra-institutional efforts, engages with the academic sector and social organizations, and evaluates the introductions. This platform can prioritize protecting aquatic ecosystems, fostering sustainable growth, and maintaining ecological balance, contributing to the solution of the problem by facilitating coordinated efforts and engaging diverse stakeholders.

AB  - El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) events drive profound global impacts on marine environments. These events may result in contrasting conditions in the Southern Ocean, with differing effects on euphausiid species because of their diverse life histories, habitats, and feeding ecologies. We conducted oceanographic surveys during winter (2012-2016) around the northern Antarctic Peninsula and examined the dietary carbon sources, trophic position, and body condition of five euphausiid species (Euphausia crystallorophias, E. frigida, E. superba post-larvae and larvae, E. triacantha, and Thysanoessa macrura) in relation to environmental conditions each year. In addition to general patterns among taxa, we focused on how contrasting conditions during an ENSO-neutral year (2014) and an ENSO-positive year (2016) affected the type, quality, and distribution of food resources each year, as well as the body condition of each species. We observed high chlorophyll-a, low salinity, and shallow upper mixed-layer depths in 2014, and low chlorophyll-a, high salinity, and deep upper mixed-layer depths in 2016. Carbon sources varied among years, with most species enriched in delta C-13 when ENSO conditions were dominant. Trophic position and body condition also varied among years, with different responses among species depending on conditions; inter-annual variation in delta N-15 was minimal, while E. triacantha was the only species with notably lower body condition in 2016. We conclude that ENSO conditions around the northern Antarctic Peninsula may result in a more favorable feeding environment for all euphausiid species except E. triacantha, which may be the most negatively impacted by the predicted increase in ENSO conditions.

AB  - Conserving biodiversity with a growing human population is a key sustainability challenge. Consequently, a vast number of development initiatives across the globe have been designed to combine social, economic, and environmental perspectives. For the most part, the development community is well acquainted with the negative experiences and unintended consequences that some projects have or may bring. However, in tropical coastal ecosystems, this aspect is not completely acknowledged, studied, or understood. Here, we use tropical seagrass meadows as a model social-ecological system to investigate how sustainable development initiatives result in unintended consequences with both positive and negative outcomes for environment and society. We analyze the initiatives and their effects in terms of a typology encompassing ???flow???, ???addition???, and ???deletion??? effects and investigate them across four types of sustainable development initiatives that occur within tropical coastal environments: (1) megafauna conservation, (2) alternative livelihood programs, (3) mosquito net malaria prophylaxis, and (4) marine protected areas. Using these four initiatives as examples, we show that sustainable development initiatives can produce unintended effects with major consequences. Further, we illustrate how not assessing such effects may ultimately undermine the initial goals of the sustainable development intervention. Our study suggests that acknowledging unintended effects and transitioning them so that they become sustainable is more effective than ignoring effects or viewing them as trade-offs. We strongly stress the need for an a priori process in which positive effects, negative effects, and potential uncertainties and surprises are considered when planning the development intervention, and we argue for greater social-ecological monitoring of initiatives. As such, this contribution links to contemporary approaches dealing with the sustainability of natural resources and social-ecological systems and bridges with the importance of development initiatives in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Detecting microevolutionary responses to natural selection by observing temporal changes in individual breeding values is challenging. The collection of suitable datasets can take many years and disentangling the contributions of the environment and genetics to phenotypic change is not trivial. Furthermore, pedigree-based methods of obtaining individual breeding values have known biases. Here, we apply a genomic prediction approach to estimate breeding values of adult weight in a 35-year dataset of Soay sheep (Ovis aries). Comparisons are made with a traditional pedigree-based approach. During the study period, adult body weight decreased, but the underlying genetic component of body weight increased, at a rate that is unlikely to be attributable to genetic drift. Thus cryptic microevolution of greater adult body weight has probably occurred. Genomic and pedigree-based approaches gave largely consistent results. Thus, using genomic prediction to study microevolution in wild populations can remove the requirement for pedigree data, potentially opening up new study systems for similar research.

AB  - The faunal remains from the late Neolithic site of Ness of Brodgar on the Orkney Islands (UK) provide a unique opportunity to investigate past adaptations of animal husbandry strategies to the Northern island environment, as well as the potential management of red deer. In this study, sheep and red deer mandibles and loose teeth (dP(4) & M-3) from the Ness of Brodgar were studied to construct age-at-death profiles, and analysed for delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta O-18. The mortality profile showed that around half of the analysed sheep were slaughtered when they reached maturity (i.e. after 2-4 years of life), consistent with a husbandry regime targeted at meat production. The stable isotope evidence indicates seaweed consumption in winter by several sheep (domesticates), but not by red deer (wild, possibly managed fauna). This dietary difference may have resulted from anthropogenically mediated influences, e.g. restriction of red deer habitats to upland areas. The varying extent of seaweed consumption between individual sheep and between Neolithic Orkney sites suggests differences in sheep husbandry practices across Orkney, indicating that the adaptation to consume seaweed was not ubiquitous on Orkney in the Neolithic, and did not follow a linear development.

AB  - Replanting broadleaved trees in monoculture conifer plantations has been shown to improve the ecological environment. However, not much is known about the distribution properties of soil phosphate-mobilizing bacteria (PMB) under different mixed plantings or how PMB affects biometabolism-driven phosphorus (P) bioavailability. The phoD and pqqC genes serve as molecular markers of PMB because they regulate the mobilization of organic (Po) and inorganic (Pi) P. Differences in soil bioavailable P concentration, phoD- and pqqCharboring PMB communities, and their main regulators were analyzed using biologically-based P (BBP) and highthroughput sequencing approaches after combining coniferous trees (Pinus massoniana) and five individual broadleaved trees (Bretschneidera sinensis, Michelia maudiae, Cercidiphyllum japonicum, Manglietia conifera, and Camellia oleifera). The findings revealed that the contents of litter P, soil organic carbon (SOC), available Pi (CaCl2-P), and labile Po (Enzyme-P) were significantly higher in conifer-broadleaf mixed plantations than those in the monospecific Pinus massoniana plantations (PM), especially in the mixed stands with the introduction of Cercidiphyllum japonicum, Michelia maudiae, and Camellia oleifera. Conifer-broadleaf mixing had little effect on the abundance of phoD and pqqC genes but significantly altered species composition within the communities. Conifer-broadleaf mixing improved soil microbial habitat mainly by increasing the pH, increasing carbon source availability and nutrient content, decreasing exchangeable Fe3+ and Al3+ content, and decreasing the activation degrees of Fe and Al oxides in acidic soils. A small group of taxa (phoD: Bradyrhizobium, Tardiphaga, Nitratireductor, Mesorhizobium, Herbaspirillum, and Ralstonia; pqqC: Burkholderia, Variovorax, Bradyrhizobium, and Leptothrix) played a key role in the synthesis of P-related enzymes (e.g., alkaline phosphomonoesterase, ALP) and in lowering the levels of mineral-occluded (HCl-P) and chelated (Citrate-P) Pi. Overall, our findings highlight that mixing conifers and broadleaves could change the PMB communities that produce ALP and dissolve Pi to make P more bioavailable.

AB  - Egg predation by invasive and native species may have severe impacts on endangered species and negatively affect species recovery. We assessed the levels of egg predation within green turtle (Chelonia mydas) clutches on the island of Diego Garcia (7.42 degrees S, 72.45 degrees E), Chagos Archipelago (Indian Ocean). Native coconut crabs (Birgus latro) and ghost crabs (Ocypode spp.), as well as introduced black rats (Rattus rattus), were predators of eggs, with these species entering nests via tunnels dug obliquely in the sand. Often whole eggs were removed from clutches. For example, the mean clutch size at oviposition (mean 127.8 eggs, n = 23, range = 74-176) was significantly larger than at the end of incubation (mean 110.9 hatched and unhatched eggs, n = 16, range = 9-147). In other cases, egg predation was recorded where the egg had been opened and contents were eaten in the nest. Overall, hatching success (the percentage of eggs laid leading to a hatchling emerging from the egg) was 64.9%, while 3.1% of eggs were predated within nests, 18.1% died during incubation without predation and 13.9% were removed. We reviewed evidence from 34 sites around the world identifying 36 predators that were either native (e.g., crabs, and goannas, n = 30) or invasive (e.g., rats, and pigs, n = 8). Depending on location, a predator could be identified as both native and invasive (e.g., dogs). We discuss how either nest protection and/or invasive predator eradication may be used to increase egg survival and when these approaches might be used.

AB  - Insurance populations can provide a short-term safeguard for at-risk species. The goal for all insurance populations should be to maintain a high welfare, genetically diverse, self-sustaining population that is available for eventual reintroduction of animals back into the wild when it is safe to do so. However, many insurance populations in zoos are not meeting sustainability goals, and there is a need for larger conservation centers and sanctuaries, a greater focus on threatened species, and metapopulation management between independently managed pop-ulations. Within North America, privately-owned ranches frequently maintain large populations of threatened ungulates that are presently managed independently from AZA-accredited zoos. Using a large set of single nucleotide polymorphisms, we generated empirical kinship and genetic distance estimates for AZA and private ranch populations of southern sable antelope (Hippotragus niger niger) and critically endangered addra gazelle (Nanger dama ruficollis). We used stochastic population models to project population mean kinship (mk) and founder genome equivalents (FGE) over time with and without genetic metapopulation management, using empirical kinships and genetic distances to guide transfers. Mean kinship-guided transfers were consistently bene-ficial for all study populations, for both species. Genetic distance-guided transfers, however, resulted in modest population mk increases for AZA populations, but predicted remarkable de-creases in population mk for ranch populations. Although predicted benefits varied depending on management approach, our results show that a metapopulation management plan, whether mutually beneficial or altruistic, best supports species conservation by mitigating the loss of genetic diversity, minimizing the possibility of inbreeding, and yielding genetically diverse animals.

AB  - Co-production of conservation projects is favored by incorporating local ecological knowledge into project design and implementation. Using a mixed method approach, we asked how the territorial practices and knowledge of cowboys and livestock farmers inform their attitudes to this proposed project. We predicted that cowboy territorial practices would be reduced in diversity compared to the past, and that this may be associated with a reduction in coping or adaptation capacity in the face of environmental challenges. We further predicted that due to growing environmental and social pressures reducing traditional livelihood opportunities for this group, they are likely to see the guanaco reintroduction project in a conflictual and negative light. We additionally predicted that they would perceive local carnivorous species in a conflictual and negative way. We found that territorial practices among the sample had indeed decreased in diversity. The sample coped with changing socio-ecological conditions by taking up other jobs. However, we also found that they had majority favorable views on the guanaco reintroduction project. Yet their knowledge of current guanaco behavior led them to believe that the project would fail. However, they also observed that pumas and condors changed their behaviors. We suggest that there are opportunities to co-produce knowledge about the possibility of flexible and adaptive guanaco behavior, which may lead to restoration and create more sustainable future scenarios, by engaging with the territorial practices and local ecological knowledge of cowboys and livestock farmers.

AB  - Saharan ungulates have suffered from poaching across their range leading to population declines. Low abundance and habitat inaccessibility have limited the availability of empirical data on desert ungulate ecology in the wild. Our objective was to evaluate temporal and spatial distribution, and home-range sizes of wild dorcas gazelles (Gazella dorcas) and slender-horned gazelles (Gazella leptoceros) under natural conditions using observations from 14,398 camera-days collected between April 2019 and October 2021 in the 7,700-ha fenced area of Jbil National Park (Jbil NP), Tunisia. We individually identified gazelles in Jbil NP using unique horn morphology. Both gazelle species exhibited nocturnal activity patterns in summer, but diurnal activity patterns dominated in winter. We also detected both species more frequently in the plains than in mountains. Water presence was influential in determining distribution only for dorcas gazelles. Minimum convex polygons (MCPs) were 2,062 ha for both the male and female of the most frequently detected dorcas gazelle pair and 1,527 ha for another solitary male. For slender-horned gazelles, MCPs were 2,280 ha and 2,041 ha, respectively, for a male and a female detected in Jbil NP. The decline and rarity of gazelles in the Sahara Desert have limited the sample size of our observed populations. Our study provides hitherto unknown data on wild populations of rapidly declining gazelle species and contributes to ongoing conservation efforts.

AB  - Spatial distribution and habitat preferences of wisents (European bison) Bison bonasus (Linnaeus 1758), were studied in Bialowieska Primeval Forest (north-eastern Poland) composed of 94% broadleaved and mixed tree stands, on the basis of telemetric data obtained from 11 individuals (4 males and 7 females). Data was collected between 2012-2015 within the area of over 98 thou- sand ha. A majority of records for both sexes' presence was from the forested area, regardless of the season, compared to open areas (forest meadows, openings and agriculture neighbouring the forest). Outside of the forest in vegetative seasons, 36% of presence records of males and 26% of females were registered, and respectively about 39% and 41% in winter. This confirms the importance of an access to open areas for this species. Considering the availability of both types of habitats within home ranges occupied by wisents, the non-forest category was generally pre- ferred over the forest; however, those differences were the highest regarding the data on MCP area (the value of Ivlev's index 0.64), but were the lowest for the area representing concentrated use (kernel 50%) of a habitat. Regarding forest habitats, wisents selected against broadleaved stands but selected towards riparian vegetation. Although this species is not territorial, the degree of overlap between home ranges of particular mixed groups (consisting of cows, youngsters and calves) was very low. Data obtained in this study reveals patterns of the spatial structure of this wisent population, the oldest in the world, and therefore truly well established in its environ- ment, free ranging population of this species. Hence, the data for this population on trends in habitat selection may be a credible basis for the evaluation of habitat suitability of sites either already inhabited by this species or being considered for its future reintroductions and be useful in further management of its free ranging populations.

AB  - Herbivorous reef fishes provide a vital function in reef ecosystems by removing algae and making space available to coral recruits. The high abundance of herbivores in the reefs of the Lakshadweep islands has potentially aided in reef recovery and helped avoid a phase shift to an algal-dominated system, despite most areas having suffered massive coral losses. Mixed-species grouping in herbivores could potentially benefit both the participant species and the reef ecosystem by improving foraging efficiency. We examined the grouping propensity and species richness for three types of herbivore groups after a mass-bleaching event in 2010 and a mass recruitment event in 2015. The species richness and number of parrotfish groups, as well as the grouping propensity of common species, declined starkly across years, indicating that these groups may have formed in response to the mass-bleaching event, slowly diminishing as the reefs recovered. Conversely, large surgeonfish, which varied in richness and propensity across islands and aspect, are probably influenced by local processes. Small surgeonfish only increased in species richness and number in 2015, which may have been in response to the recruitment event. Thus, herbivorous fishes may respond differently to local ecosystem perturbations and play different roles in reef recovery. This article is part of the theme issue 'Mixed-species groups and aggregations: shaping ecological and behavioural patterns and processes'.

AB  - Efforts to develop American chestnuts [Castanea dentata, (Marsh.) Borkh], with improved resistance to the chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica (Murr.) Barr, and Phytophthora root rot, caused by Phythophthora cinnamomi Rands, are ongoing. Establishing founder populations of improved chestnut will require under-standing the ecological and silvicultural requirements of the species. In areas where white tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) hinder tree regeneration success, understanding how browsing will affect the estab-lishment of planted chestnut is critical. We evaluated the impact of browsing by deer on survival, growth and competitive status of hybrid chestnuts planted in 15 northern hardwood sites in Pennsylvania. We found that after six years, chestnuts planted in fences were 65 percent taller and 35 larger in basal diameter than chestnuts in unfenced areas. Browsing by deer shifted the competitive dynamics faced by the chestnuts by favoring slower growing, browse tolerant species and reducing the heights of competing woody stems. Nevertheless, the competitive status of chestnuts in unfenced plots remained stagnant over time due to repeated browsing, while it increased in fenced plots over time. Our results suggest that fencing or other means of reducing herbivory will be necessary to protect planted chestnuts in areas with moderate or high deer densities.

AB  - Cuvier's gazelle (Gazella cuvieri) was reintroduced in Tergou reserve (TR) in 2018-2019 to help restore its population at the Moroccan Central Plateau. A study on browsing trees and shrubs was conducted in this reserve to identify (i) the seasonal pattern of this activity and (ii) the most solicited tree and shrub species. Here, we used six random 500-m transects to collect, each month and at each transect, the number of fresh browsing traces of each encountered tree and shrub species. We used principal component analysis (PCA) and linear regression model (LM) to test seasonal variation of the composition of trees and shrubs browsed. Our results showed that, in this reserve, Olea europaea, Quercus ilex, Cistus salviifolius, and Cistus creticus are mostly browsed during winter, whereas Tetraclinis articulata and Ruta angustifolia are mainly used during spring. This information is useful to the managers of the TR not only to consider the importance of the aforementioned trees and shrubs for reintroduced gazelles but also to take the necessary measures so that the forest stand of this reserve is maintained at an appropriate level. Thus, the pursuit of monitoring is necessary to understand the bio-ecology of this semi-captive population more deeply. For this reason, the TR remains a useful and appropriate reference framework offering the opportunity for consolidating and improving the knowledge on this vulnerable mammal species in the view of a future successful release in the wild.

AB  - Addressing the challenge of predicting biodiversity requires models that fully capture the complex dynamics of species and communities. While species distribution models (SDMs) predict individual species' distributions based on environmental variables, they often fail to reconstruct realistic communities. Macroecological models (MEMs), on the other hand, predict community indices but lack species-level resolution. To bridge this gap, we introduce CAMELIA (Community Assemblage Modelling macroEcoLogically Informed with AI), a neural network framework integrating species distribution data with community constraints to improve biodiversity predictions. Approach and Methods. CAMELIA uses a multitask neural network to jointly optimize species occurrence probabilities and community indices. It recalibrates species probabilities from stacked SDMs using observed or predicted community indices. We tested CAMELIA on plant communities in the French Alps, using MEM predictions (CAMELIA-MEM), high-quality field data (CAMELIA-OBS) and degraded field data (CAMELIA-PROXY) for various community indices: species richness, community mean and community standard deviation for plant height, specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen content. CAMELIA substantially improved community predictions over stacked SDMs. With observed indices, it reconstructed communities with functional indices highly correlated with observations (for community mean plant height: R2 = 0.98 vs. 0.74 with S-SDMs), reduced the mean errors in predicting species richness by 38%, and increased the S & oslash;rensen coefficient by an average of 33%. Even with lower-quality data, CAMELIA-MEM outperformed stacked SDMs in community standard deviation (R2 +6.9%) and species composition (+10.6% for S & oslash;rensen). With noisy community indices (CAMELIA-PROXY), CAMELIA remained robust, with R2 values for all indices falling between CAMELIA-MEM and CAMELIA-OBS, often closer to the latter (e.g. R2 for community mean plant height = 0.92), demonstrating resilience to imperfect data. CAMELIA provides a flexible and effective framework for improving community structure predictions. By optimizing species probabilities to align with community constraints, it produces more ecologically realistic assemblages than stacked SDMs. Its adaptability to different data qualities makes it a valuable tool for biodiversity modelling. Future developments should explore the integration of remotely sensed biodiversity indices to further enhance predictions, particularly for conservation applications.

AB  - Ecological niche models (ENMs) are crucial for identifying habitat distribution patterns, understanding habitat preferences, and formulating effective conservation policies. However, accurately quantifying the three-dimensional (3D) structure of habitats, a fundamental component, presents challenges. These estimations heavily depend on the quality of original samples (presence/absence), yet reliable absence data requires prolonged and repeated observations, limiting both efficiency and accuracy. In the study, we focused on the endangered Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti), listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. We developed an adaptive similarity-based model that introduced a "similarity" pseudo-absence sampling approach for ecological niche modeling using fine-scale (20 m) 3D environmental variables from UAV LiDAR data. This approach integrated geographic similarity with an adaptive kernel density estimation (AKDE) method to prioritize pseudo-absence data sampling and then employed three typical machine learning models (SVM, BRT, and RF) for prediction, verifying the feasibility of this approach and offering direct insights into habitat distribution and preferences. The results indicated that the AKDE method provided the best fit in measuring similarity features. Through the model, the performance of estimations exhibited improved (AUC = 0.89-0.94, TSS = 0.71-0.82, and COR = 0.69-0.79), with average increases of 7 %, 14 %, and 12 %, respectively. The RF model produced more coherent suitable habitats, identifying regions at higher elevations (3100 m-3300 m) with preferences for low understory vegetation density (2-5 m, <10 %), moderate canopy relief ratio (> 0.35), lower tree height (10 m-25 m), and sunny slopes (0.60-1). Our findings demonstrate that integrating UAV LiDAR data with ecological niche modeling, along with the improved pseudo-absence sampling approach, enhances habitat assessment and offers significant potential for advancing conservation strategies.

AB  - The Falkland Islands marine environment host a mix of temperate and subantarctic species. This review synthesizes baseline information regarding ontogenetic migration patterns and trophic interactions in relation to oceanographic dynamics of the Falkland Shelf, which is useful to inform ecosystem modelling. Many species are strongly influenced by regional oceanographic dynamics that bring together different water masses, resulting in high primary production which supports high biomass in the rest of the food web. Further, many species, including those of commercial interest, show complex ontogenetic migrations that separate spawning, nursing, and feeding grounds spatially and temporally, producing food web connections across space and time. The oceanographic and biological dynamics may make the ecosystem vulnerable to climatic changes in temperature and shifts in the surrounding area. The Falkland marine ecosystem has been understudied and various functional groups, deep-sea habitats and inshore-offshore connections are poorly understood and should be priorities for further research.

AB  - Although birds have traditionally been considered anosmic, increasing evidence indicates that olfaction plays an important role in the foraging behaviours of insectivorous birds. Recent studies have shown that birds can exploit herbivore-induced plant volatiles and sexual pheromones of adult insects to locate their prey. Many insectivorous birds prey on immature insects, providing relevant ecosystem services as pest regulators in natural and agricultural ecosystems. We asked whether birds could rely on chemical cues emitted by the immature stages of insects to prey on them. To address this question, we performed field experiments to evaluate if insectivorous birds can detect the aggregation pheromone produced by the larvae of the carpenter worm, Chilecomadia valdiviana. Groups of five artificial larvae were placed in branches of 72 adult trees in a remnant fragment of a sclerophyllous forest in central Chile. Each grouping of larvae contained a rubber septum loaded with either larval pheromone as treatment or solvent alone as control. We found that the number of larvae damaged by bird pecks was significantly higher in groups with dispensers containing the larval extract than in control groups. Our results show that birds can rely on immature insect-derived chemical cues used for larvae aggregation to prey on them.

AB  - Available studies on the vegetation development in Patagonia cluster along the forest-steppe ecotone, whilst little information is available from within the mountains. This study investigates shifts in the eastern boundary of rainforest taxa during the Late Glacial and Holocene periods. Continuous sections of highly organic sediments with several interbedded tephra layers were obtained at El Laguito del Morro Lake (41 degrees 32' 24.4" S, 71 degrees 47' 50.0" W), which were analyzed for pollen and macro charcoal. Additional macrofossil analysis was conducted to support the interpretations of pollen data and gain reliable ma-terial for radiocarbon dating. Fluctuations in regional precipitation were inferred from changes in the adjacent peatbog. The pollen record documents five distinct periods of forest diversity and structure. Late Glacial and early Holocene vegetation were characterized by a combination of Podocarpus and Cupres-saceae pollen which has no modern analogue. Taxa in question became rare, and or gradually dis-appeared around 10,300 cal yr BP when Nothofagus dombeyi type pollen increases but fluctuates. With the overall decline of charcoal concentrations around 7500 cal. BP Nothofagus dombeyi-type pollen stabilizes and dominates the diagram. After the rise in charcoal concentrations around 4000 cal yr BP also the overall vegetation composition changes around 3600 cal yr BP, with the rise of Cupressaceae pollen attributed to Austrocedrus chilensis marking the establishment of the modern vegetation structure. The last stronger change in vegetation composition is characterized by the expansion of the shrub Discaria sp. 770 cal yr BP. Charcoal and pollen data show a clear link between changes in fire regime and vegetation composition, however, changes in climate were most likely the main driver for both. During the Late Glacial period, a rainforest developed under cool temperatures and high moisture. Severity of fires decreased during a cold reversal period from ca. 12,800 to 11,300 cal yr BP. During Early Holocene, increased seasonality, volcanism-derived disturbances, and low-frequency surficial fires, enhanced Nothofagus dombeyi forest establishment. The expansion of the mixed Nothofagus dombeyi- Austrocedrus chilensis forest occurred under increased precipitation variability and the increase of low severity fires related to the establishment of El Ni ($$) over tilde no Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode during the Late Holocene. Scrub expansion occurred during historical times because of induced fires. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are a highly destructive invasive species throughout North and South America, Australia, and many island nations. Where invasive, their populations are targeted for control to reduce damage. Con-trolling wild pigs often involves baiting to draw them into traps or entice them to consume a toxic bait. However, baiting can have mixed success in congregating wild pigs to focal areas long enough for control measures to ultimately be implemented. We sought to evaluate how environmental conditions (i.e., precipitation) and negative stimuli (i.e., proxy for exposure to previous control efforts) influenced use of bait sites by wild pigs. We compared visitation to bait sites during dry (2019-2020) and wet (2021) years, and between wild pigs that had been previously trapped and released in southcentral Alabama and northcentral Texas, USA. We found that drier years substantially increased use of bait sites by wild pigs (i.e., 119-136 % increase over 17 days). Similarly, wild pigs that did not experience negative stimuli had increased use of bait sites (i.e., 30-31 % increase over 17 days). We recommend that managers intensify their control efforts during drier periods to take advantage of susceptible behaviors of wild pigs during these times. We also recommend that control efforts focus on eliminating the potential for surviving wild pigs which may experience negative stimuli (e.g., narrow misses during trapping, shooting some wild pigs from a group, sub-lethal doses from toxic baits) and become educated against future efforts.

AB  - BackgroundSetting large- and medium-sized wild mammal (>= 2 kg) restoration goals is important due to their role as ecosystem engineers and generalized numeric reductions. However, determining wild mammal restoration goals is very challenging due to difficulties in obtaining data on current mammal density and due to unclear information on what mammal density values should be used as a reference. Here we chose a 154 ha conservation area within one of the last remnants of the mountainous Chaco from central Argentina. We suspected that extensive and unreported defaunation had occurred due to past human pressure and the introduction of non-native mammals. To conduct the analyses, we used a simplified technique that integrates methods used in rangeland and ecological sciences.ResultsEight native mammal species including only one herbivore species, and four non-native mammal species including three herbivore species were detected during 6113 camera trap days. We used known cattle densities as estimated by droppings and direct counts, together with the relative abundance indexes obtained from camera trap photos to calculate the densities of the other species, correcting for mammal size. Densities for the least and most abundant native species were 0.2 and 1.33 individuals km(-2), respectively; and for non-native species, 0.03 and 5.00 individuals km(-2), respectively. Native and non-native species represented 0.8% and 99.2%, respectively, of the biomass estimates. Reference values for native herbivore biomass, as estimated from net primary productivity, were 68 times higher than values estimated for the study area (3179 vs. 46.5 kg km(-2)).ConclusionsThere is an urgent need to increase native mammals, with special emphasis on herbivore biomass and richness, while non-native mammal numbers must be reduced. As cattle are widespread in large portions of the globe and there is a lot of experience estimating their abundances, the ratio method we used extrapolating from cattle to other large- and medium-sized mammals could facilitate estimating mammal restoration goals in other small and defaunated areas, where traditional methods are not feasible when target mammal densities get very low.

AB  - Purpose Intensive livestock grazing has been associated with an increased risk of soil erosion and concomitant negative impacts on the ecological status of watercourses. Whilst various mitigation options are promoted for reducing livestock impacts, there is a paucity of data on the relationship between stocking rates and quantified sediment losses. This evidence gap means there is uncertainty regarding the cost-benefit of policy preferred best management. Methods Sediment yields from 15 hydrologically isolated field scale catchments on a heavily instrumented ruminant livestock farm in the south west UK were investigated over similar to 26 months spread across 6 years. Sediment yields were compared to cattle and sheep stocking rates on long-term, winter (November-April), and monthly timescales. The impacts of livestock on soil vegetation cover and bulk density were also examined. Cattle were tracked using GPS collars to determine how grazing related to soil damage. Results No observable impact of livestock stocking rates of 0.15-1.00 UK livestock units (LU) ha(-1) for sheep, and 0-0.77 LU ha(-1) for cattle on sediment yields was observed at any of the three timescales. Cattle preferentially spent time close to specific fences where soils were visually damaged. However, there was no indication that livestock have a significant effect on soil bulk density on a field scale. Livestock were housed indoors during winters when most rainfall occurs, and best management practices were used which when combined with low erodibility clayey soils likely limited sediment losses. Conclusion A combination of clayey soils and soil trampling in only a small proportion of the field areas lead to little impact from grazing livestock. Within similar landscapes with best practice livestock grazing management, additional targeted measures to reduce erosion are unlikely to yield a significant cost-benefit.

AB  - Understanding consumer trophic status and long-term dietary changes can yield information about impacts of altered habitats on their ecology. In Hawai'i, coastal ecosystems have been significantly modified by the introduction of invasive seaweeds and mangroves, high nutrient load and overfishing, but so far, much is still to be understood about how these changes have affected the green turtle (Chelonia mydas). This study analyzed stable carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur isotope ratios in the bone tissue of modern and museum specimens of green turtles collected from 1901 to 2020 in Oahu and the North-western Hawaiian Islands to understand how their isotopic niche has changed through time, a crucial step towards restoring the ecological role of a formerly decimated species. The standard ellipse size and the total area of the convex hull of the isotopic niche of green turtles in three periods (1901-1951, 1992-2008, and 2018-2020) were calculated. The stable isotope values of ancient green turtles (1901-1951) suggest that they relied heavily on macroalgae even before the introduction of exotic species and eutrophication promoted the development of algal pastures. However, a few ancient green turtles relied heavily on seagrasses, and others complemented their macroalgae-based diets with significant amounts of animal matter. Such diet specialists were missing from the sample of current green sea turtles, suggesting that these foraging strategies are less common or perhaps even absent in the current population. The results suggest that green turtles have converged on the use of the most abundant resource, red macroalgae, likely because of the homogenization and simplification of coastal habitats and food webs due to anthropogenic influences. Restoring the population size of herbivorous fishes and a more diverse ecosystem structure may be necessary to recover the array of trophic strategies formerly present in the Hawaiian green turtle population.

AB  - 1. Rhodoliths, formed by free-living coralline algae, are distributed worldwide, and the rhodolith beds (RBs) that they form are recognized as structurally complex habitats. In the Mediterranean, they are generally distributed in the mesophotic zone, at depths of 30-100 m; so far, only a few shallow RBs (<2 m) have been reported (e.g. & Icirc;les Kuriat, Tunisia, and Stagnone Marsala, Italy).2. Here a shallow-water RB located in the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (south-eastern Italy, Mediterranean Sea) is described. The diversity of associated invertebrates, the rhodolith-forming algal species, the type of sediments, and the bed extent are characterized.3. The RB investigated extends over 5 ha at depths of 0.5-1.5 m. The rhodoliths vary in shape and size, from pralines to large spherical structures, and are formed by a single species, Neogoniolithon brassica-florida, growing around nuclei of both natural and anthropogenic origin. The associated fauna consisted of 158 taxa, 79 (50%) of which were new basin records. The associated diversity was approximately twice that of the underlying and nearby sediments.4. The structural complexity of the RBs promotes biodiversity and provides shelter, food, and a breeding ground for numerous species, including seahorses, which are a conservation priority in this basin.

AB  - Globalization has led to the frequent movement of species out of their native habitat. Some of these species become highly invasive and capable of profoundly altering invaded ecosystems. Feral swine (Sus scrofa x domesticus) are recognized as being among the most destructive invasive species, with populations established on all continents except Antarctica. Within the United States (US), feral swine are responsible for extensive crop damage, the destruction of native ecosystems, and the spread of disease. Purposeful human-mediated movement of feral swine has contributed to their rapid range expansion over the past 30 years. Patterns of deliberate introduction of feral swine have not been well described as populations may be established or augmented through small, undocumented releases. By leveraging an extensive genomic database of 18,789 samples genotyped at 35,141 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we used deep neural networks to identify translocated feral swine across the contiguous US. We classified 20% (3364/16,774) of sampled animals as having been translocated and described general patterns of translocation using measures of centrality in a network analysis. These findings unveil extensive movement of feral swine well beyond their dispersal capabilities, including individuals with predicted origins >1000 km away from their sampling locations. Our study provides insight into the patterns of human-mediated movement of feral swine across the US and from Canada to the northern areas of the US. Further, our study validates the use of neural networks for studying the spread of invasive species.

AB  - Many remote islands present barriers to effective wildlife monitoring in terms of challenging terrain and frequency of visits. The sub-Antarctic islands of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are home to globally significant populations of seabirds and marine mammals. South Georgia hosts the largest breeding populations of Antarctic fur seals, southern elephant seals and king penguins as well as significant populations of wandering, black-browed and grey-headed albatross. The island also holds important populations of macaroni and gentoo penguins. The South Sandwich Islands host the world's largest colony of chinstrap penguins in addition to major populations of Adelie and macaroni penguins. A marine protected area was created around these islands in 2012 but monitoring populations of marine predators remains a challenge, particularly as these species breed over large areas in remote and often inaccessible locations. During the 2019/20 austral summer, we trialled the use of an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV; drone) to monitor populations of seals, penguins and albatross and here we report our initial findings, including considerations about the advantages and limitations of the methodology. Three extensive southern elephant seal breeding sites were surveyed with complete counts made around the peak pupping date, two of these sites were last surveyed 24 years ago. A total of nine islands, historically recorded as breeding sites for wandering albatross, were surveyed with 144 fledglings and 48 adults identified from the aerial imagery. The UAV was effective at surveying populations of penguins that nest on flat, open terrain, such as Adelie and chinstrap penguin colonies at the South Sandwich Islands, and an extensive king penguin colony on South Georgia, but proved ineffective for monitoring macaroni penguins nesting in tussock habitat on South Georgia as individuals were obscured or hidden by vegetation. Overall, we show that UAV surveys can allow regular and accurate monitoring of these important wildlife populations.

AB  - Premise of research. Brahea edulis is an endangered palm endemic to the oceanic island of Guadalupe, Mexico, with a small population of just about 4000 individuals; it was chronically grazed by goats for about two centuries. The evolutionary specificities of insular biotas provide unique scenarios for studying the roles of geography, demography, and climate in driving population divergence. A comprehensive comparison between insular and mainland sister species contributes to a much better understanding of the species-specific responses to the ecological drivers of diversity, divergence, and speciation. Methodology. Here we used a comparative approach coupled with genomic (genotyping by sequencing; single-nucleotide polymorphisms) data to analyze samples from island and mainland Brahea palm species and elucidate their diversity, population divergence, and demographic history. Pivotal results. Genetic diversity analyses revealed higher diversity in insular palms compared with their mainland sister species. Genetic relationships among palm individuals on Guadalupe Island resulted in two strongly diverged clusters that reflected their geographic distributions. Divergence among B. edulis populations was mostly driven by the joint effect of low migration and the climatic heterogeneity of the island's conditions. Using approximate Bayesian analysis, we further evaluated the demographic history of B. edulis. We found the genetic signatures of demographic fluctuations, inferring an effective population size (N-e) reduction that occurred in the late Quaternary and relatively low current N-e. Conclusions. These findings contribute to the ever-growing body of evidence that low genetic diversity in island populations cannot always be generalized. Besides, genetic diversity and differentiation on islands are more likely to be species specific and are strongly influenced by population size and historical factors such as the time since the population was established, ecological characteristics of the island, and anthropogenic impact. Our results also represent groundwork for future conservation and restoration programs for this endangered insular palm species.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation and host community composition are implicated as key drivers of changing tick populations and tick-borne pathogen dynamics, altering infection risk through coupled socioecological pathways that mediate interactions between tick vectors, vertebrate hosts, and humans. Patterns of host diversity may be particularly idiosyncratic across urbanized landscapes, due to trade-offs between extreme fragmentation that reduces habitat suitability and access, and human activities that artificially increase resource availability for wildlife. We used camera and hair trap surveys and tick sampling to identify links between landscape composition and configuration, the mammalian host community, and the presence of three tick vector species at a human-wildlife interface in New York City, an emerging area within an endemic region for several tick-borne diseases. We found that human infrastructures, such as the presence of fences in yards, could affect mammal host community composition by changing the "hardness" of edges between urban greenspaces and residential areas. We identified yard- and broader landscape-level features associated with the presence of urban mammal species, and identified cascading effects of host community composition on tick distribution in yards, suggesting management implications for the mitigation of human exposure to tick-borne pathogens. In particular, we identified a possible role of ubiquitous mesomammals, such as raccoons (Procyon lotor), in transporting Amblyomma americanum ticks between parks and neighboring residential yards, and confirmed the key role of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) for introducing Ixodes scapularis ticks into yards. Our results challenge assumptions that biodiversity loss in human-modified areas always increases the risk for tick-borne diseases. Instead, we found many residential sites had higher mammal species richness and higher detection of low reservoir competent ("dilution") hosts for Borrelia burgdorferi, such as opossums (Didelphis virginiana), than paired forested greenspaces. Our study highlights the importance of disentangling the mechanisms mediating tick-borne disease hazard as a critical first step toward reducing urban tick-borne disease risk.

AB  - Context Dama wallabies (Notamacropus eugenii) were introduced into the Bay of Plenty Region, New Zealand, in the early 1900s. They subsequently became an invasive pest, damaging pasture, silviculture, and native vegetation. One key management strategy is the eradication of isolated populations. Aims First, we empirically determined the detection probabilities of detection dogs and handlers searching for faecal pellet groups of dama wallaby in pasture and forested habitats. Second, we used detection probabilities to derive surveillance system sensitivity (SSe) and estimate the cost per hectare required to have a high confidence (95%) that a targeted wallaby population has been eradicated. Methods We collected and deployed faecal pellet groups in an area with no naturally occurring wallabies. Following faecal pellet surveys by detection dogs and handlers, we estimated the probability of a dog-handler team detecting a pellet group and derived SSe. We derived SSe for a single faecal pellet group and, using simulation, upscaled this estimate to multiple pellet groups voided by a single surviving individual. Key results The detection probability of dogs searching for a single faecal pellet group that was within the detection swathe was relatively high (minimum of 45%). Scaling this instantaneous probability of detection for a single pellet group to the multiple pellet groups voided by a single wallaby around its home range resulted in 30-33-fold increases in SSe compared to the sensitivity of searching for a single faecal pellet group. The costs of surveillance for confirming eradication using detection dogs and handlers are NZ$54-NZ$72 for a 100-ha area. Conclusions Detection dogs and handlers are an efficacious and cost-effective surveillance method for confirming eradication of dama wallaby in open and forested habitats. Implications Detection dogs and handlers are an important surveillance tool for the management of wallabies in New Zealand. The data from this study enable managers to determine the required surveillance effort to have high confidence (e.g. 0.95) that a wallaby population has been eradicated, or that a suspected new population is actually absent if no wallabies are detected. Additionally, it enables per hectare costs of surveillance to be estimated and compared to alternative methods.

AB  - Seagrass meadows serve as critical marine habitats, offering numerous benefits to both humans and wildlife. Taiping Island, situated in the South China Sea, has been historically known for its abundant seagrass meadows. However, satellite imagery suggested there was a low density of seagrasses around Taiping Island. On the other hand, many green turtles (Chelonia mydas) were observed from the shore. To investigate this phenomenon, we conducted drone surveys of the shallow reefs and discovered a density of 902 +/- 601 (mean +/- SD) individual turtles per square kilometer during high tides. In addition, we conducted a cage experiment to test the hypothesis that large herbivores are impacting seagrass abundance negatively. The results indicated that the blade lengths of seagrasses in cages were significantly longer than those outside. It is likely that large herbivores such as green sea turtles are the key consumers of seagrass on the shallow reef flats of Taiping Island. Accordingly, further research and management should take into account that the increasing number of sea turtles may deplete the seagrasses and have an impact on the seagrass ecosystems.

KW  - SEGMENTATION
AB  - Sheep are a primary species in animal husbandry. Accurate sheep population counts are vital for managing husbandry practices and preventing grassland overgrazing. Current methods using UAV images are time-consuming and costly. The small size of sheep and complex backgrounds in large-scale areas make accurate extraction challenging. We propose the Small Object Extraction Net (SOENet), a semantic segmentation model with an encoder-decoder structure. The SOENet encoder resizes the original images to three resolutions to extract multi-scale sheep features. A Multi-resolution Context Enhancement (MCE) module is proposed to extract complicated contextual features of sheep by concatenating different scales of feature maps to reduce the possibility of commission errors. To minimize omission errors, a Multi-resolution Feature Fusion (MFF) module is proposed by introducing more scales of features to the encoder, facilitating the sharing and exchange of multi-scale sheep features. Our model outperforms nine deep learning models, with a 7.9% improvement in precision and a 1.2% increase in mIoU. SOENet provides an effective solution for large-scale sheep extraction from various ground objects.

AB  - We present a compilation of published telemetric results, complemented by the addition of new results where necessary, to justify the expansion of the marine protected areas in the Eastern Pacific. In addition, we furnish evidence that fishing effort by commercial vessels, carrying position-monitoring, satellite-communicating radio beacons, has diminished within their boundaries. Researchers have described the movement ecology of nine species of sharks at these insular sites: the Galapagos archipelago off Ecuador, Malpelo Island off Colombia, Cocos Island off Costa Rica, and the Revillagigedo archipelago off Mexico. Mainly two telemetric techniques have been utilized: (1) placing coded ultrasonic beacons on individuals and detecting their presence with autonomous receivers deployed along the coasts of the islands and (2) outfitting individuals with SPOT and PSAT tags: the former enabling the ARGOS satellite to detect surface-swimming individuals, the latter releasing from individuals and rising to the surface to transmit geolocation based-positions to the same satellite. This information has enabled Mexico to create the Revillagigedo National Park, Colombia to increase the size of the Malpelo Fauna and Flora Sanctuary, and Costa Rica to create a protective corridor between Cocos and the Las Gemelas seamounts. Satellite tracking of sharks outside the current boundaries of the Galapagos Marine Reserve supports the need to increase its size in the future. Hence, telemetric studies have played and continue to serve an essential role in providing a well-supported rationale for research managers to match the size of their marine reserves to the spatial ecologies of the species within them.

FX  - We would like to express our appreciation to Galo Quezada and Washington Tapia, who provided the permit (Klimley PC-37-11) to conduct tagging studies in the Galapagos National Sanctuary. Eduardo Espinosa and Harry Reyes are thanked for overseeing for the Parque National Galapagos the research that was completed in the Galapagos archipelago. Many researchers helped in both the tagging and analysis of the resulting detection data, particularly Frida Lara-Lizardi, Robert Rubin, German Soler, George Shillinger, and Todd Steiner. Alex Antoniou of Fins Attached and Chris Fischer of OCEARCH provided ship time and funds for the purchase of acoustic and satellite tags as well as autonomous receivers. Scott Henderson of Conservation International was an early proponent of protecting sharks in the ETP. His input led to the first grant from 2001 to 2003 given by the Committee for Research and Exploration at the National Geographic Society, entitled "Tracking hammerhead sharks for creation of marine reserves" (principal investigator: senior author). That was followed by grants to the same investigator in 2007-2008, 2007-2008, 2009, and 2012. Additional funding for the tagging studies was provided by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation in 2004-2005, the Whitley Fund for Nature from 2005 to 2015, the World Wildlife Fund in 2007-2008, the International Community Foundation in 2009-2010, Conservation International in 2010-2011, and the Galapagos Conservancy in 2010-2011 and 2011-2012. This work was completed under the auspice of two Animal Care Protocols obtained by the senior author at the University of California, Davis: (1) 12140 - "Tracking hammerhead sharks for creation of marine reserves" and (2) 16022 - "Tracking sharks in the open ocean." The acoustic tag detections and satellite tracks presented in this article for (1) the Revillagigedos Islands are present in a database maintained by Pelagios Kakunja, (2) the detections at Cocos Island are in a database kept by Centro de Rescate de Especies Marinas Amenazadas (CREMA) and the Ocean Tracking Network (OTN), (3) files of acoustic detections and satellite tracks for Malpelo Island are present in a database maintained by Fundacion Malpelo y Otros Ecosistemas Marinos, and (4) the acoustic detections for the Galapagos archipelago are present in the database of OTN and satellite tracks for the Galapagos archipelago are under curatorship of ARH at the Universidad San Francisco de Quito.

AB  - The Neolithization process introduced remarkable ecological impacts, especially in Mediterranean mountain areas. We generated a comprehensive sedimentary ancient DNA record from the central Pyrenees, spanning 12,200 to 1300 years before present, revealing the earliest continuous presence of sheep (6500 years before present) and cattle (5900 years before present) in alpine southern Europe. This evidence suggests pastoralism nearly concurred with the Neolithic in the Iberian lowlands, challenging prior assumptions of only sporadic occurrence and confirming Neolithic pastoralist use of mountain ecosystems. A notable plant community shift arose at 6000 years before present, with deciduous forests transitioning into diverse open grasslands. This change became pronounced at 4200 years before present, aligning with continuous presence of domesticates and a regional cooling climate, suggesting a synergistic relationship between past climate change and human-induced plant community alteration. These findings highlight complex interactions between climate, human activities, and landscape dynamics during the Neolithic in Mediterranean mountains.

AB  - Host genetics affect their susceptibility to pathogens and their ability to transmit infections (contagiousness). Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a lethal prion disease of cervids with a wide distribution in North America, and with the first detection in Europe among reindeer in Norway in 2016. The PRNP gene, encoding the prion protein, has a strong impact on host susceptibility, and the duration and level of prion shedding. We developed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Dead (SEID) model to enhance our understanding of how PRNP genotype variation influences CWD dynamics. In a baseline model with only highly susceptible PRNP alleles, CWD prevalence reached a high level before the population collapsed. We sequentially introduced PRNP heterogeneity in susceptibility (Scenario 1), the duration of prion shedding (Scenario 2), and amount of prion shedding (Scenario 3). Heterogeneity in susceptibility alone (Scenario 1) led to a slow increase in CWD prevalence towards its peak, followed by a gradual decline and eventual epidemic die-out. Increasing the infection duration with constant shedding for the less susceptible PRNP genotypes (Scenario 2) led to a high and persistent CWD-prevalence level. When combining low-susceptibility PRNP alleles and increased duration of shedding but at lower levels (Scenario 3), the prevalence of CWD peaked slowly compared to the other scenarios. Hence, variation in PRNP allele composition can yield qualitatively different CWD epidemics among populations. Our ability to predict the longterm effects of CWD remains limited, primarily due to uncertainty about shedding patterns, environmental contamination, and other factors associated with PRNP-alleles that may limit selection.

AB  - 1. Ancient trees have important ecological, historical and social connections, and are a key source of dead and decaying wood, a globally declining resource. Wood-pastures, which combine livestock grazing, open spaces and scattered trees, are significant reservoirs of ancient trees, yet information about their true abundance within wood-pastures is limited. England has extensive databases of both ancient trees and wood-pasture habitat, providing a unique opportunity for the first large-scale, national case study to address this knowledge gap.
   2. We investigated the relationship between the abundance of ancient trees in a large sample of English wood-pastures (5,571) and various unique environmental, historical and anthropogenic predictors, to identify wood-pastures with high numbers of undiscovered ancient trees. A major challenge in many modelling studies is obtaining independent data for model verification: here we introduce a novel model verification step using series of historic maps with detailed records of trees to validate our model predictions. This desk-based method enables rapid verification of model predictions using completely independent data across a large geographical area, without the need for, or limitations associated with, extensive field surveys.
   3. Historic map verification estimates correlated well with model predictions of tree abundance. Model predictions suggest there are similar to 101,400 undiscovered ancient trees in all wood-pastures in England, around 10 times the total current number of ancient tree records. Important predictors of ancient tree abundance included wood-pasture area, distance to several features including cities, commons, historic Royal forests and Tudor deer parks, and different types of soil and land classes.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Historical maps and statistical models can be used in combination to produce accurate predictions of ancient tree abundance in wood-pastures, and inform future targeted surveys of wood-pasture habitat, with a focus on those deemed to have undiscovered ancient trees. This study provides support for improvements to conservation policy and protection measures for ancient trees and wood-pastures.

AB  - Acanthurus nigrofuscus (Acanthuridae), a common fish on the coral reefs of the Ryukyu Islands, southern Japan, is considered to be important for maintaining the health of coral reef ecosystems. However, the life history of the species in Japan is largely unknown. In this study, age, growth and maturation of A. nigrofuscus was determined from 395 specimens [44.7-174.5 mm fork length (FL)] collected between September 2020 and March 2022 on the Miyagi coast, located on the west coast of Okinawa-jima Island, central Ryukyu Islands. Mean gonadosomatic indices were high in September 2020 and from May to August 2021 for both sexes, with histological observations of the gonads revealing that individuals with developed oocytes (migratory nucleus and hydrated stages) occurred from May to September. Postovulatory follicles were observed in individuals collected in September 2020 and from May to August 2021. The length (age) at 50% maturity was 104.1 mm FL (1.0 yr) for females and 93.9 mm FL (0.5 yr) for males, the age range being 0-25 yr (n = 193) for females and 0-20 yr (n = 170) for males, with von Bertalanffy growth functions of Lt = 148.6 {1 - exp [-0.51 (t + 1.55)]} for females, Lt = 156.0 {1 - exp [-0.38 (t + 2.01)]} for males, and Lt = 151.8 {1 - exp [-0.40 (t + 2.11)]} for both sexes combined. Similar to other species of Acanthridae, A. nigrofuscus has a long-lived biphasic growth trajectory, with rapid initial growth and a long lifespan after reaching asymptotic size.

AB  - Introduction Pencil pine (Athrotaxis cupressoides) is an iconic, paleoendemic tree restricted to historic fire refugia in Tasmania's western mountains. Anthropogenic climate change is increasingly exposing these areas to wildfire. Given that pencil pines have little capacity to recover from fire, and show scarce natural recruitment across their core range, they will be lost from many areas without interventions to restore population viability to burnt stands.Methods We conducted a large-scale field study targeting pencil pine stands burnt in recent (2016) and historic (1960) fires. Using small (0.5 m2) experimental plots distributed across a range of topography and vegetation, we trialled three interventions: i) protecting groups of naturally germinated seedlings from herbivores in situ (35 plots); ii) introducing seeds via multiple sowing methods (300 plots); and iii) transplanting tube stock propagated from seed or cutting material, with and without herbivore protection (1007 plots).Results We found that protecting natural germinants from herbivores did not prevent seedling mortality over 2.5 years, and sowing interventions largely failed. Most transplants exposed to herbivores failed to establish after 1.5 years, but establishment rates were high with herbivore exclusion, indicating strong predation by native macropod herbivores. Transplant establishment also varied with fine-scale topography, with the best outcomes in well-drained and Sphagnum dominated positions, and the worst outcomes in poorly-drained positions, suggesting young pencil pines are sensitive to waterlogging. Transplant establishment rates varied little between recently and historically burnt sites, and were insensitive to how plants were propagated.Discussion In summary, transplanting tube stock with herbivore protection is a promising method for restoring burnt pencil pine stands, and establishment rates can be improved by selecting favourable planting positions at fine scales. Our findings suggest pencil pine stands burnt decades previously are suitable for restoration. Managers seeking to conserve pencil pines may begin restoring both historically and recently burnt stands, alongside protecting unburned stands from fire. Interventions should be refined through adaptive management, including re-surveys of this long-term trial.

AB  - Societal Impact StatementWith increasing demand for sustainable goods, botanical dyes are of increasing interest and value to consumers, industry and small-scale artisanal producers. Goldenrod is a widely used dye plant with a long history of traditional use. The impact of the well-studied goldenrod stem gall produced by Eurosta solidaginis on goldenrod botanical dyes-and the broader impact of insect herbivory on plant dyes-has not been explored. Our research provides an initial investigation into how dye strength and colour are affected by the complex gall-maker-host-plant relationship-an essential step in understanding the value insect herbivory may bring to botanical dye production, as well as potential limitations of this dye variation in larger scale production.Summary Goldenrod (Solidago spp.) plants produce botanical dyes with a long history of traditional use. The concentration and profile of phenolic compounds in goldenrod, influenced by biotic and abiotic factors, impact the properties of the resulting dyes. We investigated whether the presence of the stem-galling insect E. solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae) affected dye produced from goldenrod. Leaves collected from upper and lower stem sections of galled and non-galled goldenrod plants were processed to extract dye compounds into a soluble form. The dye was analysed through colourimetric comparison of dyed fabric swatches and spectrophotometry of aqueous extracts to evaluate phenolic content. Through colourimetric analysis using a paired t-test, we found that the colour difference between upper and lower leaves was significantly affected by whether the plant was galled (t[6] = -2.80, p = 0.02). Comparing dyes made from lower versus the upper leaves of the same plants showed a larger colourimetric difference in non-galled than galled plants. This indicates that the galling insect affected the availability of dye compounds. Spectrophotometric analysis showed that increases in total phenolics between lower and upper leaves of galled plants were not significantly greater than in non-galled plants (p = 0.103), indicating a possible response to insect herbivory. The differing effects of the gall on dye content and total phenolics illustrate the complexity of plant-herbivore interactions and provide insight into the influence of biotic factors on botanical dyes.

AB  - Elephants were once widely distributed across the Indonesian island of Sumatra but now exist in small, isolated populations. Using the best data available on elephant occurrence, we aimed to (a) predict potential habitat suitability for elephants (Elephas maximus sumatranus) across the island of Sumatra and (b) model landscape connectivity among the extant elephant populations. We used direct sightings and indirect observations of elephant signs, as well as six remotely sensed proxies of surface ruggedness, vegetation productivity and structure, and human land use and disturbance, to model habitat suitability in a Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment. We validated the habitat suitability prediction using 10-fold spatial block cross validation and by calculating the area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR), sensitivity, and specificity for each model iteration. We also used a geolocation dataset collected from global positioning system (GPS) collars fitted on elephants as an independent validation dataset. Models showed good predictive performance with a mean AUC-PR of 0.73, sensitivity of 0.76, and specificity of 0.68. Greater than 83% of the independent GPS collar geolocations were located in predicted suitable habitat. We found human modification, surface ruggedness, and normalized difference vegetation index to be the most important variables for predicting suitable elephant habitat. Thirty-two percent, or 135,646 km(2), of Sumatra's land area was predicted to be suitable habitat, with 43 patches of suitable habitat located across Sumatra. Areas with high connectivity were concentrated in the Riau and North Sumatra provinces. Though our analysis highlights the need to improve the quality of data collected on Sumatran elephants, more suitable habitat remains on Sumatra than is used by known populations. Targeted habitat conservation, especially of the suitable habitat in and around the Lamno, Balai Raja, Tesso Tenggara, Tesso Utara, Bukit Tigapuluh, Seblat, Padang Sugihan, and Bukit Barisan Selatan ranges, may improve the long-term viability of this critically endangered species.

AB  - For centuries, humans have intentionally moved species around the world, and such actions have rarely been laudable from conservation perspectives. The notion that introduced populations of cold-adapted species hold conservation value despite their non-native status remains controversial. Many such populations exist as a legacy of humans moving wildlife to novel environments with little true consideration of species conservation. Herein, we identify cases in which individuals from inadvertent climate refugia (ICR) are returned to formerly occupied ranges or used to augment declining native populations. While conservation benefits have been infrequently realized, the global distribution of ICR offers a potentially untapped resource. Lessening biodiversity loss under increasing climate challenges will likely require assisted migration of many species and necessitate novel valuation of extant introduced populations-such as those within ICR. While ecological costs of translocated species are widely known, we highlight how species moved generations ago to ICR offer a reservoir for reintroductions and a buffer against rapidly changing climates.

AB  - Objective: To measure the seasonal effect on endocrinological profiles and sex behavioural profiles during rainy and dry summer seasons in male Andaman local goat in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India.
   Methods: Ten adult male Andaman local goats were selected from the goat breeding farm, ICAR-Central Island Agricultural Research Institute, Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India. Endocrinological profiles such as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), cortisol and prolactin were analysed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Sex behavioural profiles such as libido score, mating ability score and sex behavioural score were measured during rainy and dry summer seasons in male Andaman local goat.
   Results: Endocrinological profiles as well as sex behavioural profiles differed significantly between rainy season and dry summer season (P<0.05). The levels of FSH, LH, testosterone, TSH, T3, and T4 were significantly higher in rainy season than in dry summer season whereas cortisol and prolactin were significantly higher in dry summer season than in rainy season (P<0.05). The ratio of T3:T4 was significantly higher in rainy season than in dry summer season. Similarly, libido score, mating ability score and sex behavioural score were significantly higher in rainy season than in dry summer season (P<0.05).
   Conclusions: Rainy season has significantly higher beneficial effects than summer season on reproduction and artificial breeding programmes in semi-intensive management of goat under the tropical humid island ecosystem in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

AB  - Accurate description of animal diets is central to ecology. Analyses based on DNA metabarcoding of faecal samples is used increasingly as a non-invasive and accurate method to determine animal diets. In this chapter, I introduce the brief history of molecular-based diet analyses and present the basic workflow of the metabarcoding diet analyses: sampling, DNA extraction, PCR amplification, sequencing, data processing and taxon identification of food DNA sequences, with several important notes to obtaining reliable data from degraded faecal DNA. The method's limitations and technical challenges, such as possible contamination and uncertainty of quantification etc., which require special consideration in research planning and data interpretation, are also discussed. This chapter will help users, especially new scientists, who are considering using the metabarcoding approach in their studies, understand the principles and processes of metabarcoding. I also hope this chapter will facilitate developments in this method and answer broader ecological questions related to trophic interactions.

AB  - Aim: How communities of organisms come together has long fascinated scientists, with renewed interest in using functional and evolutionary patterns to infer mechanisms of community assembly. Ecological theory predicts that biotic interactions could lead to either divergence in the event of niche partitioning or convergence through the exclusion of competitively inferior species, but most macroecological studies attribute the latter to environmental influences. Here, we investigated the relative importance of these two opposing mechanisms across broad spatial gradients. We hypothesised stronger signals of: (i) convergence at high latitude owing to ecological generalism and (ii) divergence at low latitudes owing to specialisation.<br /> Major Taxa Studied: Reef-associated bony fishes.<br /> Location: Global.Time Period2006-2019.<br /> Methods: We used a global dataset on marine reef fish assemblages comprising 2476 species at 3325 sites to disentangle the biotic drivers of community assembly across > 100 degrees of latitude. We then applied a framework to remove environmental influences before examining whether any signs of biotic interactions remained in the trait and phylogenetic diversity of local communities relative to the (environmentally constrained) regional species pool, drawing on six functional traits and a phylogeny of bony fishes.<br /> Results: Local fish assemblages were more functionally and phylogenetically similar to each other than expected based on the regional species pool at higher latitude reefs (i.e., show greater convergence). This pattern was evident after accounting for major sources of local environmental variation, suggesting exclusion of weak competitors. Functional convergence was mainly driven by traits related to resource acquisition, with high-latitude assemblages converging towards more energetic carnivorous and planktivorous diets.<br /> Main Conclusions: Our results suggest that biotic interactions drive greater trait and phylogenetic convergence from tropical to temperate zones. Likely mechanisms include increasing generalism and overlap in ecological strategies towards the poles, leading to the exclusion of weak competitors.

AB  - Societal Impact Statement With increasing demand for sustainable goods, botanical dyes are of increasing interest and value to consumers, industry and small-scale artisanal producers. Goldenrod is a widely used dye plant with a long history of traditional use. The impact of the well-studied goldenrod stem gall produced by Eurosta solidaginis on goldenrod botanical dyes-and the broader impact of insect herbivory on plant dyes-has not been explored. Our research provides an initial investigation into how dye strength and colour are affected by the complex gall-maker-host-plant relationship-an essential step in understanding the value insect herbivory may bring to botanical dye production, as well as potential limitations of this dye variation in larger scale production.Summary Goldenrod (Solidago spp.) plants produce botanical dyes with a long history of traditional use. The concentration and profile of phenolic compounds in goldenrod, influenced by biotic and abiotic factors, impact the properties of the resulting dyes. We investigated whether the presence of the stem-galling insect E. solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae) affected dye produced from goldenrod. Leaves collected from upper and lower stem sections of galled and non-galled goldenrod plants were processed to extract dye compounds into a soluble form. The dye was analysed through colourimetric comparison of dyed fabric swatches and spectrophotometry of aqueous extracts to evaluate phenolic content. Through colourimetric analysis using a paired t-test, we found that the colour difference between upper and lower leaves was significantly affected by whether the plant was galled (t[6] = -2.80, p = 0.02). Comparing dyes made from lower versus the upper leaves of the same plants showed a larger colourimetric difference in non-galled than galled plants. This indicates that the galling insect affected the availability of dye compounds. Spectrophotometric analysis showed that increases in total phenolics between lower and upper leaves of galled plants were not significantly greater than in non-galled plants (p = 0.103), indicating a possible response to insect herbivory. The differing effects of the gall on dye content and total phenolics illustrate the complexity of plant-herbivore interactions and provide insight into the influence of biotic factors on botanical dyes.

AB  - Despite decades of habitat-based interventions, the red panda (Ailurus fulgens) remains in steep decline across its Himalayan range. Conservation strategies have emphasized forest cover and connectivity yet overlooked a key physiological constraint: the availability of dietary nitrogen. As obligatory bamboo folivores, red pandas depend on leaves with sufficiently high foliar nitrogen to meet metabolic and reproductive demands, though direct experimental evidence is limited. However, bamboo nitrogen content varies dramatically across species, seasons, elevations, and disturbance gradients. This perspective argues that the absence of nitrogen criteria constitutes a critical blind spot in red panda conservation. Sub-threshold habitats can function as ecological traps, silently undermining translocation, reproduction, and survival even in structurally intact forests. We call for a paradigm shift that integrates foliar nitrogen thresholds into conservation science, landscape planning, and reintroduction protocols. We outline research priorities to (1) establish red panda nitrogen requirements through controlled trials, (2) map nitrogen landscapes using NIRS and remote sensing, and (3) embed nutritional adequacy in habitat policy frameworks. Without this integration, conservation efforts risk being structurally sound but nutritionally void.

AB  - Context. Rusa deer (Cervus timorensis), originally introduced in the 1860s, are still spreading in eastern Australia. The expanding peri-urban rusa deer population in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia is having undesirable impacts on human and ecological communities, but the spatial structure of this population has not been investigated. Genetic information on invasive species is potentially useful in identifying management units to mitigate undesirable impacts. Aims. The aim of this study was to investigate population structure, characterise dispersal, and determine if natural and human-made landscape features affected gene flow in rusa deer invading the Illawarra region of New South Wales. Methods. We used reduced representation sequencing (DArT-Seq) to analyse single nucleotide polymorphisms distributed throughout the genomic DNA of rusa deer culled during a management program. We used admixture and Principal Component Analyses to investigate population structure with respect to natural and human-made landscape features, and we investigated whether our genetic data supported the presence of sex-biased dispersal. Key results. Genetic diversity was highest in the north, near the original introduction site. A railway line demarcated restricted gene flow. Surprisingly, the Illawarra escarpment, a prominent landscape feature, did not restrict gene flow. There was no evidence of sex-biased dispersal and seven individuals were identified as genetic outliers. Conclusions. The genetic structure of the Illawarra rusa deer population is consistent with individuals spreading south from their introduction site in Royal National Park. The population is not panmictic, and a landscape feature associated with urbanisation was associated with increased spatial genetic structure. Outliers could indicate hybridisation or secondary incursion events. Implications. Rusa deer can be expected to continue invading southwards in the Illawarra region, but landscape features associated with urbanisation might reduce dispersal across the landscape. The genetic structuring of the population identified three potential management units on which to prioritise ground shooting operations.

AB  - Apex predators structure ecosystems by hunting mesopredators and herbivores. These trophic cascades are driven not only by the number of animals they kill, but also by how prey alter their behaviors to reduce risk. The different levels of risk navigated by prey has been likened to a "landscape of fear." In Australia, dingoes are known to suppress red fox populations, driving a trophic cascade. However, most of what we know of this relationship comes from circumstances where predators are persecuted, which can affect their social and trophic interactions. Utilizing camera traps, we monitored fox behavior when accessing key resource points used by territorial dingoes, in a region where both predators are protected. We predicted that foxes would avoid and be more cautious in areas of high dingo activity. Indeed, foxes avoided directly encountering dingoes. However, contrary to our expectations, foxes were not more cautious or vigilant where dingo activity was high. In fact, fox activity and scent-marking rates increased where dingo scent-marking was concentrated. Further, foxes were increasingly confident with increasing levels of conspecific activity. Our results suggest that responses to the threat of predation are more complex than fear alone. In socially stable conditions, it is possible that prey may develop knowledge of their predators, facilitating avoidance, and reducing fear.

AB  - Introduction Given the different life histories and movement behaviors of diverse species, reconciling conservation measures to benefit all species is a critical concern for landscape conservation planning. Understanding land cover composition and finding multispecies movement routes across heterogeneous landscapes are crucial to maintaining many target species. The primary objectives of this study were to determine the optimal environment in Florida that promotes multispecies connectivity in landscapes increasingly threatened by rapid suburban development and to enhance methods for delineating the state's ecological networks.Methods Potential functional connectivity of the focal species with statewide distributions and are considered priorities because of the historical and current threats to their population viability, such as the Florida black bear (Ursus americanus floridanus), Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi), eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon couperi), and southern fox squirrel (Sciurus niger niger), were modeled using Linkage Mapper, Omniscape, and resistant kernels. We combined quantiles from each method for a single species combination approach to leverage the results from the three models for planning purposes. Subsequently, we integrated the results into a novel multiple species, multi-model connectivity mapping approach. Following the corridor analysis, a comparison was made between multispecies connectivity maps, current managed conservation lands, and the main priority areas for the Florida Wildlife Corridor, a previously developed planning network of natural hubs and corridors. Finally, we used the spatial prioritization software Zonation to identify areas of conservation priority, while also illustrating the impacts of infrastructure (built infrastructure, roadways, mining, and future development 2040 and 2070 projections) and threats from human activity (landscape fragmentation, recreation, pollution, contamination, and clean-up sites).Results The study identified priority areas for all four species, with a particular focus on areas not currently protected. The connectivity models showed significant overlap with current managed conservation lands and the main priority areas for the Florida Wildlife Corridor. Pinchpoint areas or bottlenecks were identified as needing fine-scale incorporation into spatial planning. Using the spatial prioritization software Zonation, we identified areas of conservation priority and illustrated the impacts of infrastructure and threats.Discussion The results indicate that species-relevant connectivity models incorporating a group of focal species with both complementary and opposing habitat requirements can better inform biodiversity conservation and landscape design decisions. This multi-model approach provides a robust framework for identifying and prioritizing areas for conservation, particularly in landscapes facing rapid suburban development. Integrating multispecies connectivity models into conservation planning can enhance the effectiveness of ecological networks and contribute to the long-term viability of diverse species in Florida.

AB  - This article examines livelihood practices among Indigenous Aymara pastoral communities in Sajama National Park (SNP) on the Bolivian Altiplano. Pastoralist livelihoods within SNP are based on the management of Andean camelids-llamas (Lama glama) and alpacas (Vicugna pacos)-and the high-elevation peatlands, known locally as bofedales, that provide essential pasture. Aymara pastoralists employ a variety of practices to manage bofedales, including the use of fences to control herd movements and demarcate grazing parcels, known as saya & ntilde;as. Temporary labor migration, within Bolivia or internationally, represents another important livelihood strategy. Fencing facilitates temporary migration by allowing pastoralists to leave their herds unattended and seek wage work. Community-based institutions that govern land tenure and communal obligations incentivize pastoralists to return to their communities. Migration and fences positively impact pastoralists' quality of life, but carry potentially negative consequences for bofedal quality in the form of overgrazing and bofedal degradation. Community-based institutions, fences, and temporary migration together contribute to adaptive livelihoods among pastoralists in SNP.

AB  - The factors that enable the coexistence of closely related species remain a major question in ecology, particularly in human-disturbed habitats. The effects of anthropogenic disturbance and interspecific competition can exacerbate the decline in populations of competing species. The adoption of different strategies in responding to anthropogenic disturbances and competitive avoidances may create opportunities for competing species to coexist. However, few studies have explored how disturbance and competition interact to shape species coexistence. In this study, we conducted long-term and large-scale camera trap surveys comprising 540 sampling sites from 2017 to 2021 at Xishuangbanna, southwestern China, and deployed a spatiotemporal analysis framework to determine the effect of anthropogenic disturbances and competitive avoidances on the coexistence of three sympatric macaque species: Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis; MA), northern pig-tailed macaque (M. leonina; ML), and rhesus macaque (M. mulatta; MM). Macaque species exhibited diverse responses to different types of anthropogenic disturbances. The occurrence probability of MM was positively associated with distance to road and relative abundance of human occurrence, and negatively associated with distance to cropland, which reduces the likelihood of sympatry between MM and the other two species due to their opposing responses to road, cropland, and human occurrence. Conversely, the similar responses to road and cropland increase the sympatry between MA and ML. Three macaque species did not avoid each other through shifting space use or their overall daily activity pattern. However, they delayed using the shared site after other species used it to avoid confrontation. We provide evidence that (1) the spatial co-occurrence pattern of sympatric macaque species was determined by anthropogenic disturbances rather than by competitive spatial avoidance and (2) fine-scale temporary avoidance is the strategy to alleviate their interspecific competition. These results enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to species coexistence of nonhuman primates in human-disturbed habitats.

AB  - Timely and accurate detection and estimation of animal abundance is an important part of wildlife management. This is particularly true for invasive species where cost-effective tools are needed to enable landscape-scale surveillance and management responses, especially when targeting low-density populations residing in dense vegetation and under canopies. This research focused on investigating the feasibility and practicality of using uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) and hyperspectral imagery (HSI) to classify animals in the wild on a spectral-rather than spatial-basis, in the hopes of developing methods to accurately classify animal targets even when their form may be significantly obscured. We collected HSI of four species of large mammals reported as invasive species on islands: cow (Bos taurus), horse (Equus caballus), deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and goat (Capra hircus) from a small UAS. Our objectives of this study were to (a) create a hyperspectral library of the four mammal species, (b) study the efficacy of HSI for animal classification by only using the spectral information via statistical separation, (c) study the efficacy of sequential and deep learning neural networks to classify the HSI pixels, (d) simulate five-band multispectral data from HSI and study its effectiveness for automated supervised classification, and (e) assess the ability of using HSI for invasive wildlife detection. Image classification models using sequential neural networks and one-dimensional convolutional neural networks were developed and tested. The results showed that the information from HSI derived using dimensionality reduction techniques were sufficient to classify the four species with class F1 scores all above 0.85. The performances of some classifiers were capable of reaching an overall accuracy over 98%and class F1 scores above 0.75, thus using only spectra to classify animals to species from existing sensors is feasible. This study discovered various challenges associated with the use of HSI for animal detection, particularly intra-class and seasonal variations in spectral reflectance and the practicalities of collecting and analyzing HSI data over large meaningful areas within an operational context. To make the use of spectral data a practical tool for wildlife and invasive animal management, further research into spectral profiles under a variety of real-world conditions, optimization of sensor spectra selection, and the development of on-board real-time analytics are needed.

AB  - Spread of non-native species can be important drivers of biodiversity declines, leading to precautionary management based on assumptions that (1) non-native biota have negative impacts and are "guilty" of causing harm and (2) reducing a non-native species' abundance will reduce these negative impacts, in turn, benefiting native species. However, we frequently lack data to gauge both negative impacts of non-native species and success or failure of chosen management interventions to benefit native species. Addressing these knowledge gaps is critical to improving management outcomes for native species while maintaining public trust to sustain funding of management activities. Here, we investigated the response of Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) and associated plant communities to implementation of biological control in more than 10 wetland sites in New York State for up to 28 years. Introduced to North America from Europe in the 1800s, L. salicaria is a prime example of a non-native species with a continent-wide distribution that could not be suppressed by mechanical and chemical treatments. In the 1980s, waterfowl biologists, wetland managers, and conservationists alike worried about the loss of diverse wetland plant communities associated with the rapid expansion of L. salicaria. In response, after careful assessments of safety, and potential costs and benefits, four highly host-specific insect herbivores were released in North America in the early 1990s to reduce L. salicaria abundance and its negative ecological impacts. In a companion paper, Blossey et al. documented reduced L. salicaria occupancy and stem densities following insect releases over time (i.e., biological success), irrespective of site-specific differences in starting plant communities or L. salicaria abundance. Here, we show that reduced abundance of L. salicaria leads to the ultimate goal of non-native plant management: increased cover, abundance, and diversity of species, often of native species (i.e., ecological success). We also conduct analyses to provide inference about which plant species are most sensitive to L. salicaria, including changes in L. salicaria stem density. Overall, we provide an important conservation success story: our findings emphasize that biocontrol of non-native plants can be effective and safe, allowing native species to recover as a dominant non-native species gradually declines.

AB  - This study investigated the vegetation growth and forage-livestock balance of desert grasslands at the village scale. This study was chosen to be conducted in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, where desert grasslands are widely distributed and fragility of the environment. This paper establishes a model for estimating time series changes of above-ground biomass (AGB) in the study area based on remote sensing images from the Gaofen-6 satellite, combined with canopy spectra and AGB data of vegetated desert steppe areas. Next, the ecological carrying capacity and load of the desert steppe area were analyzed based on the number of sheep raised in different enclosures and the grazing methods employed. The status of the forage-livestock balance in the study area was assessed after measuring the crop yield of farmland. Finally, data and case support for grazing management in desert steppe were provided in combination with the research results. The study concluded that Gaofen-6 satellite images could quickly and accurately obtain information on vegetation growth and changes in desert grassland areas at a village scale. The available grazing time in a single year in the study area is inadequate to support current stocking levels. When ecological stability is the primary consideration, natural forage obtained through natural conditions cannot meet the needs of farmers for normal grazing and production activities. The suitable grazing time in the study area is limited in any year. The suitable maximum grazing intensity among all plots ranged from 0.334 to 2.541 sheep/ha. In the case of the balance between grass and livestock, the forage obtained from natural pastures could only satisfy 41.71% of the current stocking levels for sheep. Rotational grazing and subsidies for farmers help desert steppe to recover and achieve a forage-livestock balance.

AB  - Quantifying the emotional impact of street greening during the full-leaf seasons in spring, summer, and fall is important for well-being-focused urban construction. Current emotional perception models usually focus on the influence of objects identified through semantic segmentation of street view images and lack explanation. Therefore, interpretability models that quantify street greening's emotional effects are needed. This study aims to measure and explain the influence of street greening on emotions to help urban planners make decisions. This would improve the living environment, foster positive emotions, and help residents recover from negative emotions. In Hangzhou, China, we used the Baidu Map API to obtain street view images when plants were in the full-leaf state. Semantic segmentation was used to separate plant parts from street view images, enabling the calculation of the Green View Index, Plant Level Diversity, Plant Color Richness, and Tree-Sky View Factor. We created a dataset specifically designed for the purpose of emotional perception, including four distinct categories: pleasure, relaxation, boredom, and anxiety. This dataset was generated through a combination of machine learning algorithms and human evaluation. Scores range from 1 to 5, with higher values indicating stronger emotions and lower values indicating less intense ones. The random forest model and Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) algorithm were employed to identify the key indicators that affect emotions. Emotions were most affected by the Plant Level Diversity and Green View Index. These indicators and emotions have an intricate non-linear relationship. Specifically, a higher Green View Index (often indicating the presence of 20-35 fully grown trees within a 200 m range in street view images) and a greater Plant Level Diversity significantly promoted positive emotional responses. Our study provided local planning departments with support for well-being-focused urban planning and renewal decisions. Based on our research, we recommend the following actions: (1) increase the amount of visible green in areas with a low Green View Index; (2) plant seasonal and flowering plants like camellia, ginkgo, and goldenrain trees to enhance the diversity and colors; (3) trim plants in areas with low safety perception to improve visibility; (4) introduce evergreen plants like cinnamomum camphor, osmanthus, and pine.

AB  - Globally, animal populations are facing increasing levels of environmental disturbance. Human activity, land-use change, and global warming are altering migration routes, space use, activity budgets, and the behaviour of many wildlife species. Understanding impacts on wildlife at a fine scale is essential to identify locations of increased disturbance, mitigate its effects, and predict potential population level outcomes. In this work, we introduce a low-cost animal tracking system that integrates open-source electronics, edge machine learning, and an Internet of Things network, to provide real-time information on the location and behaviour of animals. The system employs an on-board machine learning algorithm to identify distinct behaviours and then transmits classification outputs along with location data over a long-range network. We deployed the system on wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus (Burchell, 1823)), in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, a highly social migratory ungulate population that is ecologically and economically vital to the region. Analysis of the transmitted data showed activity readings were consistent with location data and revealed biologically meaningful fluctuations in daily activity patterns. Our system introduces a new dimension to studying animal behaviour and movement ecology by offering immediate insights into the behaviour and location of collared animals.

AB  - We analysed the history behind the current contrasting lichen covers of two adjacent reindeer herding districts at the Finnish-Norwegian border. We conducted vegetation field inventories across the border fence and reconstructed a lichen cover history from 1959 to 2020 using aerial and satellite images. The oldest images showed only a slight difference in lichen cover between the different sides of the border fence. Since the late 1950s, lichen cover has decreased in both districts. At present, lichen biomass is approximately three times greater in in the Norwegian winter pasture than in the Finnish herding district, which has less strictly defined seasonal pastures. A lichen biomass model indicated that lichen intake by reindeer cannot explain the decline in lichen biomass in either of the districts. We suggest that the lichen decline is mainly due to trampling and foraging-induced loss, while other unknown ecological and climatological factors may also be involved.

AB  - Exclusion cages can quantitatively demonstrate the value of natural enemies and the biological control services they provide. Currently, in Washington State, enclosing orchards in netting is being evaluated as a pest control method, but these enclosures may also serve as an exclusion cage to natural enemies, thereby disrupting biological control. To test the effects of net enclosures on apple arthropod communities, we conducted a two-year study comparing apple herbivore, predator, and parasitoid densities in caged and uncaged plots (both receiving insecticides) to an untreated check. Effects on the various groups were influenced by size and motility. Densities of larger motile arthropods, including codling moth (Cydia pomonella (L.)), chrysopids, and syrphids, were lower in the caged plots, demonstrating exclusion. Woolly apple aphid (Eriosoma lanigerum (Hausmann)) and its parasitoid Aphelinus mali (Haldeman) densities in the caged plots were over 100-fold greater and 5-fold greater, respectively, than the other treatments. European earwig (Forficula auricularia (L.)), a generalist predator, was more abundant in the caged plots in 2016 but not in 2017. Spider mites were more abundant in the cage treatments for both years, while predatory mites had higher densities in the cages in 2017 only. These outcomes show that net enclosures change the composition of apple arthropod communities through exclusion of certain herbivores and natural enemies. In the case of some pest herbivores (e.g., codling moth), this exclusion is beneficial, but in the case of predators, it is detrimental. This study further demonstrated that exclusion of only part of the natural enemy complex may be sufficient to cause herbivore outbreaks.

AB  - IntroductionAgriculture and biodiversity conservation are both vitally important human activities that overlap geographically and are often in conflict. Animal agriculture has been implicated in species loss and the degradation of ecosystems due to land clearing, overgrazing, and conflicts with large carnivores such as dingoes (Canis dingo). This paper explores the potential for transformation in Australian commercial livestock production from human-dingo conflict towards social-ecological coexistence. MethodA qualitative model that depicts transformative change was developed from field observations and twenty-one in-depth interviews with livestock producers, conservation researchers, grazing industry representatives and policy makers across Australia. The model articulates the current state of dingo management and the drivers of system change. ResultsSeven pathways are described to catalyse transformation from routine lethal management of dingoes towards a future vision that embeds mutually beneficial coexistence. Central to transformation is the adoption by livestock producers of preventive non-lethal innovations supported by a new farming movement, Predator Smart Farming, that balances livestock grazing and wildlife conservation values to unlock the resilience of landscapes, animals (domesticated and wild) and livelihoods. Other key pathways include targeted research, capacity building, outreach and knowledge sharing networks; institutional (policy, legislation, and economic incentives) and cultural change; public awareness raising and advocacy to reduce lethal control; and greater involvement of Indigenous Australians in decisions relating to wildlife management. DiscussionThe seven transition pathways are discussed in relation to how they can collectively foster coexistence with dingoes in extensive rangelands grazing systems. International examples of interventions are used to illustrate the types of successful actions associated with each pathway that could inform action in Australia. The findings have implications for coexistence with large carnivores in rangeland ecosystems globally.

AB  - Tropical tree-climbing lianas form paths that benefit foraging of dominant ants which might protect the host tree against herbivores. In contrast, lianas are often associated with negative effects on growth and reproduction of host trees due to light obstruction, structural stress and other negative effects. It is unclear if dominant ants could mitigate the negative effects of lianas on host plants. We investigated how lianas and carton nest ants (Azteca chartifex) affected herbivory and reproductive structures of the host tree Byrsonima sericea. Considering 68 trees, almost half of them were naturally colonized by A. chartifex nests (32 trees). We removed lianas from half of the trees (34), establishing a factorial sampling design between A. chartifex and liana presence. We sampled ants and leaf herbivory before and after removing lianas, and measured plant fitness in two consecutive years after removing lianas. Liana removal had no effect on A. chartifex foraging, on leaf herbivory and flower-fruit conversion of host plants. However, A. chartifex decreased leaf herbivory and increased B. sericea flower-fruit conversion irrespective of lianas presence. A noticeable positive effect of ants was detected only in the second year of the experiment, consistently on all plants at each experimental level. The reproductive conditions of the first year resulted in most plants with more than 75% flower-to-fruit conversion success, regardless of the presence of A. chartifex, a success sustained only on those ant-colonized plants in the second year. Our results contribute to understanding multi-trophic interactions in tropical forest canopies as we demonstrated i) that dominant arboreal ants can benefit plants even in a non-obligatory interaction and ii) that the influence of lianas on its host tree is context-dependent, presenting even neutral effects depending on habitat type and species involved.(C) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Despite the diverse and wide-ranging forage availability in abundance in grassland habitat systems, wild ungulates perform selective grazing under their natural foraging conditions as an adaptation to the variation in palatability and availability of forage grasses in different seasons in a given area by retaining the less palatable species as the dry season diet. The study elucidated how the domestic livestock exerts overgrazing pressures on the grass community, removing all the grass stand before the arrival of dry season and restricting forage availability for blackbucks Antilope cervicapra in Basur Amruth Mahal Kaval Conservation Reserve, Karnataka. Direct observations on the feeding behaviours of herbivores were done and opportunistic sampling for the collection and identification of grasses at the same time, covering all different microhabitat characteristic locations of the grassland in all seasons. 29 grass species were identified with different palatability grades and variations in their seasonal availability as forage. Dichanthium annulatum (Forssk.) Stapf and Sehima nervosum (Rottler) Stapf with the highest palatability grade, are spatially declining with the increase of less palatable grasses in the Kaval i.e. Heteropogon contortus (L.) P.Beauv. ex Roem. & Schult. and Chrysopogon fulvus (Spreng.) Chiov under overgrazing pressures. A limitation of three to four months shortage of forage grass availability was created under overgrazing pressures by domestic livestock when compared to selective grazing expectations by blackbucks throughout the year. The forage grasses were grazed to empty by domestic livestock before the arrival of dry seasons. In prolonged overgrazing effects, a competitive replacement of palatable grasses by unpalatable or less palatable species can be expected in these grasslands. Competitive exclusion of blackbucks by the domestic herbivores was modelled using Lotka-Volterra equations. The model revealed that the populations of wild boar and domestic herbivores tend to increase up to their carrying capacities K2 with time ti and attain stable populations, but the blackbuck populations tend to extinction with continuous exposure to competition due to their shy nature. The grass composition can be expected to recover with palatable grasses only if external grazing forces are controlled or avoided.

AB  - Context Invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are the most abundant, widespread, and economically significant large vertebrate established in the Hawaiian Islands. Owing to their generalist diet and rooting behavior, wild pigs alter soils and watersheds, negatively affecting native biota.Aims Lethal removal of wild pigs by trapping is often the most effective and practical management action to reduce their impacts, but terrain and access are challenging.Methods We compared the effectiveness and efficiency of three trap designs (i.e. corral, box, and passive net traps) on a fenced population of wild pigs in a remote montane forest setting on the Island of Hawai'i, where use of cellular-activated 'smart' traps was not possible.Key results During three high-intensity removal efforts between 30 November 2021 and 8 May 2022, we trapped and euthanized 435 wild pigs through 162 trapping events. Although each trap type effectively captured wild pigs, passive net traps captured more wild pigs per capture event than did corral and box traps. Specifically, when using passive net traps, we captured approximately four wild pigs per capture event, which was two to three times more than with corral traps and box traps respectively. Passive net traps were more effective and efficient than were box traps, although they performed similarly to corral traps.Conclusions All trap types we tested successfully captured wild pigs, but passive net traps typically captured more wild pigs per event than did traditional corral and box traps. Net traps were a valuable addition to remote trapping strategies.Implications In remote and rugged settings where smart trapping technology cannot be used, we recommend incorporating passive net traps into a trapping program to optimize removal of wild pigs.

AB  - Fencing is one of the most widely utilized tools for reducing human-wildlife conflict in agricultural landscapes. However, the increasing global footprint of fencing exceeds millions of kilometers and has unintended consequences for wildlife, including habitat fragmentation, movement restriction, entanglement, and mortality. Here, we present a novel and quantitative approach to prioritize fence removal within historic migratory pathways of white-bearded wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) across Kenya's Greater Masai Mara Ecosystem. Our approach first assesses historic and contemporary landscape connectivity of wildebeest between seasonal ranges by incorporating two sets of GPS tracking data and fine-scale fencing data. We then predict connectivity gains from simulated fence removal and evaluate the impact of different corridor widths and locations on connectivity and removal costs derived from locally implemented interventions. Within the study system, we found that modest levels of fence removal resulted in substantial connectivity gains (39%-54% improvement in connectivity for 15-140 km of fence line removed). By identifying the most suitable corridor site, we show that strategically placed narrow corridors outperform larger, more expensive interventions. Our results demonstrate how and where targeted fence removal can enhance connectivity for wildlife. Our framework can aid in identifying suitable and cost-effective corridor restoration sites to guide decision-makers on the removal of fences and other linear barriers. Our approach is transferable to other landscapes where the removal or modification of fences or similar barriers is a feasible mitigation strategy to restore habitat and migratory connectivity.

AB  - Few landscape-scale experiments test the effects of predators on the abundance and distribution of prey across habitat gradients. We use the assisted colonization of a top predator, the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), to test the impacts of predation on the abundance, habitat use and temporal activity of a widespread prey species, the omnivorous common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). Before introduction of devils to Maria Island, Tasmania, Australia, in 2012, possums were abundant in open grasslands as well as forests. Predation by devils caused high mortality of possums in grasslands, but individuals with access to trees had a higher survival probability. Possum abundance declined across the whole island from 2012-2016, as possums disappeared almost completely from grasslands and declined in drier forests with more open understorey. Abundance remained stable in wet forests, which are not preferred habitat for possums but provide better refuge from devils. Abundance and habitat use of possums remained unchanged at a control site on the adjacent Tasmanian mainland, where the devil population was low and stable. This study demonstrates how spatial variation in predator-caused mortality can limit both abundance and habitat breadth in generalist prey species, excluding them entirely from certain habitats.

AB  - Population reduction through hunting and nuisance control has been practiced in many parts of the world to prevent an overabundance of ungulates; however, there is limited knowledge regarding the quantitative impact of intensified hunting management and nuisance control on local dynamics within managed populations. This study examined spatial variations in the local dynamics of sika deer (Cervus nippon) along with hunting and nuisance control across 256 mesh units (23 km2/mesh unit) within the Kushiro subprefecture of Hokkaido, Japan, from 1994 to 2020 (27 years). Under enhanced management, the population declined twice but only by about 14% from the previous peak each time. Since 2017, however, the population has remained stable without further decline. Local densities ranged from 1 to 120 deer/km2 within the area, with higher densities producing higher harvest rates (i.e., density-dependent harvesting). Temporal trends in local densities varied across the mesh units: in some mesh units, sika deer at a high density (>= 50 deer/km2) consistently decreased by more than half, whereas in others, medium densities (25-50 deer/km2) increased following temporal fluctuations, and low densities (<25 deer/km2) remained stable throughout the same period. Thus, the extent of human-induced population reduction locally differed and was likely larger at high-density mesh units. Consequently, the impact of intensified management at the prefecture scale varies locally. Therefore, allocating management efforts to high-density mesh units is preferable for more efficient population control across the entire area.

AB  - Feather mites play an important role in bird communities, covering a wide spectrum of associations with their hosts, ranging from parasitic to mutualistic relations. As a result of long co-evolution with their warm-blooded hosts, this diverse group of arthropods can be found in a wide range of environments where their hosts occur, including the high Arctic. The feather mite fauna of Greenland is poorly known. Herein, we present new data on feather mites found on three species of passerine birds, which were captured on Disko Island (Qeqertarsuaq), West Greenland. The feather mite species Analges longispinosus was found on Snow Bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis); Proctophyllodes plectrophenax on Snow Bunting and Lapland Longspur (Calcarius lapponicus); and Proctophyllodes hipposideros on Northern Wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe). The two Proctophyllodes species represent new records for Greenland. Further studies are needed to reveal the diversity of feather mite species in this remote Arctic region.

AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is distinguished by its diverse ecosystems and biodiversity, which are highly dependent on their soil. In this study, a comprehensive analysis was conducted to assess the ecological risks in Maqin County, located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, along with the local background values of soil elements, level of element enrichment, and source appointment of soil elements. The findings show that the background soil element levels in Maqin County were greater than the average soil content values in China. The soils in the study area exhibited pollution levels ranging from weak to moderate. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was employed to successfully categorized soil elements into four sources: F1 (natural sources), F2 (grazing sources), F3 (volcanic and rock fracture sources), and F4 (intrusive and deep rock source). Based on the characteristics of the ecological communities and the network environmental analysis model, ecological risks were directly introduced through vegetation and soil microorganisms, with subsequent transmission to other components of the ecosystem through the food chain. The integrated risks associated with vegetation, herbivores, soil microorganisms, and carnivores were 0.0106, 0.00193, 0.0282, and 0.00132, respectively. Notably, soil microorganisms were found to be the primary contributors to the total ecological risk in the study area. Furthermore, network environmental analysis and human health risk models revealed that F1, F2, F3, and F4 accounted for 16.85 %, 8.90 %, 21.76 %, and 52.49 % of the input risk of vegetation and soil microorganisms, respectively. Particularly, F4 emerged as the largest contributor to human health risks. This study provides valuable information for the preservation of the ecological environment in pastoral areas, contributing to the global promotion of sustainable ecological practices.

AB  - The Sultanate of Oman boasts remarkable biodiversity, exemplified by such species as the Arabian leopard (Panthera pardus nimr) and the Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx), national symbols that highlight the extensive conservation efforts required to protect the country's natural heritage. During decades, Omani authorities have taken significant measures to safeguard wildlife and preserve the natural environment. A sanctuary dedicated to the reintroduction of the Arabian Oryx, after extinction in nature in 1972, was established in 1980 in the Al Wusta Governorate under the patronage of the Royal Diwan and currently administrated by the recently established Environment Authority. During the almost 40 years since the reintroduction and the creation of the sanctuary, the oryx population has grown slowly but constantly. In 2021, the sanctuary hosted 738 oryx, allowing the start of the reintroduction of the species into the natural environment. Small groups of animals were released into the wild in selected areas. No animal health adverse events were recorded, and mortality was generally due to injuries received as a consequence of fighting, in particular during mating season. Standard veterinary care, including control of internal and external parasites, was regularly provided. In some occasions, immunization against certain diseases, such as clostridial infections, pasteurellosis, or mycoplasmosis, was also applied. In 2023, an FMD outbreak in cattle reported in Dhofar, about 500 km from the Al Wusta sanctuary, motivated specific prophylactic actions to prevent the risk of diffusion to oryx. From December 2023 to January 2024, an immunization program was undertaken using an FMD vaccine against serotypes A, O, and SAT 1, mostly in male oryx, while pregnant oryx were avoided for abortion risk due to handling. The following year, in January 2025, a severe outbreak occurred in oryx herds held in the sanctuary. The rapid onset and the spread of clinical symptoms among animals (100% morbidity in the second day after the first appearance of signs in some individuals) were suggestive of a highly contagious disease. The animals suffered from severe depression and inappetence, rapidly followed by abundant salivation, erosions of the oral mucosa and tongue, and diarrhea, with a short course characterized by prostration and death of the animal in the most severe cases. Therapeutical attempts (administration of antibiotics and rehydration) were mostly ineffective. Laboratory investigations (ELISA and PCR) ruled out contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), Johne's disease and Peste des petits ruminants (PPR). Both serology and antigen detection showed positiveness to foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Out of a total population of 669 present in the sanctuary at the beginning of the outbreak, 226 (33.78%) oryx died. Despite the vaccinal status, the 38.49% of dead animals resulted being vaccinated against FMD. Taking into account the incalculable value of the species, the outbreak represented a very dangerous event that risked wiping out the decades of conservation efforts. Therefore, all the available means, such as accrued biosecurity and adequate prophylaxis, should be implemented to prevent the recurrence of such health risks. The delicate equilibrium of wild fauna in Oman requires study and support for an effective protection, in line with the national plan "Vision 2040", targeting the inclusion of the Sultanate within the 20 best virtuous countries for wildlife protection.

AB  - BackgroundClimate change, nutrient enrichment and land use have been predicted to alter bryophyte abundance and performance; we expect these factors to interact, yet experiments addressing their joint effects are missing.AimsWe tested the responses of Brachythecium rutabulum, a common temperate moss species, to single and combined effects of future climatic conditions, grazing, light limitation and nutrient enrichment. We predicted that future climatic conditions, intense grazing, light limitation and nutrient enrichment have all negative effects on the survival and photosynthetic condition of B. rutabulum, and their joint effects become strong even if individual factors have only weak effects (multiple stress hypothesis).MethodsWe measured after two growing seasons biomass and chlorophyll fluorescence of transplanted moss colonies in full-factorial treatments of fertilisation, exclusion of sheep grazing and light amendment by LED lamps, replicated in ambient and future climatic conditions.ResultsFuture climate and fertilisation had negligible effects on colony biomass and chlorophyll fluorescence of bryophyte colonies, whereas light amendment had positive effect on chlorophyll fluorescence and grazing exclusion had positive effect on colony biomass. Colony biomass and chlorophyll fluorescence decreased with increasing number of global change factors.ConclusionSupporting the multiple stress hypothesis, individually weak global change factors can combine to strong joint effects.
   Multiple global change factors have relatively strong negative effects on a bryophyte even if the effects of single factors are weak.We did not find evidence of multiplicative interactions (e.g. synergies) between multiple global change factors. Nevertheless, the additive effects of combined treatments showed increasing linear response with greater number of factors acting in combination.Amended light availability promotes bryophyte photosynthetic condition, whereas intense grazing may be a disturbance factor having negative effects on bryophytes.Considering multiple global change effects operating simultaneously is required for improved predictions of plant responses to global environmental change.

AB  - The rapid human-driven changes in the environment during the Anthropocene have placed extreme stress on many plants and animals. Beneficial interactions with microorganisms may be crucial for ameliorating these stressors and facilitating the ecosystem services host organisms provide. Foliar endophytes, microorganisms that reside within leaves, are found in essentially all plants and can provide important benefits (e.g., enhanced drought tolerance or resistance to herbivory). However, it remains unclear how important the legacy effects of the abiotic stressors that select on these microbiomes are for affecting the degree of stress amelioration provided to their hosts. To elucidate foliar endophytes' role in host-plant salt tolerance, especially if salinity experienced in the field selects for endophytes that are better suited to improve the salt tolerance of their hosts, we combined field collections of 90 endophyte communities from 30 sites across the coastal Everglades with a manipulative growth experiment assessing endophyte inoculation effects on host-plant performance. Specifically, we grew >350 red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) seedlings in a factorial design that manipulated the salinity environment the seedlings experienced (freshwater vs. saltwater), the introduction of field-collected endophytes (live vs. sterilized inoculum), and the legacy of salinity stress experienced by these introduced endophytes, ranging from no salt stress (0 parts per thousand [ppt] salinity) to high salt stress (40 ppt) environments. We found that inoculation with field-collected endophytes significantly increased mangrove performance across almost all metrics examined (15%-20% increase on average), and these beneficial effects typically occurred when the endophytes were grown in saltwater. Importantly, our study revealed the novel result that endophyte-conferred salinity tolerance depended on microbiome salinity legacy in a key coastal foundation species. Salt-stressed mangroves inoculated with endophyte microbiomes from high-salinity environments performed, on average, as well as plants grown in low-stress freshwater, while endophytes from freshwater environments did not relieve host salinity stress. Given the increasing salinity stress imposed by sea level rise and the importance of foundation species like mangroves for ecosystem services, our results indicate that consideration of endophytic associations and their salinity legacy may be critical for the successful restoration and management of coastal habitats.

AB  - Understanding how animals respond to large-scale environmental changes is difficult to achieve because monitoring data are rarely available for more than the past few decades, if at all. Here, we demonstrate how a variety of palaeoecological proxies (e.g. isotopes, geochemistry and DNA) from an Andean Condor (Vultur gryphus) guano deposit from Argentina can be used to explore breeding site fidelity and the impacts of environmental changes on avian behaviour. We found that condors used the nesting site since at least approximately 2200 years ago, with an approximately 1000-year nesting frequency slowdown from ca 1650 to 650 years before the present (yr BP). We provide evidence that the nesting slowdown coincided with a period of increased volcanic activity in the nearby Southern Volcanic Zone, which resulted in decreased availability of carrion and deterred scavenging birds. After returning to the nest site ca 650 yr BP, condor diet shifted from the carrion of native species and beached marine animals to the carrion of livestock (e.g. sheep and cattle) and exotic herbivores (e.g. red deer and European hare) introduced by European settlers. Currently, Andean Condors have elevated lead concentrations in their guano compared to the past, which is associated with human persecution linked to the shift in diet.

AB  - Wild pig (Sus scrofa) eradication in demographically open populations has seemed an impossible feat for managers, but more recently, whole sounder removal (WSR) has been proposed as a trapping strategy that has the potential to be successful in eradicating wild pigs from an area. However, little empirical data exist concerning implementation of whole sounder removal strategies. Our objective was to implement and describe wild pig management using WSR. We established a 27-km(2) area (northwest section) where sounders were removed using WSR and a 29-km(2) area (southeast section) where GPS collars were deployed on Lowndes Wildlife Management Area in Alabama. Prior to implementing WSR, we used game cameras over bait at a density of one camera/km(2) in November 2014 and counted 65 and 100 individuals in our northwest and southeast sections, respectively. We began WSR July 2015 and by May 2016, we reduced the estimated population by 90%. However, due to births and seasonal movements of pigs in the periphery of the study area, the population fluctuated between 10-20 individuals from May 2016 to December 2017. In December 2017, we removed the last known remaining sounder, and using game cameras, observed no sounders in the northwest section for the following 7 months, the remaining length of the study. We determined that using the WSR approach can lead to a delay before inevitable recolonization. Therefore, WSR can be a successful tool to significantly reduce a wild pig population and potentially provide managers a pig-free area.

AB  - Endemic Hawaiian forest birds have experienced dramatic population declines. The Big Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex (Refuge Complex) was established for the conservation of endangered forest birds and their habitats. Surveys have been conducted at two units of the Refuge Complex to monitor forest bird populations and their response to management actions. We analyzed survey data from 1987 to 2019 at the Hakalau Forest Unit (HFU) and from 1995 to 2019 at the Kona Forest Unit (KFU). We analyzed three strata at HFU: open-forest, closed-forest, and afforested-pasture, and two strata at KFU: upper (>1,524 m elevation) and lower (<,1,524 m). In all years, 'i'iwi Vestiaria coccinea, 'apapane Himatione sanguinea, and Hawai'i 'amakihi Chlorodrepanis virens virens were the most abundant species at HFU. Three endangered forest bird species, Hawai'i 'akepa Loxops coccineus, 'alawi Loxops mana (also known as Hawai'i creeper) and 'akiapola'au Hemignathus wilsoni, had much lower densities. The most abundant species at KFU was 'apapane, followed by Hawai'i 'amakihi at much lower densities. We found a continuation of several trends observed in previous analyses at HFU up to 2012, with most species' trends upward in afforested-pasture stratum, stable in the open-forest stratum, and downward in the closed-forest stratum. However, more species were showing downward trends in all three strata during the most recent decade. Results were mixed at KFU, with most species' trends downward in the upper stratum and upward in the lower stratum. Populations of endangered species were either locally extirpated at KFU or in numbers too low to reliably estimate population abundance. The Refuge Complex is important for conservation of forest birds on Hawai'i Island. Our results show that HFU supports the majority of three endangered forest bird species. Threats to forest birds at the Refuge Complex appear to be having a negative impact. These threats include habitat loss, disease, feral ungulates, and nonnative predators. Continuing and enhancing management actions, such as forest restoration and removal of invasive species, could help mitigate these impacts and allow the Refuge Complex to remain a key site for forest bird conservation in Hawai'i.

AB  - Samples of bryozoans collected from two localities in the Bay of C & aacute;diz with different levels of anthropogenic impact are studied. A total of 25 species was identified, of which 8 are considered non-indigenous (NIS), 12 as native and 5 cryptogenic. A new species of Hippopodina, Hippopodina similis sp. nov., is here described, and corrections to the diagnosis of the genus are proposed. The species appears to be a recent immigrant in C & aacute;diz, although it could also be present in the eastern Mediterranean. Aeverrilla setigera and the genus Hippopodina itself are recorded for the first time in the eastern Atlantic. Anguinella palmata is recorded for the first time in Spanish waters. Amathia vidovici was already recorded in the Iberian Peninsula, but previous records should be confirmed. Other species, such as Amathia verticillata, Biflustra tenuis, Watersipora subatra and Schizoporella errata, were already recorded in the Bay of C & aacute;diz very recently.

AB  - Managing activities that result in human-wildlife conflict is a challenging goal for modern scientists and managers. In recent years, the self-motivated feeding of wildlife by humans has garnered popularity but with consequent risks for the health and safety of both parties. This has resulted in calls for management in areas of high contact, for example, parklands. Traditional controls are typically utilised (i.e. signage, patrols), yet their success is varied, leading to a rise in research aiming to improve them. This research has primarily focused on language and design, with little attention paid to the role that audience type (i.e. international tourists vs. locals/residents) may play in their success. Proportions in audience type present can vary both between parks and spatially within a single park, however, controls are usually applied homogeneously with no consideration for how response may vary between these groups. Here, we performed a robust before-after study across two summers using a wild fallow deer population in a public park that are commonly fed by visitors as our model. We deployed controls, following best practice as outlined by the literature, and tested their overall effectiveness. We then identified key areas with differences in visitor type proportions and tested for variation in success between them. We found that the numbers of visitors feeding the deer significantly decreased overall after the introduction of controls, although interactions were not eliminated entirely. We discovered that the effectiveness of these controls varied with changes in visitor type, with the most positive effects occurring in areas with more international tourists and no significant effect occurring in areas dominated by resident visitors. Notably, of the food offerings remaining, the proportion of foods that could be perceived as 'nutritionally beneficial' increased in both sites, marking overall changes in the behaviours of even those visitors who refused to stop feeding. These findings highlight the importance of target audience research in human-wildlife conflict management. We recommend that authorities aiming to reduce these interactions perform systematic surveys to identify the audience type present and cater controls accordingly to maximise their success.

AB  - The Asian subterranean termite (AST), Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann), is a major structural pest in the world's humid tropics. After its 1999 discovery in Key West, Florida, a survey of buildings infested with AST was initiated. By 2021, a total of 1,703 terrestrial AST encounters were accumulated and used to assess the spatio-temporal spread of AST throughout Key West and adjacent Stock Island between 2005 (which consolidates sightings between 1999 and 2005) and 2021. A lattice-based simulation model was run using selected ecological parameters to predict the infestation locations of AST on Key West from initial encounter points. The distances between annual AST encounters and the nearest marine dockage were compared with the distances between random locations in built areas and the nearest marine dockage. Results show that for the majority of the first ten years up to 2014, the median distance between AST encounters and nearest dockage was significantly smaller than between random points and nearest dockage, but after 2016 encounters became significantly larger for most years. This supports the hypothesis that AST infestations originated from marine dockage (i.e., infested boats). The gradual spread to inland infestations on the island was reflected by a shift of the annual centroid locations westward where domicile density is the greatest. The simulation underestimated the actual extent of infestation in 2021, suggesting secondary non-marine infestation foci. It was concluded that infested trees, for which no records were available, were probably the secondary source of AST spread, and that cryptic tree infestations may have facilitated this accelerated spread. The gradual growth and spread of infested areas were reflected in an increased radius of gyration for annual infested point locations, which also indicated that the AST sites reached saturation and stabilized during the last few years of analysis.

AB  - The Patagonian longfin squid Doryteuthis gahi has an annual life cycle with two seasonal cohorts (autumn and spring spawners). Previous studies estimated the trophic level of adult squid by stable isotope analysis of their muscle or gladius tissues, but few studies compared different sizes and spawning cohorts. In this study, mixed models were used to compare carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope signatures of muscle and gladius tissues of the autumn and spring spawning cohorts and squid of different sizes. A published isoscape model provided delta N-15 baselines to calculate the trophic level of D. gahi. Sampled herbivorous prey such as Euphausiacea, planktonic juveniles Munida gregaria and salps Ihlea supported the trophic level estimates. The autumn spawning cohort had higher delta C-13 values than the spring spawning cohort. delta N-15 values increased with increasing dorsal mantle length, suggesting an ontogenetic change towards larger prey. Muscle tissue was enriched in N-15 but slightly depleted in C-13 compared to gladius tissue. Adult squid had an estimated trophic level of similar to 3.2, with no significant differences between spawning cohorts. Stable isotope values followed a seasonal trend, with lower delta N-15 values and lower delta C-13 value between July and September. Large individuals of the spring spawning cohort were found to have the least niche overlap with other groups of D. gahi. Our study of the trophic levels and ecology of D. gahi can provide important information on its role in the food chain and can build the basis of studies on interaction with other species, and the impact of environmental changes on their populations. This information can inform the development of management strategies aimed at preserving the balance of the ecosystem and ensuring its sustainable use.

AB  - Diverse hypotheses have been proposed with the aim to explain the extinction of Late Pleistocene/Holocene mammals, including the Megafauna from America. Some authors support that human being was the direct responsible of extinction by means of intensive hunting, as proposed by the "blitzkrieg" or overkilling hypothesis. However, evidence is not conclusive. As is well known by biologists, exotic diseases may play an important role in local extinction of diverse vertebrates. On this basis, some speculated that the arrival of man may also have introduced new diseases that may have played an important role on native mammals, especially megafaunal populations, probably constituting a key factor on their extinction. Recent findings of the parasite Fasciola hepatica in endemic deer from Holocene sites in Patagonia (and also probably from camelids in Peru) previous to Hispanic colonization constitute indirect evidence that may sustain this hypothesis. Because one of the main definite host of this parasite are humans, this potential disease may have been introduced by human populations as hosts and then disperse through the entire continent, as evidenced by the finding of Fasciola hepatica in Patagonia. Its presence in endemic deer and camelids previous to Hispanic colonization, reinforces the proposal that human-related diseases may have played some role in Late Pleistocene extinction of large native mammals.

AB  - Different theories have been proposed to explain the phenotypic changes observed in island lineages, but it remains unclear if predictable evolutionary trajectories can be identified within island communities. Using a 3D functional space approach, we tested whether insular endemic species tend to evolve towards apparent holes in niche space (expecting niche filling) or tend to become generalists, that is, moving towards the centre of the functional space (expecting niche expansion). We tested these two hypotheses in 378 insular endemic species from 24 islands of 8 archipelagos, including 177 prehistoric anthropogenically extinct species. Analyses were conducted with and without accounting for species size difference. We found that 57% of island endemic species evolved towards more unoccupied regions of the global morphospace (i.e. more distinct body sizes compared to the ones of their ancestors), suggesting a tendency for niche filling. When adjusted traits for body size, we found that half of the endemic species (50%) showed more distinct trait values than their ancestors. Results also revealed that certain dietary niches (terrestrial herbivores and nectarivores) evolved distinct body sizes more frequently. Differences noted between islands and archipelagos suggest that biogeographic factors may influence evolutionary trajectory and interactions between these two hypotheses. Our study confirms that extinct species occupied specific niches that have been left vacant, suggesting that these evolutionary 'oddities' could be more sensitive to extinction. Overall, it calls for a global assessment of the avian functional diversity lost from recent extinctions.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Free-ranging and captive cervid herds are at risk for chronic wasting disease transmission from direct contacts at fences, so we explored the use of a secondary electric fence to prevent contacts in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Using a captive herd of white-tailed deer in Pennsylvania, USA, we tested the efficacy of two electric fence designs (one three-strand and one six-strand) constructed along separate primary fence lines (each composed of 20 m of chain link and 20 m of woven wire fencing) dividing paddocks of captive deer. From June to November 2019, we conducted three trials of variable lengths to assess how season, age, and sex impacted behavior and motivation of deer to breach the electric fence. When no electric fence was in place, we observed 117 direct contacts through woven wire and chain link fences. With the electric fences in place, we observed electric fence breaches (which led to direct contact between deer) by weaned fawns (37 breaches, 4 direct contacts) and males in the mid- and late-rut (2 breaches, 1 direct contact). The majority of breaches occurred across the three-strand-fence. Our results suggest that no style of primary fence alone is sufficient to prevent direct contacts and that the addition of a secondary, properly designed electric fence constructed along the primary fence of captive white-tailed deer facilities could prevent direct contact between captive and free-ranging deer.

AB  - Pinnipeds are sentinel species for marine pollution, but their role as vectors of trace elements (TEs) or rare earth elements (REEs) to ecosystems has been poorly studied. The present study tested pinniped feces for 61 elements, including REEs. Feces of adult seals (Mirounga leonina, Hydrurga leptonyx) from Fildes Bay, King George Island, Antarctica, were analyzed by ICP-MS. TEs varied by several orders of magnitude across the suite examined herein, with Fe, Al, Zn, Mn, HgII and Sr as the top six in both species. Of the REEs, Ce, Dy, Er, Eu, Gd, Ho, La, Lu, Nd, Pr, Sc, Sm, Tb, Y and Yb were found consistently in all samples and ranged from 0.935 to 0.006 mu g g(-1) d.w. The results show that both species act as biovector organisms of TEs and REEs through feces in remote environments, whose actual impacts and long-term fate need further exploration.

AB  - Algal turfs form a critical interface on coral reefs that interacts with several key ecosystem processes. While we know these turfs have a remarkable propensity to accumulate sediments, which can have a range of ecosystem impacts, their role as sinks for heavy metals remains largely unexamined. Here we quantified the concentration of 15 metals in algal turf sediments from Lizard Island and Orpheus Island on the Great Barrier Reef, and specifically explored how the loads of arsenic, cobalt, iron and lead were related to turf length. Metal composition differed markedly between the two islands, with the composition at Orpheus Island suggesting closer links to terrestrial sediment sources. Furthermore, metal loads increased significantly with turf length, suggesting that longer turfs can accumulate these pollutants on reefs. Given that algal turfs are a crucial component of herbivorous/detritivorous trophic pathways, this could represent a key juncture at which these metals enter food chains.

AB  - Population reduction through hunting and nuisance control has been practiced in many parts of the world to prevent an overabundance of ungulates; however, there is limited knowledge regarding the quantitative impact of intensified hunting management and nuisance control on local dynamics within managed populations. This study examined spatial variations in the local dynamics of sika deer (Cervus nippon) along with hunting and nuisance control across 256 mesh units (23 km(2)/mesh unit) within the Kushiro subprefecture of Hokkaido, Japan, from 1994 to 2020 (27 years). Under enhanced management, the population declined twice but only by about 14% from the previous peak each time. Since 2017, however, the population has remained stable without further decline. Local densities ranged from 1 to 120 deer/km(2) within the area, with higher densities producing higher harvest rates (i.e., density-dependent harvesting). Temporal trends in local densities varied across the mesh units: in some mesh units, sika deer at a high density (>= 50 deer/km(2)) consistently decreased by more than half, whereas in others, medium densities (25-50 deer/km(2)) increased following temporal fluctuations, and low densities (<25 deer/km(2)) remained stable throughout the same period. Thus, the extent of human-induced population reduction locally differed and was likely larger at high-density mesh units. Consequently, the impact of intensified management at the prefecture scale varies locally. Therefore, allocating management efforts to high-density mesh units is preferable for more efficient population control across the entire area.

AB  - Assessing the geographic distribution and abundance of invasive species is critical for developing sound management and/or eradication policies. Ecological niche modeling approaches that make implicit assumptions about the biology and the effect of aggregate weather are commonly used to predict the potential distribution of invasive species based on their recorded distribution. An alternative approach is weather-driven physiologically based demographic modeling (PBDM), which explicitly incorporates the mathematical description of the observed biology, including trophic interactions, to predict the temporal phenology and dynamics of the species across wide geographic areas. The invasive weed yellow starthistle (YST) (Centaurea solstitialis; Asteraceae) and its interactions with annual grasses and herbivorous biological control agents are used to demonstrate the PBDM approach for analyzing complex invasive species problems. The PBDM predicts the distribution and relative abundance of YST across the western United States, and the results are used to assess climatic effects of temperature, rainfall, competition from grasses and the efficacy of biocontrol efforts including the introduction of a root-feeding weevil to control YST in North America. The model could also include direct effects of rising carbon dioxide levels on YST developmental biology.

AB  - Invasive species are a global threat to biodiversity and there is a pressing need to better understand why some species become invasive outside of their native range, and others do not. One explanation for invasive species success is their release from concurrent natural enemies upon introduction to the non-native range. The so-called enemy release hypothesis (ERH) has conflicting support, depending upon the ecosystem and species investigated. To date, most studies testing the generality of the ERH have focused on terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we tested whether enemy release might contribute to the success of the invasive non-native brown seaweeds Undaria pinnatifida and Sargassum muticum in the United Kingdom. We conducted choice and no choice experiments to determine herbivore preference on these invaders relative to six functionally-similar native species. We also measured and compared species traits associated with defence against herbivory (carbon to nitrogen ratio, polyphenolic concentration, tensile strength, and compensatory growth). There were no differences in the biomass consumed between invasive and native species for either choice or no choice tests. The carbon to nitrogen ratio (a measure of nutritional quality) was significantly lower for S. muticum compared to the three native fucoid species, but measures of the other three defence traits were similar or even greater for invasive species compared with native species. Taken together, it is unlikely that the ERH applies to invasive seaweeds in the northeast Atlantic, suggesting that other factors may contribute to the success of invasive species in this system.

AB  - Herbivory and nutrient availability are fundamental drivers of benthic community succession in shallow marine systems, including coral reefs. Despite the importance of early community succession for coral recruitment and recovery, studies characterizing the impact of top-down and bottom-up drivers on micro- and macrobenthic communities at scales relevant to coral recruitment are lacking. Here, a combination of tank and field experiments were used to assess the effects of herbivore exclusion and nutrient enrichment on micro- to macrobenthic community succession and subsequent coral recruitment success. Herbivore exclusion had the strongest effect on micro- and macrobenthic community succession, including a community shift toward copiotrophic and potentially opportunistic/pathogenic microorganisms, an increased cover of turf and macroalgae, and decreased cover of crustose coralline algae. Yet, when corals settled prior to the development of a macrobenthic community, rates of post-settlement survival increased when herbivores were excluded, benefiting from the predation refugia provided by cages during their vulnerable early post-settlement stage. Interestingly, survival on open tiles was negatively correlated with the relative abundance of the bacterial order Rhodobacterales, an opportunistic microbial group previously associated with stressed and diseased corals. Development of micro- and macrobenthic communities in the absence of herbivory, however, led to reduced coral settlement. In turn, there were no differences in post-settlement survival between open and caged treatments for corals settled on tiles with established benthic communities. As a result, open tiles experienced marginally higher recruitment rates, driven primarily by the higher initial number of settlers on open tiles compared to caged tiles. Overall, we reveal that the primary interaction driving coral recruitment is the positive effect of herbivory in creating crustose coralline algae (CCA)-dominated habitats, free of fleshy algae and associated opportunistic microbes, to enhance coral settlement. The negative direct and indirect impact of fish predation on newly settled corals was outweighed by the positive effect of herbivory on the initial rate of coral settlement. In turn, the addition of nutrients further altered benthic community succession in the absence of herbivory, reducing coral post-settlement survival. However, the overall impact of nutrients on coral recruitment dynamics was minor relative to herbivory.

AB  - Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) is a multi-host pathogen with sheep and goats as main hosts. To investigate the role of cattle in the epidemiology of PPR, we simulated conditions similar to East African zero-grazing husbandry practices in a series of trials with local Zebu cattle (Bos taurus indicus) co-housed with goats (Capra aegagrus hircus). Furthermore, we developed a mathematical model to assess the impact of PPRV-transmission from cattle to goats. Of the 32 cattle intranasally infected with the locally endemic lineage IV strain PPRV/Ethiopia/Habru/2014 none transmitted PPRV to 32 co-housed goats. However, these cattle or cattle co-housed with PPRV-infected goats seroconverted. The results confirm previous studies that cattle currently play a negligible role in PPRV-transmission and small ruminant vaccination is sufficient for eradication. However, the possible emergence of PPRV strains more virulent for cattle may impact eradication. Therefore, continued monitoring of PPRV circulation and evolution is recommended.
   Field trials and modeling in East Africa suggest zebu cattle, often co-housed with goats under zero-grazing conditions, show no evidence of transmitting PPRV to goats, supporting the strategy of focusing vaccination on small ruminants for PPR eradication in mixed-species systems.

AB  - Humid, subtropical grazing lands utilized for cattle production are significant agroecosystems that are important for economic production, global food security, and biodiversity. Prescribed fire, an important management tool, is used for controlling woody plant encroachment, maintaining wildlife habitat, and stimulating forage regrowth. Fire also interacts with grazing to maintain grassland structure and heterogeneity. Understanding this firegrazing interaction is important to producers because spatio-temporal cattle behavior has been linked to both livestock production and environmental impact through patterns of pasture utilization. The goal of the study was to understand how two fire regimes affected spatial and temporal grazing behavior, including grazing intensity, grazing evenness, and circadian and seasonal grazing patterns. A randomized block design experiment was established in 2017 with 16 pastures (16 ha each), at Archbold Biological Station's Buck Island Ranch in FL, USA. We examined two prescribed fire management techniques, one represented the prevailing practice of the region with prescribed fire applied to entire pastures (full burn = FB), and the other 'alternative' regime applied patchburn (PB), in which one-third of a pasture was burned each year. Here we present results from the first year of the study, after the first patch-burns and the full burns were implemented. Global Positioning System data loggers on cows recorded 5-min location fixes to track cows and cattle grazing behavior was inferred based on distances between GPS locations. Cattle behavior was significantly different in PB vs. FB pastures. Over a year with five grazing periods, cattle spent on average 38% more time grazing in burned vs unburned patches within PB pastures. PB burned patches were also grazed with a more even spatial distribution compared to unburned patches. In contrast, in FB pastures, cattle grazing intensity and evenness were similar across the entire pasture. Time of day, temperature, season, and fire treatment all had small effects on the circadian cattle grazing patterns. Our study suggests that PB can be a management tool to manipulate cattle behavior in humid subtropical grazinglands, with potential implications for pasture utilization and beef production, carbon and nutrient cycling, and wildlife habitat.

AB  - Natural or anthropogenic movement of plant species outside their historical ranges may result in exposure to new environmental conditions and a lack of natural enemies, thus promoting their establishment and spread into new areas. A biogeographical comparison of native and invasive populations can provide insight into the mechanisms of successful invasions and guide effective management strategies, such as biological control, by targeting plant traits that promote invasiveness. We studied the Eurasian aquatic plant, Nymphoides peltata, in situ in the native (China, Korea) and invaded (USA) ranges to determine whether there were differences in natural enemy attack rates (percent leaf damage, frequency of leaf herbivory or disease), productivity (plant cover, reproduction), and leaf traits (leaf elemental content, leaf toughness, dry matter content, specific leaf area) between areas. We also investigated whether there was evidence of a tradeoff between natural enemy attack and growth or reproduction, as would be predicted by invasion theory. Plant cover (23-29 % higher) and reproductive output (eight times more seeds / m2) were consistently higher in the invaded range. Leaf traits consistently differed between ranges, which we would expect if plants in the invaded range had fewer herbivores or other pests. The amount of leaf damage present was similar between ranges, but the frequency of herbivory was 50 % greater, on average, in the native than invaded range. Although we did not quantify suppression of N. peltata by natural enemies, we found evidence of more frequent herbivory in Asia and reduced reproduction and plant cover compared to the USA, which supports further investigation into viability of biological controls.

AB  - Mechanisms promoting stable coexistence allow multiple species to persist in the same trophic level of a given network of species interactions. One of the most common stabilizing mechanisms of coexistence is niche differentiation, such as temporal and spatial patchiness. To understand the limits of coexistence between species we have to understand the limits of competitive interactions which translate in species exclusion or patterns of non-co-occurrence.
   We evaluated spatiotemporal niche-based mechanisms that could promote stable coexistence between ants and spiders which forage on extrafloral nectary (EFN)-bearing plants. We observed co-occurrence and overlapping patterns between ants and spiders in a temporal and spatial scale in nine different EFN-bearing plant species in a Neotropical savanna, using both community and species-level approach.
   Ants and spiders showed asynchrony of their abundances over the year with low temporal overlapping patterns between them (temporal niche specialization). Greater abundance of ants occurred between September and March, whereas greater abundance of spiders occurred between March and August, exactly at the time when the abundance of ants decreases on plants. However, there might also be some levels of temporal overlapping, but then individual ants and spiders occupy different branches (spatial segregation). Finally, we also observed a spatial negative effect of the abundance of ants on the presence of spiders.
   Our results suggest that spatiotemporal partitioning between ants and spiders may be one of the potential mechanisms behind a stable coexistence between these two groups of organisms that forage on EFN-bearing plants in the Brazilian savanna.

AB  - Native forests around the world are widely used for livestock grazing as they offer different sources of forage. Nevertheless, in heterogeneous forested landscapes, forage productivity drivers are still unclear, hindering precise predictions of field receptivity. Our aim is to relate landscape variables with forage productivity in forested landscapes using satellite and ground-based data. To accomplish this, we harvested 36 enclosures in two Patagonian valleys during a three-year period. The location of the enclosures encompassed a gradient of altitude and mean annual rainfall, across three vegetation types commonly used for cattle raising. We estimated five generalized linear models to predict forage productivity using different remote sensing and ground (field) data as predictors. The most important variables for predicting forage productivity were five of remote sensing type and two of field type. The highest goodness of fit was obtained when all variables were included (D2 = 0.71). When ground-based information was combined with remote sensing data, the goodness of fit was higher (D2 = 0.65) compared with models that only used remote data as predictors (D2 = 0.49). Models obtained based on remote data serve to support situations where field information is not available. High forage productivity levels can be obtained in high forests or scrubs with varying values of canopy openness, without removing the forest. The models generated in this work improve livestock stocking rates adjustment in NW Patagonia forests, and may be also re-estimated with new data in other regions used for cattle raising worldwide, contributing to the sustainable use of native forests.

AB  - Mammals often follow peculiar evolutionary trajectories on islands, with some Pleistocene insular large mammals exhibiting reduced relative brain size. However, the antiquity of this phenomenon remains unclear. Here, we report the first digital endocast of an insular artiodactyl, the five-horned ruminant Hoplitomeryx matthei from the Late Miocene Gargano palaeo-island (Apulia, Italy). We compare its brain morphology with that of extant and extinct relatives, including the early bovid Eotragus and the Mid-Miocene cervid Euprox, and investigate endocranial size and shape variation across 35 ruminant species. H. matthei displays a derived pecoran brain morphology, similar to that of bovids. This finding suggests that its ancestor, rather than deriving from an Oligocene member of Tragulina, was a Pecora and colonized Gargano no earlier than the Early Miocene. This is further supported by its encephalization quotient and the presence of a prominent marginal pole at the top of its endocasts, also found in Caprini. However, unlike the Balearian mouse goat Myotragus balearicus, H. matthei does not exhibit a reduced occipital region of the neocortex or olfactory bulbs. Instead, it underwent only a minor brain size reduction, highlighting distinct pathways of brain evolution in different island ecosystems. This study provides new insights into the biogeographic history of Hoplitomeryx and the palaeoneuroanatomy of insular mammals prior to the Quaternary.

AB  - Historically, the excavation in the 1970s and publication in the 80s of Rhinoceros sinensis hayasakai (now known as Nesorhinus hayasakai) represents a milestone in vertebrate paleontology in Taiwan. However, the type materials (including 22 syntypes) are missing after the 1984 publication due to the lack of proper curation and management and reflect the undervalued vertebrate paleontology in Taiwan. Here we found five original specimens out of 22 in two collections ( National Taiwan University and Tainan City Zuojhen Fossil Park). The original 22 specimens were recovered from two geographical localities and geological horizons: northern (Taoyuan, Tunghsiao Formation: Early Pleistocene) and southern (Tainan, Chiting Formation: Middle Pleistocene) Taiwan. Our rediscovery of long-forgotten type materials emphasizes the importance of proper specimen curation. Similarly, by clarifying the historical issues and collecting more fossils, vertebrate paleontology from Taiwan promises to offer novel perspectives to understand the origin of modern biodiversity and large-scale extinctions along the eastern margin of Eurasia.

AB  - The invasive snake Hemorrhois hippocrepis colonized the island of Ibiza (Balearic Islands) in 2003 as stowaways inside trunks of olive trees imported for gardening. It has quickly spread since 2010, posing a threat to the island's only remaining endemic vertebrate, the Ibiza wall lizard Podarcis pityusensis. We map the yearly expansion rate of the snake and estimate via transect surveys how severely it affects the distribution and abundance of the endemic lizard. As well, we surveyed 9 of 30 small lizard populations on islets surrounding Ibiza that have been isolated since the Last Glacial Maximum. Snakes had invaded 49% of Ibiza's land area by 2018, and censuses show a critical contrast in lizard abundance between areas with and without snakes; almost all censuses in areas without snakes show lizard presence whereas nearly all censuses in areas with H. hippocrepis lack lizard sightings. Moreover, at least one subspecies previously thriving on one of the offshore islets has become extinct, and there have been several snakes recorded swimming between Ibiza and the surrounding islets. Therefore, lizard populations have been dramatically reduced or have vanished within the range of the snake, and our results quantitatively support upgrading this species' threat level for extinction. This study can inform to programs to manage invasive snake populations and to conservation actions to recover the endemic lizard.

AB  - Gut microbial communities provide essential functions to their hosts and are known to influence both their ecology and evolution. However, our knowledge of these complex associations is still very limited in reptiles. Here we report the 16S rRNA gene faecal microbiota profiles of two lizard species endemic to the Balearic archipelago (Podarcis lilfordi and P. pityusensis), encompassing their allopatric range of distribution through a noninvasive sampling, as an alternative to previous studies that implied killing specimens of these IUCN endangered and near-threatened species, respectively. Both lizard species showed a faecal microbiome composition consistent with their omnivorous trophic ecology, with a high representation of cellulolytic bacteria taxa. We also identified species-specific core microbiota signatures and retrieved lizard species, islet ascription, and seasonality as the main factors in explaining bacterial community composition. The different Balearic Podarcis populations are characterised by harbouring a high proportion of unique bacterial taxa, thus reinforcing their view as unique and divergent evolutionary entities.

AB  - The decomposition process is an important factor in forensics, and flies play a crucial role in the decomposition of animals and humans. However, there remains limited information on the effect of flies that attend death scenes. This study assesses the effect of the presence or absence of blowflies on the rate and process of cadaver decomposition in the spring, summer, and autumn from 2016 to 2020 on Yeongdo Island, Busan, South Korea. Nine blowfly species belonging to four genera in two subfamilies were sampled. The blowflies that approached the cadavers differed between seasons, but Chrysomya pinguis (Walker) was the dominant species regardless of the season. Blowfly presence on cadavers significantly affected the duration of the decomposition stage and the pattern of weight loss in nearly all scenarios. With the presence of blowflies, the decomposition rate was four times faster in spring, three times faster in summer, and nine times faster in autumn. These results show that the presence or absence of blowflies is an essential factor in the decomposition process of cadavers. Therefore, it should be taken into account when estimating postmortem intervals in medicolegal forensic entomology.

AB  - Megaherbivore grazing (e.g. by turtles, and sirenians) plays a major and well-documented role in structuring seagrass meadows around the world; however, we know little about local-scale (intra- and inter-meadow) variability in megaherbivore grazing. This is surprising given that megaherbivores are highly selective eaters who may feed by targeting certain meadows, or areas within a meadow. We ran an experiment in the Great Barrier Reef to test the question: How does megaherbivory vary on a regional scale? We used megaherbivore exclusion cages in 5 meadows along a 50 km region of coastline around Gladstone in the southern Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area to understand variability in megaherbivory between meadows. We found differences in the impacts of megaherbivore grazing on seagrass biomass and shoot heights between meadows. There were also interannual differences in grazing impacts at one meadow that had been studied previously. These differences may be due to megaherbivore population and grazing dynamics, as well as the response of seagrass to grazing pressure. Our results show that seagrass meadows grazed by megaherbivores are dynamic systems that vary on regional spatial scales as well as over time. This is important for management measures that seek to consider the seagrass-herbivore system as a whole and understand the implications of monitoring efforts based on seagrass aboveground condition.

AB  - Ecological theory predicts that herbivory should be weaker on islands than on mainland based on the assumption that islands have lower herbivore abundance and diversity. However, empirical tests of this prediction are rare, especially for insect herbivores, and those few tests often fail to address the mechanisms behind island-mainland divergence in herbivory. In particular, past studies have not addressed the relative contribution of top-down (i.e. predator-driven) and bottom-up (i.e. plant-driven) factors to these dynamics. To address this, we experimentally excluded insectivorous vertebrate predators (e.g. birds, bats) and measured leaf traits associated with herbivory in 52 populations of 12 oak (Quercus) species in three island-mainland sites: The Channel Islands of California vs. mainland California, Balearic Islands vs. mainland Spain, and the island Bornholm vs. mainland Sweden (N = 204 trees). In each site, at the end of the growing season, we measured leaf damage by insect herbivores on control vs. predator-excluded branches and measured leaf traits, namely: phenolic compounds, specific leaf area, and nitrogen and phosphorous content. In addition, we obtained climatic and soil data for island and mainland populations using global databases. Specifically, we tested for island-mainland differences in herbivory, and whether differences in vertebrate predator effects or leaf traits between islands and mainland contributed to explaining the observed herbivory patterns. Supporting predictions, herbivory was lower on islands than on mainland, but only in the case of Mediterranean sites (California and Spain). We found no evidence for vertebrate predator effects on herbivory on either islands or mainland in any study site. In addition, while insularity affected leaf traits in some of the study sites (Sweden-Bornholm and California), these effects were seemingly unrelated to differences in herbivory. Synthesis. Our results suggest that vertebrate predation and the studied leaf traits did not contribute to island-mainland variation patterns in herbivory, calling for more nuanced and comprehensive investigations of predator and plant trait effects, including measurements of other plant traits and assessments of predation by different groups of natural enemies.
   La teor & iacute;a ecol & oacute;gica predice que la herbivor & iacute;a ha de ser m & aacute;s d & eacute;bil en las islas que en el continente, ya que las islas tienen una menor abundancia y diversidad de herb & iacute;voros. Sin embargo, todav & iacute;a no contamos con suficiente evidencia emp & iacute;rica que apoye estas predicciones, especialmente en lo que se refiere a la herbivor & iacute;a por insectos, y los pocos estudios que existen a menudo no abordan los mecanismos que generan estos patrones de divergencia entre islas y continente en los niveles de herbivor & iacute;a. En particular, las investigaciones previas no han examinado la contribuci & oacute;n relativa de las fuerzas top-down (es decir, efectos mediados por los depredadores) y bottom-up (es decir, efectos mediados por los rasgos funcionales de las plantas) en estas din & aacute;micas. En este trabajo, excluimos experimentalmente a depredadores insect & iacute;voros vertebrados (p. ej., aves, murci & eacute;lagos) y medimos rasgos foliares asociados con la herbivor & iacute;a en 52 poblaciones de 12 especies de robles (Quercus) en tres sitios insulares y continentales: las Islas del Canal de California vs. California continental, las Islas Baleares vs. Espa & ntilde;a continental, y la isla de Bornholm vs. Suecia continental (N = 204 & aacute;rboles). En cada sitio, al final de la & eacute;poca de crecimiento, medimos el da & ntilde;o foliar causado por insectos herb & iacute;voros en ramas control vs. ramas con exclusi & oacute;n de depredadores, y medimos diferentes rasgos foliares, en particular, la concentraci & oacute;n de compuestos fen & oacute;licos, el & aacute;rea foliar espec & iacute;fica y el contenido de nitr & oacute;geno y f & oacute;sforo. Adem & aacute;s, obtuvimos datos clim & aacute;ticos y de suelo de las poblaciones insulares y continentales utilizando bases de datos globales. Espec & iacute;ficamente, evaluamos los efectos de la insularidad sobre la herbivor & iacute;a y si exist & iacute;an patrones contrastados de los efectos de depredaci & oacute;n y expresi & oacute;n de rasgos foliares entre islas y continentes que contribuyesen a explicar los patrones observados en la herbivor & iacute;a. De acuerdo con la teor & iacute;a ecol & oacute;gica, la herbivor & iacute;a fue menor en las islas en comparaci & oacute;n con el continente, pero solo en el caso de los sitios mediterr & aacute;neos (California y Espa & ntilde;a). No encontramos evidencia de efectos de los depredadores sobre la herbivor & iacute;a en ninguno de los sitios de estudio, ya sea en las islas o en el continente. Adem & aacute;s, aunque la insularidad afect & oacute; a la expresi & oacute;n de rasgos foliares en algunos de los sitios de estudio (Suecia-Bornholm y California), estos efectos no estuvieron aparentemente relacionados con las diferencias observadas en la herbivor & iacute;a. S & iacute;ntesis. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la depredaci & oacute;n por vertebrados y los rasgos foliares estudiados no contribuyeron a los patrones de variaci & oacute;n entre islas y continente observados en los niveles de herbivor & iacute;a, lo que plantea la necesidad de investigaciones m & aacute;s exhaustivas que incluyan la evaluaci & oacute;n de otros rasgos funcionales y evaluaciones de la depredaci & oacute;n por otros grupos de enemigos naturales de los herb & iacute;voros.

AB  - Investigator disturbance while monitoring seabirds can result in lower survival rates and breeding success, leaving lasting negative impacts on the population and biasing observations. For example, monitoring rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) and other burrowing alcids can reduce breeding success or even survival through handling stress and damage to nesting habitat. For this reason, researchers must seek to decrease colony disturbance. Automated radio-frequency identification (RFID) via passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags is an inexpensive and reliable way to identify individual presence and record attendance behaviour, avoiding the need to recapture seabirds or visit the colony frequently. PIT tags either can be implanted subcutaneously or attached externally to leg bands, but it is unclear which method causes lower disturbance. To examine the impact of PIT tagging on rhinoceros auklets nesting in artificial burrows on Middleton Island, Alaska, we monitored burrow entrances with automated recording RFID readers to collect presence and nest attendance data. PIT-tagged (either band attachment or subcutaneous implant) and control birds had similar breeding success and chick growth rates. Breeding success was similar between nests with one or two parents marked. Birds tagged externally were detected less often than birds marked with a subcutaneous implant. We conclude that PIT tagging of rhinoceros auklets is a relatively non-invasive method for seabird monitoring, and that subcutaneous implants do not cause more disturbance than external attachment.

AB  - Understanding the long-term interactions between people and the ecosystem in which they live is vital for informing present-day ecosystem management plans. The use of pollen data for palaeoecological reconstructions is often limited by the low taxonomic resolution of pollen, which often reduces the detail of reconstructions of human influence on past vegetation. This is true for Australia where Myrtaceae, particularly Eucalyptus species, dominate the landscape, but their pollen is difficult to differentiate. We present a pollen record with high taxonomic resolution of Myrtaceae pollen from the Bass Strait area of southeast Australia, focusing on the period of major human occupation there during the Late Glacial transition. These results were compared to records of hydrology, fire, sediment deposition, herbivore abundance and human occupation. We found that Indigenous burning practices promoted open, subgenus Monocalyptus Eucalyptus woodland at the expense of dense subgenus Symphomyrtus Eucalyptus forest. Previous studies have shown the need for management of the vegetation of southeast Australia guided by Indigenous people, to promote ecosystem resilience and reduce the risk of wildfires. Our results reveal that in addition to reducing wildfires, cultural burning by Indigenous people has the potential to promote the diversity of ecosystems and habitats.

AB  - Simple Summary: This study was designed to find the cause of microcytic anemia in the Przewalski's gazelle by investigating the mineral contents in its habitat. We found that the cause of the disease was selenium deficiency in the habitat, and then, a cure for the disease was discovered. It is extremely beneficial to protect the rare species of the Przewalski's gazelle. Due to the fencing of the Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii), the microcytic anemia incidence rate continues to increase. The primary pathological symptoms include emaciation, anemia, pica, inappetence, and dyskinesia. To investigate the cause of microcytic anemia ailment in the Przewalski's gazelle, the Upper Buha River Area with an excessive incidence was chosen as the experimental pasture, and the Bird Island Area without microcytic anemia disease was chosen as the control field. Then, the mineral contents in the soil, forage, blood, and liver, as well as the blood routine parameters and biochemical indexes were measured. The findings showed that the experimental pasture had much lower Se content in the soil and forage than the control field (p < 0.01), while the impacted pasture had significantly higher S content in the forage. The damaged gazelles had considerably lower Se and Cu contents and higher S content in the blood and liver than the healthy gazelles (p < 0.01). The presences of Hb, HCT, MCV, and MCH were significantly decreased compared to those in healthy gazelles (p < 0.01). The experimental group had a significantly lower level of GSH-Px activity in their serums compared to the control group (p < 0.01). In the treatment experiment, ten gazelles from the affected pasture were orally administered CuSO4, 6 g/animal once every 10 days for two consecutive times, and all gazelles were successfully cured. Therefore, it is possible that low Se content in the soil induced an increase in the absorption of S content by forage, leading to the deficiency of secondary Cu in the Przewalski's gazelles, resulting in microcytic anemia.

AB  - The role of facilitation in shaping natural communities has primarily been studied in the context of plant assemblages, while its relevance for mobile animals remains less understood. Our study investigates whether reciprocal interspecific facilitation may exist between fire ants (Solenopsis richteri) and cavies (Cavia aperea), two mobile animals, in the SW Atlantic coast brackish marshes. Field samples showed a spatial association between ant mounds and cavies, and that ants prefer to use cavy runways for movement within the marsh. Through experiments involving transplanting the dominant plant, cordgrass (Spartina densiflora), and manipulating cavy presence in areas with and without ant mounds, we observed that cavies forage extensively (and defecate more) near ant mounds. The ants actively remove cavy droppings in their mound vicinity. These ant activities and interactions with cavy droppings led to reduced moisture and organic content while increasing nitrate and phosphate levels in marsh sediment. Consequently, this enhanced plant growth, indirectly facilitating the cavies, which preferred consuming vegetation near ant mounds. These cascading indirect effects persisted over time; even four months after cavies left the marshes, transplanted plants near ant mounds remained larger and exhibited more leaf senescence when exposed to cavy herbivory. Therefore, the networks of positive interactions appear to generate simultaneous selection among species (populations), promoting coexistence within the community. Although complex, these reciprocal facilitative effects among mobile animals may be more common than currently believed and should be further studied to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving species coexistence in natural communities.

AB  - The water buffalo faces challenges in optimizing nutrition due to varying local feed resources. In response to this challenge, the current study introduces originality by addressing the lack of region-specific feeding strategies for water buffaloes. This is achieved through the formulation of 30 different diets based on locally available resources, offering a tailored approach to enhance nutritional optimization in diverse agroecological contexts. These diets were segmented into three groups of ten, each catering to the maintenance (MD1 to MD10), growth (GD(1) to GD(10)), and lactation/production (PD1 to PD10) needs of buffaloes. Utilizing local feed ingredients, each diet was assessed for its chemical composition, in vitro gas and methane emissions, and dry matter (DM) disappearance using buffalo rumen liquor. The production diets (127 and 32.2 g/kg DM) had more protein and fats than the maintenance diets (82.0 and 21.0 g/kg DM). There was less (p < 0.05) fiber in the production diets compared to the maintenance ones. Different protein components (P-B1, P-B2) were lower (p < 0.05) in the maintenance diets compared to the growth and production ones, but other protein fractions (P-B3, P-c) were higher (p < 0.05) in the maintenance diet. Furthermore, the growth diets had the highest amount of other protein components (P-A), while the maintenance diets had the highest amount of soluble carbohydrates (586 g/kg DM), whereas the carbohydrate fraction (C-B1) was highest (p < 0.05) in the production diets (187 g/kg DM), followed by the growth (129 g/kg DM) and maintenance diets (96.1 g/kg DM). On the contrary, the carbohydrate C-A fraction was (p < 0.05) higher in the maintenance diets (107 g/kg DM) than in the growth (70.4 g/kg DM) and production diets (44.7 g/kg DM). The in vitro gas production over time (12, 24, and 48 h) was roughly the same for all the diets. Interestingly, certain components (ether extract, lignin, NDIN, ADIN, and P-B3 and C-C) of the diets seemed to reduce methane production, while others (OM, NPN, SP, P-A and P-B1,P- tCHO and C-B2) increased it. In simple words, this study reveals that different diets affect gas production during digestion, signifying a significant step towards a promising future for buffalo farming through tailored, region-specific formulations.

AB  - As detected in warming and ocean acidification, global change can have profound impact on marine life. Its effects on seagrasses are becoming increasingly well-known, since several studies have focused on the responses of these species to global change conditions. However a few studies have assessed the combined effect of temperature and acidification on seagrasses. Overall in this study, the combined effects of increased ocean temperature and pH levels expected at the end of this century (+5 degrees C and pH 7.5) on Cymodocea nodosa from Canary Islands, were evaluated for one month through manipulative laboratory experiments. Growth, net production, respiration, gross primary production, chlorophyll-a concentration and its vulnerability to herbivory were quantified. Results showed a positive effect of decreased pH on growth and gross primary production, as well as greater vulnerability to consumption by the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. In contrast, increased temperature limited net and gross primary production. This study shows than in future scenarios, C. nodosa from the Canary Islands may be a losing species in the global change stakes.

AB  - Seasonal migration is a behavioral response to predictable variation in environmental resources, risks, and conditions. In behaviorally plastic migrants, migration is a conditional strategy that depends, in part, on an individual's informational state. The cognitive processes that underlie how facultative migrants understand and respond to their environment are not well understood. We compared perception of the present environment to memory and omniscience as competing cognitive mechanisms driving altitudinal migratory decisions in an endangered ungulate, the Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis sierrae) using 1,298 animal years of data, encompassing 460 unique individuals. We built a suite of statistical models to partition variation in fall migratory status explained by cognitive predictors, while controlling for non-cognitive drivers. To approximate attribute memory, we included lagged attributes of the range an individual experienced in the previous year. We quantified perception by limiting an individual's knowledge of migratory range to the area and attributes visible from its summer range, prior to migrating. Our results show that perception, in addition to the migratory propensity of an individual's social group, and an individual's migratory history are the best predictors of migration in our system. Our findings suggest that short-distance altitudinal migration is, in part, a response to an individual's perception of conditions on alterative winter range. In long-distance partial migrants, exploration of migratory decision-making has been limited, but it is unlikely that migratory decisions would be based on sensory cues from a remote target range. Differing cognitive mechanisms underpinning short and long-distance migratory decisions will result in differing levels of behavioral plasticity in response to global climate change and anthropogenic disturbance, with important implications for management and conservation of migratory species.

AB  - Biotic interactions are key processes that strongly affect the performance of seedlings in plant communities. In this work, we evaluated the effect of grazing and shrubs on the emergence and establishment of seedlings with different life-forms (dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous) in a sub-humid grassland community. We delimited five areas of 25 m2 in which we established four permanent plots of 1.0 m2. Two plots were centered at shrubs (beneath the canopy) and two in open spaces (without shrubs). Half of the shrubs and open plots were fenced to avoid grazing. During two consecutive years we marked all emerged seedlings and followed their fate. Grazing promoted dicotyledonous seedling emergence but reduced establishment. On the contrary, shrubs reduced dicotyledonous emergence but enhanced establishment. We did not detect any effect of shrubs or grazing on the emergence of monocotyledonous seedlings. Most seedlings emerged during fall and winter and died during spring and summer. Recruitment from seeds in this grassland is rare and complex, involving biotic and abiotic factors, with different responses to grazing and shrubs depending on seedling life-form and ontogeny.

AB  - Context. Migratory populations of bogong moths in Australia are in decline. Numbers decreased after European settlement in the 1800s, and were stable before declining again from about 1980. Numerous hypothesised drivers for the decline have been postulated, and Caughley's declining population paradigm provides a systematic approach to diagnosing which of these are important, and hence the knowledge to guide recovery actions. Aims. This paper aims to assess which of the hypothesised drivers remain as candidate hypotheses for further investigation.Methods. Within the context of known bogong moth life history and the timing of observed declines, hypothesised drivers of the two decline phases were assessed with respect to their potential impact on larval recruitment and adult survival during migration and aestivation.Key results. Changes in vegetation composition and availability arising from the spread of pastoralism stand out as a likely driver of the early decline, with the herbivorous moth larva facing competition with introduced livestock, feral herbivores, and increased densities of native macropods. Many of the numerous postulated drivers of the most recent decline (e.g. changes in rainfall, rising temperatures in aestivation sites, increasing fire frequency) appear to have little support to be retained. Postulated drivers that remain as working hypotheses include increasing soil temperatures, increased cropping areas, and changed cropping practices and area. The effect of some drivers, such as artificial light pollution, is unclear and may warrant further investigation.Conclusions. Inference on the drivers of bogong moth population decline is wanting.Implications. Designed experiments are needed.

AB  - In biogeography the competitive exclusion principle (CEP) has been confirmed in some cases but not in others. This has fueled an unresolved debate between those advocating niche theory or the neutral theory in biodiversity and biogeography. We suggest that this situation mainly arises from the use of crisp logic, where the CEP is defined as either completely true or false. We propose the application of the fuzzy concepts of favorability (the degree to which environmental conditions are propitious for the occurrence of individual species) and favorableness (the degree to which environmental conditions are simultaneously favorable for competing species) to operationalize a fuzzy version of the CEP. Favorability was obtained by performing species distribution models applying favorability functions, while favorableness was derived from the application of the fuzzy intersection between the favorability for competing species. Then we plotted individual favorability values along the gradient of favorableness. Two potentially competing species would coexist in high-favorableness locations, as the demands of both species would be well fulfilled. In locations of low favorableness, the result would be either autecological exclusion of both species or autecological segregation, as abiotic conditions are unfavorable for at least one of the species. Competitive exclusion would occur at the intermediate stretch of the favorableness gradient, as the conditions would be good enough for persistence of each species separately but not enough for permanent coexistence. According to this theoretical framework, the observed probability that a location belongs to the intermediate favorableness area given that the two species co-occur in this location should be lower than expected according to the environmental probability models for the two species. We tested this prediction on published data about the distribution of pairs of native and introduced deer species in Great Britain, using a Bayesian approach. In two thirds of comparisons between a native and an introduced deer species the predictions of the fuzzy CEP were corroborated, which suggests that these are the pairs of species and the specific geographical areas affected by competitive exclusion. This is important both theoretically and for biodiversity conservation planning.

AB  - Background The wild boar (Sus scrofa) was extinct in Sweden when a few animals established in the 1970s. Over the past 35 years, the species has made a substantial comeback. In this paper, we analyse wild boar population growth using three indices of population size. We also map the legislative decisions and research prompted by the expanding population. We discuss to what extent, in the eyes of the state, the view of wild boar and the management focus has shifted over time, from a perceived pest (eradication) to scarce (conservation), overabundant (reduction/control) or somewhere in between (sustainable management). Results Wild boar harvest started in the early 1990s with a few hundred animals annually and peaked at 161,000 in 2020/2021. The distribution now comprises most of southern Sweden. Analyses of harvest and traffic accidents involving wild boar showed that the population grew exponentially until 2010/2011, after which the increase levelled off. Thus, logistic growth models showed the best fit for the full study period. We recorded 38 legislative decisions or commissions to government agencies regarding wild boar. The first decision in 1981 was to eradicate the free-ranging population. In 1987 however, the parliament decided that wild boar is native to Sweden and should be allowed in restricted extent. Later decisions mainly concerned hunting regulations and hunting methods as direct means to increase harvest and regulate the population. Another topic, increasing in importance over time, was to facilitate the use of wild boar meat to indirectly stimulate harvest. A local outbreak of African swine fever in 2023 necessitated a stamping out strategy in the affected area. We found 44 scientific papers regarding the present free-ranging population. Topics include movements and feeding patterns, hunting, reproduction, and population development. Conclusions The state historically regarded wild boar as a pest to be eradicated. This changed with the decision that wild boar should be allowed in restricted extent, suggesting a conservation approach. In response to population growth, the focus shifted to means facilitating sustainable management and, lately, reducing growth. The story of wild boar in Sweden illustrates attempts to mitigate conflicts and balance interests in wildlife management.

AB  - The 1983-1984 die-off of the long-spined sea urchin Diadema antillarum stands out as a catastrophic marine event because of its detrimental effects on Caribbean coral reefs. Without the grazing activities of this key herbivore, turf and macroalgae became the dominant benthic group, inhibiting coral recruitment and compromising coral reef recovery from other disturbances. In the decades that followed, recovery of D. antillarum populations was slow to non-existent. In late January 2022, a new mass mortality of D. antillarum was first observed in the U.S. Virgin Islands. We documented the spread and extent of this new die-off using an online survey. Infected individuals were closely monitored in the lab to record signs of illness, while a large population on Saba, Dutch Caribbean, was surveyed weekly before and during mortality to determine the lethality of this event. Within four months the die-off was distributed over 1,300 km from north to south and 2,500 km east to west. Whereas the 1983-1984 die-off advanced mostly with the currents, the 2022 event has appeared far more quickly in geographically distant areas. First die-off observations in each jurisdiction were often close to harbor areas, which, together with their rapid appearance, suggests that anthropogenic factors may have contributed to the spread of the causative agent. The signs of illness in sick D. antillarum were very similar to those recorded during the 1983-1984 die-off: lack of tube feet control, slow spine reaction followed by their loss, and necrosis of the epidermis were observed in both lab and wild urchins. Affected populations succumbed fast; within a month of the first signs of illness, a closely monitored population at Saba, Dutch Caribbean, had decreased from 4.05 individuals per m(2) to 0.05 individuals per m(2). Lethality can therefore be as high as 99%. The full extent of the 2022 D. antillarum die-off event is not currently known. The slower spread in the summer of 2022 might indicate that the die-off is coming to a (temporary) standstill. If this is the case, some populations will remain unaffected and potentially supply larvae to downstream areas and augment natural recovery processes. In addition, several D. antillarum rehabilitation approaches have been developed in the past decade and some are ready for large scale implementation. However, active conservation and restoration should not distract from the primary goal of identifying a cause and, if possible, implementing actions to decrease the likelihood of future D. antillarum die-off events.

AB  - The study tested an alternative method for the evaluation of habitat preferences of wisents (Bison bonasus) based upon possibly non-biased dataset - presence only data. Data on spatial distribution of free-ranging wisents (3055 individual presence records) were collected over a period of 10 years in the Bieszczady Mountains, south-eastern Poland. Using a nonparametric method of kernel estimators, the density of animal occurrence was calculated. The obtained dot map distribution allowed for spatial analyses of seasonal (winter and vegetative) presence that is related to environmental parameters such as the type of forest stand, dominating tree species, terrain and aspect. According to the final log-linear model, based upon presence-only data, significant differences exist in wisent seasonal preferences for habitat type. Wisents were more commonly found, in both winter and vegetative seasons, on sites with broken canopy closure (85.71% and 86.44%, respectively), as well as on slopes with steepness of 13-17o, with rate of presence of 89.83% and 91.84%, respectively. The most frequented tree association was alnus/pine irrespective of season. During both seasons, the percentage of records of wisent presence was the highest within sites of north aspect (93.22% in winter and 93.88% in vegetative), and on sloping terrain (94.92% and 93.88%, respectively), rather than within valleys or areas of relative flatness. The obtained results allow identification of conditions optimal for those animals unbiased by subjective evaluation of habitat conditions. This approach can be crucial in selecting sites potentially suitable for future reintroductions of wisents in the whole Carpathian range.

AB  - Plants have long-lasting and complex interactions with herbivores, including insects and mammals. In response to high herbivory rates, plants either tolerate biomass loss or develop several defence mechanisms, such as physical defence. The resource availability hypothesis (RAH) predicts that plant defence investment is dependent on resource availability and plant's life history. However, the effect of resource availability on plant investment in defence is mediated through biotic pressure. We tested the effects of soil qualities and browsing pressure on the physical defence and reproductive investments in Acacia sieberiana at the Pendjari Biosphere Reserve in West Africa. We selected six populations, including three in the Pendjari River floodplain where soil moisture is high but with high elephant browsing pressure, and three populations on the plateau in the hunting zone where soils are drier and relatively poorer with a lower density of elephants. We found greater investment in physical defence for trees in the floodplain. Furthermore, A. sieberiana trees produced less fruit in the floodplain than in the plateau. Contrary to the predictions of the RAH, we found more and longer thorns in populations in the richer floodplains than on the plateau. This was linked to higher elephant browsing pressure in the floodplains. This physical defence was probably induced to cope with the episodic but high levels of herbivory observed in this environment. Surprisingly, the negative influence of thorn number and size on the likelihood of elephant damage was observed only in the rich floodplains and not in plateau sites. Altogether, our study demonstrates that the influence of resource availability (soil moisture, pH, and fertility) in shaping plant physical defence can be outweighed by high herbivory pressure.
   Plants defend themselves from herbivores using features like thorns. According to the resource availability hypothesis, a plant's defenses depend on soil quality and its life cycle. We studied Acacia sieberiana in West Africa's Pendjari Biosphere Reserve, comparing two areas: fertile floodplains with many elephants and drier plateaus with fewer elephants. Surprisingly, trees in the richer floodplains had more and longer thorns but fewer fruits. This suggests that high herbivore pressure, rather than just soil quality, influences plant defense. Interestingly, thorns helped reduce elephant damage only in the floodplain. Our study shows that herbivore pressure can be more important than soil quality in shaping plant defense strategies.

AB  - Context. Distribution and abundance of the three northern Australian tree-rat species, Conilurus penicillatus, Mesembriomys macrurus and M. gouldii, have contracted significantly since European settlement. All three species were recorded from the Mitchell Plateau, Western Australia, in the 1980s, enabling their niche separation to be assessed. Despite this study being conducted in 1987, the results remain relevant for conservation strategies for these species. Aims. To determine the ecological separation among three tropical tree-rat species by documenting habitat preferences, habitat use and diet. Methods Live-trapping, radiotracking and spotlighting were used to assess relative abundance, habitat preference and movements of each species at nine sites on the Mitchell Plateau. Diet was determined using scat analysis; vegetation communities were described and characterised by pattern analysis. Key results. C. penicillatus (number of individuals trapped (n) = 24) was most abundant, followed by M. macrurus (n = 8) and M. gouldii (n = 2). Mature open forest with a well-developed understorey was preferred by the predominantly arboreal M. gouldii (1 site), M. macrurus occupied more varied habitats (four sites), especially ecotones between vine thicket and open eucalypt forest and the boulder edges of the plateau, and C. penicillatus occupied the greatest variety of habitats (four sites) in open eucalypt woodland with a diverse shrub layer and ground cover almost absent to very dense, tall grass. Diet analysis identified M. gouldii as a frugivore (fruits, some flowers), M. macrurus as an omnivore (seeds, fruits, flowers, termites, other invertebrates), and C. penicillatus as a generalist (monocot and dicot leaves, seeds, flowers, fruits, some arthropods). Conclusions. The largest of the species, M. gouldii, appeared to have the narrowest ecological niche, preferring more stable, structurally diverse, mature open forest that is infrequently burnt. The mid-sized M. macrurus occupies a broader range of habitats, particularly ecotones between vine thickets and eucalypt forest/woodland and woodland. C. penicillatus preferred open eucalypt woodland with a variable understorey. Implications. With a changing climate, increased fire frequency, habitat degradation by introduced herbivores and predation by cats across the tropical savanna distribution of these threatened tree-rats, this study provides data to underpin actions that may ensure their survival.

AB  - There are increasing concerns about the declining population trends of small mammalian carnivores around the world. Their conservation and management are often challenging due to limited knowledge about their ecology and natural history. To address one of these deficiencies for western spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis), we investigated their diet in the Oregon Cascades of the Pacific Northwest during 2017-2019. We collected 130 spotted skunk scats opportunistically and with detection dog teams and identified prey items using DNA metabarcoding and mechanical sorting. Western spotted skunk diet consisted of invertebrates, such as wasps, millipedes, and gastropods; vertebrates, such as small mammals, amphibians, and birds; and plants, such as Gaultheria, Rubus, and Vaccinium. Diet also consisted of items, such as black-tailed deer, that were likely scavenged. Comparison in diet by season revealed that spotted skunks consumed more insects during the dry season (June-August), particularly wasps (75% of scats in the dry season), and marginally more mammals during the wet season (September-May). We observed a similar diet in areas with no record of human disturbance and areas with a history of logging at most spatial scales, but scats collected in areas with older forest within a skunk's home range (1-km buffer) were more likely to contain insects. Western spotted skunks provide food web linkages between aquatic, terrestrial, and arboreal systems and serve functional roles of seed dispersal and scavenging. Due to their diverse diet and prey switching, western spotted skunks may dampen the effects of irruptions of prey, such as wasps, during dry springs and summers. By studying the natural history of western spotted skunks in the Pacific Northwest forests, while they are still abundant, we provide key information necessary to achieve the conservation goal of keeping this common species common.

AB  - Installation of feral pig (Sus scrofa) exclusion fences to conserve and rehabilitate coastal floodplain habitat for fish production and water quality services remains untested. Twenty-one floodplain and riverine wetlands in the Archer River catchment (north Queensland) were surveyed during postwet (June-August) and late-dry season (November-December) in 2016, 2017, and 2018, using a fyke net soaked overnight (similar to 14-15 hr) to test: (a) whether the fish assemblage are similar in wetlands with and without fences; and (b) whether specific environmental conditions influence fish composition between fenced and unfenced wetlands. A total of 6,353 fish representing twenty-six species from 15 families were captured. There were no wetland differences in fish assemblages across seasons, years and for fenced and unfenced (PERMANOVA, Pseudo-F < 0.589, p < .84). Interestingly, the late-dry season fish were far smaller compared to postwet season fish: a strategy presumably in place to maximize rapid disposal following rain and floodplain connectivity. In each wetland, a calibrated Hydrolab was deployed (between 2 and 4 days, with 20 min logging) in the epilimnion (0.2 m) and revealed distinct diel water quality cycling of temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH (conductivity represented freshwater wetlands), which was more obvious in the late-dry season survey because of extreme summer conditions. Water quality varied among wetlands in terms of the daily amplitude and extent of daily photosynthesis recovery, which highlights the need to consider local conditions and that applying general assumptions around water quality conditions for these types of wetlands is problematic for managers. Though many fish access wetlands during wet season connection, the seasonal effect of reduced water level conditions seems more overimprovised when compared to whether fences are installed, as all wetlands supported few, juvenile, or no fish species because they had dried completely regardless of the presence of fences.

AB  - Moonlight structures activity patterns of many nocturnal species. Bright moonlight often limits the activity of nocturnal prey, but dense vegetation weakens this effect. Using 8 years of live-trapping data, we asked whether reintroduced megaherbivores (Bison bison) indirectly altered moonlight avoidance by small mammals in tallgrass prairies. In plots with bison, plants intercepted 20% less light, allowing more moonlight to reach ground level. During nights with no moonlight, Peromyscus maniculatus activity was similar in plots with and without bison. During nights with peak moonlight, P. maniculatus activity was four times greater in plots without bison compared to plots with bison. Conversely, Microtus ochrogaster activity was twice as great during full moons compared to new moons, but only in plots with bison. We also equipped a subset of traps with temperature sensors to estimate trap-entry time. Although M. ochrogaster was more active on bright nights, most activity occurred before moonrise or after moonset, avoiding periods of bright moonlight. We conclude that megaherbivores play an unappreciated but important indirect role in tallgrass prairies by inducing behavioral shifts in other animal species. Because overlap in activity patterns can predict the likelihood of predator-prey encounters, such activity shifts have important implications for trophic interactions throughout restored prairie food webs. Additional work to understand interspecific and intraspecific variation in response to moonlight may improve efforts to forecast changes in community assembly due to restoration and land-use change.

AB  - Blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) are among the first insects to arrive on a corpse, and so they are particularly important in forensic entomology. To use blow flies in forensic investigations, there must be information available on their species diversity, abundance, and distribution in the areas where investigations are conducted. Several factors can contribute to species distribution, and elevation is one of those factors. The purpose of this study was to document the distribution of Calliphoridae across four elevational gradients in Sicily and Ecuador, where little information is available. Baited traps were placed at elevations ranging from 20 m to 1552 m in Sicily (a major island and region of Italy and a distinct ecoregion) and 561 m to 3336 m in Ecuador. Species richness, relative abundance, and diversity were calculated, as well as the ratio of female to male blow flies and community assemblage. Twelve species were collected in Sicily, and seventeen species were collected in Ecuador. In Sicily, the most abundant species was Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (68.50% of the total capture), while in Ecuador, it was Compsomyiops verena (Walker) (51.67% of the total capture). In Sicily, significant differences were only observed in the relative abundance of L. sericata across elevations. In Ecuador, significant differences were observed in the relative abundance of Calliphora nigribasis (Macquart), Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann), C. verena, Hemilucilia semidiaphana (Rondani), Lucilia ibis (Shannon), L. purpurascens (Walker), and Paralucilia sp. across elevations. These data can help build a checklist of blow fly species in these two regions and can be instrumental in environmental and forensic investigations.

AB  - Marine protected area (MPA) designs, including large-scale MPAs (LSMPAs; > 150,000 km2), mobile MPAs (fluid spatiotemporal boundaries), and MPA networks, may offer different benefits to species and could enhance protection by encompassing spatiotemporal scales of animal movement. We sought to understand how well LSMPAs could benefit nine highly-mobile marine species in the tropics now and into the future by: 1) evaluating current range overlap within a LSMPA; 2) evaluating range overlap under climate change projections; and 3) evaluating how well theoretical MPA designs benefit these nine species. We focused on Palmyra Atoll and Kingman Reef, a 2000 km(2) area within the 1.2 million km(2) U.S. Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument (PRIMNM) that contains marine megafauna (reef and pelagic fishes; sea turtles; seabirds; cetaceans) reflecting different behaviors and habitat use. Our approach is useful for evaluating the effectiveness of the Palmyra-Kingman MPA and PRIMNM in protecting these species, and tropical LSMPAs in general, and for informing future MPA design. Stationary MPAs provided protection at varying scales. Reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi), grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas), and bottlenose dolphins (Tur-siops truncatus) had overall small ranges (< 100 km from Palmyra-Kingman) and could benefit from stationary MPAs that contained heterogenous reef habitats. Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), sooty terns (Onychoprion fuscatus), red-footed boobies (Sula sula), great frigatebirds (Fregata minor), and melon-headed whales (Peponocephala electra) navigated complex oceanographic processes and may benefit most from mobile MPAs that shift with features including thermal fronts, cyclic regions of elevated productivity, and eddies, if relationships with these features are established and predictable. All species had capacity to travel to nearby reef systems, illustrating potential benefits of MPA networks and protected corridors. Suitable habitats will likely contract for all species as warm water expands under climate change scenarios (species habitats were predicted to decrease by 4-49% at Palmyra-Kingman) and MPAs may not protect suitable habitats into the future. Species habitat requirements and movement ecologies are critical aspects of marine spatial planning, especially with respect to dynamic ocean processes and a changing climate.

AB  - Breeding outcome in birds can be influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, which may contribute differentially to each stage of the breeding cycle. Island raptors are relatively threatened species that rely on simplified food webs and usually co-occur with invasive species. Here, we studied a population of Striated Caracara Phalcoboenus australis in Isla de los Estados (Argentina) to understand the relative contribution of food availability, topographical features and territoriality to breeding parameters. Caracaras in the area depend on the short seasonal (i.e. pulsed) availability of seabirds for feeding their chicks. On the other hand, the recent introduction of non-native ungulates may have led to a suboptimal breeding environment by reducing Caracara nest-site availability within the seabird colonies via disturbance of the grassland. Using data from seven breeding seasons we analyse the abundance, the proportion of breeding individuals, the spatial structure of breeding events and the population-level breeding performance, including chick sex ratio, to study whether the breeding ecology of this species is still shaped by marine food web pulses or could be associated with invasive herbivore disturbance. The breeding adults represented only 6-15% of the population. The spatial pattern of nest-sites did not differ from random arrangement after considering the heterogeneous distribution of food availability. Territory identity accounted for most of the variation in clutch size and productivity, and penguin availability explained part of the variability in territory occupancy and hatching rate. The chick sex ratio was biased towards females and varied according to brood size, with the more productive territories producing 91% of males. The breeding cycle of this population is still mainly dependent upon the Rockhopper Penguin Eudyptes chrysocome food pulse and presents mixed evidence of being disrupted by invasive herbivores. The studied factors contributed differentially to the output of each reproductive stage, with territory identity accounting for most of the variation. Our results suggest that individual-level, long-term data could be relevant to understanding the dynamics of this species in the Fuegian archipelago, and thus a broad-scale research programme is warranted to assess the conservation status and propose future management scenarios for this species.

AB  - Understanding the changes in population size, distribution and threats, is essential for assessing the status of threatened species. Northern China is believed to be an important stronghold for the Near Threatened Asiatic wild ass or khulan (Equus hemionus), but a recent assessment of the species has been lacking. To document change and updated the current status of khulan in China, we conducted a literature review targeting peer-reviewed and grey literature, newspaper articles, and summarized the results own field surveys and interviews from part of the species range. For a better understanding of the threats to khulan in China, we summarized the results of studies on environmental habitat factors and human disturbances for khulan, most of which are only available in Chinese language. Our results suggest that khulan in China have experienced a dramatic decline and fragmentation of their distribution range caused by excessive anthropogenic interferences. The remaining khulan range in China covers probably less than 40,000 km2 and is scattered over several nature reserves and the border areas in northern Xinjiang, northwestern Gansu, and western Inner Mongolia. We estimate the remaining population at about 4000 individuals, with ~80% found in Kalamaili Mountain Ungulate National Nature Reserve in Xinjiang. The occurrences along the border with Mongolia are small and dependent on cross-border movements, which are currently severely hindered by border fences. Over the past 15 years, Kalamaili Mountain Ungulate National Nature Reserve was exposed to various human pressures and experienced dramatic population fluctuation in the khulan population size. Key factors which negatively influenced khulan were habitat loss, fragmentation, and disturbance due to mining exploration and infrastructure development. No systematic monitoring of khulan is done in the rest of the khulan range, but whereas illegal hunting seems no longer a serious threat, infrastructure development and land use changes (including increasing livestock numbers) are happening throughout the remaining range of khulan in China. Hence there is an urgent need to develop a national khulan conservation strategy and initiate cross-border cooperation with Mongolia to safeguard the long-term survival of the species in the Gobi region.

AB  - Amid intensive transformations in the Arctic environment and biota, differences in population trends demonstrated by predominant and widespread Arctic herbivores are of great scientific interest. In this regard, the primary purpose of this study was to perform a comparative assessment of trophic selectivity in the barnacle goose and greater white-fronted goose in the area of their highest reproductive concentrations and estimate the role of competition in their population dynamics. The data indicate that differences in quantitative shares of plants consumed by these species are not sufficient to avoid competition and that the diet of barnacle geese is more selective (i.e., sensitive to food quality and energy consumption). However, the status of a relatively weak competitor contradicts the exponential growth of the barnacle goose population in the study area, as well as its entire Arctic population. We believe that differences in the population dynamics of barnacle goose and greater white-fronted goose are currently determined not by competition in reproductive concentration periods, but by effects exercised by anthropogenic and climatic factors far outside of their nesting range.

AB  - In the Archipelago Sea as in most other parts of the Baltic Sea, the bladder wrack (Fucus vesiculosus) is a foundation species of the littoral communities of the rocky shores. It sustains a community of epiphytic algae, herbivorous crustaceans and molluscs and var-ious fish. Recently we have noticed a steep decline in the occurrence of the herbivorous crustaceans and molluscs in many sites in the Archipelago Sea. We hypothesise that a key factor contributing to this decline is the recent introduction of the Harris mud crab (Rhithropanopeus harrisii), which was first sighted in 2009 in this region. Importantly, because there are no native crabs in the northern parts of the Baltic Sea, the mud crab is a completely novel kind of predator in the ecosystem and the herbivorous crustaceans and molluscs may be particularly susceptible to it. Here, we document a dramatic de-cline of the typical herbivores occurring on the bladder wrack, possibly indicating an ongoing regime shift, by comparing our recent samples from across the Archipelago Sea with data collected a decade before the sighting of the mud crab. Moreover, we demonstrate a spatio-temporal association between the decline, particularly of the key herbivore species, the isopod Idotea balthica, and the establishment of the mud crab. We also present experimental evidence for a strong predator-prey-link between the mud crab and the isopod I. balthica. Finally, we discuss the possible consequences of the community change and scrutinise alternative explanations for our observations.

AB  - Eutrophication resulting from anthropogenic activities has been recognized as a significant driver of changes in ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, it may exacerbate the top-down effect and thus exert an important impact on plant growth. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a 3-year manipulative field experiment to investigate the impacts of nitrogen addition and crab herbivory on the growth of Phragmites australis in the salt marsh of the Yellow River Delta. The results demonstrated that a 3-year nitrogen addition can significantly increase the total nitrogen and carbon content of P. australis leaves, thereby enhancing their nutritional value and palatability, as well as increasing the proportion of leaves consumed by crabs. Therefore, nitrogen addition together with crab herbivory had a significant negative effect on P. australis height, leaf length, and leaf breadth in the ambient crab and procedural crab cage treatment compared to the crab exclusion treatment. The structural equation modeling further substantiated these findings. The model revealed a direct and positive correlation between nitrogen addition and leaf nutrient content (path coefficient = 0.34). Additionally, it demonstrated a direct and positive relationship between leaf nutrient content and the proportion of leaves consumed by crabs (path coefficient = 0.22). Simultaneously, there was an observed negative correlation (path coefficient = - 0.37) between the proportion of leaves consumed by crabs and plant functional traits, represented by leaf length in the model, during 2018. Moreover, the crab exclusion treatment significantly reduced the proportion of leaves consumed by crabs and thus enhanced the P. australis individuals, leaf number, and biomass. Overall, crab herbivory had a significant detrimental top-down effect on the growth of P. australis, and nitrogen enrichment may exacerbate this top-down effect. The findings of our study highlight the combined adverse effects of nutrient enrichment and top-down on plant functional traits and plant growth. The findings of this study will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the underlying factors influencing vegetation degradation in coastal wetland, thereby establishing a solid theoretical framework for the conservation and management of wetland ecosystems within the context of global environmental change.

AB  - A Macrozone is a socioecological region with shared geographic and demographic characteristics. Within the Chilean Austral Macrozone (43 degrees to 56 degrees SL), the native temperate forests serve as a crucial resource, offering multiple ecosystem services to local communities. These forests significantly support animal husbandry practices involving cattle, horses and sheep. However, introducing these exotic species affects natural regeneration and compromises their long-term sustainability. This study proposes a new classification of the temperate forests in the Chilean Austral Macrozone based on structure parameters and determine their relationships with animal husbandry and natural regeneration. Data were obtained from Chile's National Forest Inventory (NFI) (2001-2010), including 195 inventory plots (500 m(2)) with 21 tree species. We redefined the forest categories described in NFI according to the proportional basal area of each tree species at each plot. We used two levels of analysis: forest composition (Level 1), which includes general categories such as mono-specific (dominated by a single tree species), bi-specific (dominated by two tree species), and multi-specific forests (dominated by multiple tree species), and forest type (Level 2), which includes specific species (e.g., Nothofagus pumilio) or species groups (e.g., N. pumilio - N. dombeyi) with economic relevance. We evaluated the data using univariate and multivariate analyses. We found 18 forest types in the Austral Macrozone, in contrast to the three traditionally recognized forest types used in the NFI (e.g., lenga, evergreen, coihue de Magallanes). Livestock was observed in all forest types, where Nothofagus forests showed that regeneration in N. antarctica and N. pumilio were higher with livestock than without livestock breeding (Hedges' g > 0.51). The natural regeneration of the studied forests was influenced by animal husbandry, environmental variables (bioclimatic and topographic factors), and forest structure. Our data suggested the importance of using more forest types than the three classics to generate tools or recommendations that are more focused on the particularities of each one. The classification must be based on forest parameters obtained during NFI. The proposed forest type classification reflects the complexity and richness of the forests in a better way, which could improve forest management and the development of public policies related to climate change and sustainability. Finally, although livestock pressure was observed in all forest types, the impact over some areas (e.g., N. antarctica) needs special attention in the forest management and conservation planning for the Chilean Austral Macrozone.

AB  - We analysed the possibility of reintroducing the European bison (Bison bonasus L.) in the north of Romania-in Suceava, Neamt,, and Maramures, counties-as well as increasing the wild European bison population in Neamt, county to improve the genetic quality of the existing population. Currently, there is a population of over 50 individuals in the wild in Vanatori Neamt, Natural Park, Romania. At the same time, an attempt was made to identify the connecting corridors between the free European bison in Neamt, county and other populations through new nuclei of European bison released in Suceava and Maramures, counties. In this regard, the hunting grounds with the highest ecological potential for the analysed species were identified using GIS spatial analysis techniques. The aim was also to trace possible ecological corridors linking different reintroduction locations, taking into account the ecological claims of the species. The analysis also followed the size of the European bison groups to be released, the sex ratio of each group, and the periodicity of their releasing. In order to reach viable populations, scenarios and simulations were carried out depending on the age, number, and sex of the relocated specimens. In this regard, the dynamics and the minimum viable population that could survive without risk of extinction were highlighted. The analysis showed that the analysed area has a high potential for the reintroduction of European bison in the wild. The release and creation of new European bison nuclei in the wild creates the premises for natural contacts with the existing free populations in the wild, genetic improvement, and increasing fauna diversity with ecological, social, and economic implications.

AB  - Cameroon Blackbelly sheep are a domestic breed of hair sheep from West/Central Africa. They are popular with small-holder farmers in Cameroon as they are highly resilient to local environmental challenges and are prolific a-seasonal breeders. The aim of this study was to characterise the genetics of Cameroon Blackbelly sheep in relation to global sheep populations and to investigate their relationship to Caribbean hair sheep. We first examined the genetic diversity of the Cameroon Blackbelly breed relative to global sheep populations using 50K SNP data. We also used whole genome sequence data to further investigate relationships between Cameroon Blackbelly and breeds from Africa and Europe, as well as the Barbados Blackbelly breed from the Caribbean, which is phenotypically similar to Cameroon Blackbelly. ADMIXTURE results based on 50K and WGS data demonstrated both West/Central African and European ancestries for the Barbados Blackbelly sheep. Results from f4-statistics-based qpAdm analyses supported these findings. Local ancestry inference identified several genomic regions in Barbados Blackbelly with high proportions of West/Central African ancestry. One of these, on OAR3, includes various keratin genes, suggesting that these genes may play a role in the shared coat phenotypes of the Barbados Blackbelly and Cameroon Blackbelly. This result is consistent with previous reports of adaptive introgression of coat characteristics in both wild and domesticated species. The findings of our study support the view that sheep were transported from West/Central Africa to the Caribbean as part of the transatlantic slave trade and European colonisation, similar to introductions proposed for cattle and goats.

AB  - Controlling persistent infectious disease in wildlife populations is an ongoing challenge for wildlife managers and conservationists worldwide, and chronic diseases in particular remain a pernicious problem. Here, we develop a dynamic pathogen transmission model capturing key features of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae infection, a major cause of population declines in North American bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis. We explore the effects of model assumptions and parameter values on disease dynamics, including density- versus frequency-dependent transmission, the inclusion of a carrier class versus a longer infectious period, host survival rates, disease-induced mortality and recovery rates and the epidemic growth rate. Along the way, we estimate the basic reproductive ratio, R-0, for M. ovipneumoniae in bighorn sheep to fall between approximately 1.36 and 1.74. We apply the model to compare efficacies across a suite of management actions following an epidemic, including test-and-remove, depopulation-and-reintroduction, range expansion, herd augmentation and density reduction. Our results suggest that test-and-remove, depopulation-and-reintroduction and range expansion could help persistently infected bighorn sheep herds recovery following an epidemic. By contrast, augmentation could lead to worse outcomes than those expected in the absence of management. Other management actions that improve host survival or reduce disease-induced mortality are also likely to improve population size and persistence of chronically infected herds. Synthesis and applications. Dynamic transmission models like the one employed here offer a structured, logical approach for exploring hypotheses, planning field experiments and designing adaptive management. We find that management strategies that removed infected animals or isolated them within a structured metapopulation were most successful at facilitating herd recovery from a low-prevalence, chronic pathogen. Ideally, models like ours should operate iteratively with field experiments to triangulate on better approaches for managing wildlife diseases.

AB  - Insectivorous predators play a crucial role in suppressing herbivore populations and mitigating herbivory in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the outcomes of 'insectivore-herbivore-plant' interactions are context dependent. This study examines the effects of vertebrate insectivores (birds and bats) and carnivorous arthropods (spiders) on herbivorous insects (caterpillars and sap suckers) and their host plant, Machilus thunbergii (Lauraceae), in a subtropical evergreen forest. We employed a factorial field experiment with four treatments: control (no exclusion), bird/bat exclusion, spider removal, and bird/bat exclusion plus spider removal. Forty trees (10 per treatment) were surveyed for herbivore abundance, degree of herbivory, and herbivore community composition. The results indicate that the predator treatments had no effects on sap suckers or sap-sucking damage. However, compared to the control, the leaf-chewing damage was higher in the bird/bat exclusion plus spider removal treatment, accompanied by shifts in leaf-chewer community composition and a trend toward increased leaf-chewer abundance. Spider abundance was lower in the control than in the bird/bat exclusion treatment, suggesting intraguild predation of spiders by birds and bats. Nevertheless, the leaf-chewing damage remained similar between these treatments, indicating that intraguild predation did not weaken the trophic cascade. This study is one of the few experiments that manipulate both vertebrate insectivores and carnivorous arthropods, and provides rare evidence that these two predator groups can perform complementary roles in suppressing herbivory. Our findings suggest that the strength of trophic interactions in the 'insectivore-leaf chewer-plant' system of this subtropical evergreen forest are likely to be relatively stable.

AB  - For millennia, the coastal heathlands of Western Europe were managed by regular burning cycles for improved grazing. In recent decades, this practice has generally been neglected. In Norway, the result is accumulation of degenerated heather and highly combustible Juniperus communis (juniper) encroachment, i.e., an increasing fire threat to a rising number of homes in the wildland-urban interface (WUI). In the present study, goats grazing a 1.2 ha site partly encroached by fire-prone juniper were studied in a living lab approach. Twelve wethers (castrated male goats) wearing solar-powered Nofence GPS collars were virtually fenced to protect villa gardens bordering the site during eight weeks from 18 April 2022. Besides some early operator errors, tree shadows and cloudy days limiting battery charging, the system worked well. Photographs taken prior to and after the grazing revealed that only 39% of the junipers had 90+% remaining foliage while for 41%, the foliage was reduced to below 10%, making them far less fire-prone. The goats were frequently visited by neighborhood residents of all ages, school classes, and kindergartens. Moreover, local newspapers and TV stations broadcasted the initiative. Although divided regarding debarked deciduous trees, the neighbors stated that the goats were well accepted. Despite some limited loss of garden plants, all interviewed residents bordering the site were positive about the goats "bringing life to the forest" and, if possible, welcomed them back for other grazing periods. Virtually fenced grazing goats may represent a sustainable solution for reducing fire hazards in the WUI also elsewhere.

AB  - A typical challenge in studies on habitat selection is the creation of a global model at a population level. We focus upon an aspect frequently neglected in studies on habitat preferences - individual variability resulting from the ecological plasticity of a species. We studied European bison (wisent) Bison bonasus, inhabiting Bialowieska Forest (north-eastern Poland), using data from GPS collars fitted on 11 individuals observed during 12-48 months, and demonstrated that habitat selection patterns in this population are highly variable. Even seasonal changes in habitat preference did not mitigate individual variability - during the same months, particular individuals of the same sex preferred certain habitats which were avoided by others. Therefore, even with fuzzy analysis, it was not possible to create clear rules for predicting habitat preferences for a given individual; only general patterns can be specified for seasonal avoidance of some habitats, rather than their positive selection. Hence, flexibility in habitat selection should be considered in planning the reintroduction of this species into new sites because it could considerably enhance the assumed available spectrum of suitable habitats. Moreover, since the natural dispersion of animals is not limited to forest complexes, new challenges for conservation as well as new limiting factors resulting from social conflicts could appear which should be taken into account in conservation planning, especially in agricultural areas.

AB  - Introduction Strategically managing livestock grazing in arid regions optimizes land use and reduces the damage caused by overgrazing. Controlled grazing preserves the grassland ecosystem and fosters sustainability despite resource limitations. However, uneven resource distribution can lead to diverse grazing patterns and land degradation, particularly in undulating terrains.Methods In this study, we developed a herbivore foraging algorithm based on a resource selection function model to analyze foraging distribution patterns, predict the probability of foraging, and identify the determinants of foraging probability in cattle. The study area was a complex desert landscape encompassing dunes and interdunes. Data on cattle movements and resource distribution were collected and analyzed to model and predict foraging behavior.Results Our findings revealed that cattle prefer areas with abundant vegetation in proximity to water sources and avoid higher elevations. However, abundant resource availability mitigated these impacts and enhanced the role of water points, particularly during late grazing periods. The analysis showed that available resources primarily determine foraging distribution patterns and lessen the effects of landforms and water distance on patch foraging.Discussion The results suggest that thoughtful water source placement and the subdivision of pastures into areas with varied terrain are crucial for sustainable grazing management. By strategically managing these factors, land degradation can be minimized, and the ecological balance of grassland ecosystems can be maintained. Further research is needed to refine the model and explore its applicability in other arid regions.

AB  - The Galician coast, with 1498 km of shoreline, is located in the northwest corner of the Iberian Peninsula. This area is the northern boundary of the Canary upwelling system, at the transition between the subtropical and subpolar regimes of the North Atlantic, which makes it of particular interest for the detection of marine ecosystem changes. Relationships between the occurrence of non-native marine fishes in this coastal area and sea surface temperature fluctuations are investigated. Information about fish species were collected from published and unpublished material recorded since 1945, and with regular monitoring data since 1983. A total of 50 new additions to the Galician marine ichthyofauna were recorded over the period 1945-2022. One of these species, Cynoscion regalis (Sciaenidae), is considered an introduced species. Most of the remaining 49 species are the result of latitudinal range expansions, including 15 species that have reached the northern limit of their distribution in the north-east Atlantic. This evidence points towards the tropicalization of the Galician fish fauna. Satellite sea-surface temperatures over the period 1982-2020 showed that Galician oceanic and coastal waters are, respectively, 0.78 +/- 0.01 degrees C and 0.32 +/- 0.01 degrees C warmer than 40 years ago. This ocean warming, added to the high productivity of the area and the oceanographic features, support the different ranges of expansion found in marine fishes, reinforcing the process of tropicalization. The increasing presence of new marine fishes in Galician waters could lead to relevant impacts on this ecosystem, like the emergence of new fish parasites and the increase of top predators and herbivorous fish among others.

AB  - In the Burwash area of north-central Ontario, Canada, expansion of the Trans-Canada highway from 2 to 4 lanes was accompanied by installation of a range of wildlife collision-mitigation infrastructure (e.g., exclusion fencing, underpasses). To assess the overall effectiveness of these measures, we monitored the spatial distribution and mortality rates of elk (Cervus canadensis) prior to and following highway expansion, distinguished by season (winter, snowfree) and corridor-type (highway, railway). We measured herd-level risk by the proportion of positions falling within 200-m railway and highway buffer zones using Bayesian methods. Spatial analysis confirmed that there was a distinct northward shift in the winter distribution of elk following construction, situating the elk past the north end of the exclusion fence. This increased the herd's exposure to highway traffic by 3.6 times (proportion of points before = 0.0041 +/- 0.002 [SE], after = 0.0147 +/- 0.003, P = 0.005), and resulted in a more than 2-fold increase in elk road mortality from 0.6 elk/yr/20 km during 8 years prior to implementation to 1.5 elk/yr/20 km during 8 years after implementation. Exposure to railways remained unchanged and consistently higher than highway exposure regardless of season (e.g., post-mitigation, winter proportion of points = 0.0453 +/- 0.005), matched by consistently high mortality counts (proportion of points before = 6.4 elk/yr/20 km, after = 6.6 elk/yr/20 km). Our results demonstrate that while wildlife-vehicle collision mitigation is generally beneficial to wildlife and humans, failure to account for the local characteristics of wildlife populations can lead to suboptimal mitigation designs that reduce their effectiveness and lead to unintended wildlife impacts.

AB  - Archaeological studies of pre-historic Arctic cultures are often limited to artefacts and architecture; such records may be incomplete and often do not provide a continuous record of past occupation. Here, we used lake sediment archives to supplement archaeological evidence to explore the history of Thule and Dorset populations on Somerset Island, Nunavut (Canada). We examined biomarkers in dated sediment cores from two ponds adjacent to abandoned Thule settlements (PaJs-3 and PaJs-13) and compared these to sediment cores from two ponds without past human occupation. Coprostanol and epicoprostanol, delta 15N measurements, sedimentary chlorophyll a and the ratio of diatom valves to chrysophyte cysts were elevated in the dated sediment profiles at both sites during Thule and Dorset occupations. Periods of pronounced human impact during the Thule occupation of the site were corroborated by 14C-dated caribou bones found at both sites that identified intense caribou hunting between ca 1185 and 1510 CE. Notably, these sediment core data show evidence of the Dorset occupation from ca 200 to 500 CE at sites where archaeological evidence was heretofore lacking. We highlight the utility of lake sediments in assisting archaeological studies to better establish the timings, peak occupations and even lifestyle practices of the Dorset and Thule Arctic peoples.

AB  - For decades, the hunting community has used solunar charts to predict activity to predict increased animal activity during daily lunar events (i.e., moonrise, moonset, moon underfoot, and moon overhead) and as the moon approaches a new or full phase, based on gravitational pull. Solunar charts are used by the general public, but research on the accuracy of these charts is limited. Our objective was to examine activity patterns, based on distance between location fixes, of male Deer in relation to the day-rating system used in solunar charts. In December-February of 2009 through 2011, we examined activity patterns of 22 GPS-collared adult male Deer at a high-fenced property in Alabama in relation to a solunar-chart rating system using a 1-4 scale (i.e., 1 being the lowest predicted activity and 4 the highest). We deemed a Deer active if the distance it travelled in the 15-minute span between location fixes was greater than our minimum-distance threshold of 51.78 m. For analysis, we used a generalized linear mixed-effects model with a binomial distribution (active or inactive) comparing Deer activity to a predicted window period and a solunarchart rating scale. We found that during the predicted movement periods of moonrise and moonset, Deer were 0.30 and 0.37 times more likely to be active on the highest rated day versus the lowest rated day, respectively. Whereas during the predicted movement periods of moon underfoot and overhead, Deer were 3.02 and 2.83 times more likely to be active on the highest-rated day versus the lowest-rated day, respectively. Furthermore, we found a decreasing probability of activity as day rating increased during moonrise and an increasing probability of activity as day rating increased during moon overhead and moon underfoot. During moonset we observed an increased probability of activity between day rating 1 and 2 but then a decreasing probability of activity as day rating increased to 3 and 4. This study supports prior findings that solunar charts show inconsistencies in predictions of Deer activon lunar events and phases. As a result, we cannot fully disregard the potential that Deer activity may vary during different periods of the lunar cycle. We believe these findings warrant further research examining lunar effects on activity patterns of Deer across different regions, sexes, and time of the year (i.e., breeding and non-breeding season).

AB  - Grazing can potentially affect grassland soil carbon storage through selective feeding, trampling and fecal excretion of livestock. The numerous case studies and a few meta-analyses have focused on grazing-induced changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, but the effects of grazing on SOC in major grassland types of China are not clear. In this study, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to identify the impact of grazing on soil carbon in China. We found that the key factors affecting the SOC content of grazing grasslands is grazing intensity. Heavy grazing (HG) significantly decreased the SOC content by 7.5 % in major grassland types of China (95 % confidence interval (CI), -11.43 % to -3.57 %, P < 0.001). The SOC content in temperate desert steppes (7.22 %), temperate meadow-steppes (10.89 %) under heavy grazing (HG) showed significantly (P < 0.05) decreased. HG resulted in significant (P < 0.01) decreases in SOC content (6.91 %) of Kastanoze. Our study highlighted that formulating rational grazing strategies according to grassland and soil types was the key to increasing SOC storage and sequestration under climate change and increased human pressure.

AB  - Although it is well recognized that the strength of plant-herbivore interactions can vary with the plant sex, the distance, and the density of conspecific neighbors, no study has yet assessed their combined influence. Here, we filled this knowledge gap by focusing on the dioecious palm Chamaeropshumilis L., and its two main herbivores, the invasive moth Paysandisiaarchon Burmeister and the feral goat Caprahircus L. We evaluated levels and spatial patterns of herbivory, as well as those of plant size and number of inflorescences in two palm populations in Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Spain). Our spatial point pattern analyses revealed that palms not affected by moth herbivory or goat florivory were spatially aggregated, goats fed more strongly upon inflorescences in palms with more neighbors, but they consumed more leaves in isolated palms. Interestingly, we could reveal for the first time that plant sex is a key plant trait modulating neighborhood effects. For instance, whereas aggregated female palms experienced lower intensity of goat florivory than isolated ones, male palms showed the opposite pattern. Palm size and number of inflorescences also showed sex-related differences, suggesting that sexual dimorphism is a key driver of the observed neighborhood effects on herbivory. Our study highlights the importance of considering relevant plant traits such as sex when investigating plant neighborhood effects, calling for further research to fully understand the dynamics governing plant-herbivore interactions in dioecious systems.

AB  - This study illustrates the contribution of plant and faecal microfossil records to interdisciplinary approaches on the identification, composition, taphonomy and seasonality of livestock dung materials. The focus is on the taphonomy of opal phytoliths and calcitic dung spherulites embedded within modern faecal pellets collected from pasture grounds and pens from a range of animals, including cattle, sheep and pigs from three different farms and seasons of the year in Menorca (Balearic Islands, Spain) declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO. Modern reference materials provide comparative plant and dung microfossil indicators on factors affecting the formation, composition, preservation and decay of animal faeces, as well as on the diverse environmental and anthropogenic aspects influencing these. The reported results show relevant changes in phytolith and spherulite composition according to animal species and age, livestock management, seasonality, and grazing and foddering regimes. Both microfossil records provide fundamental information on taphonomic issues that are understudied, such as the variation in the digestibility among different species, including under investigated animals such as pigs, as well on the seasonality of plant and faecal microfossils that are excreted with dung as an important material for reconstructing human-environment interactions which is commonly overlooked in archaeology.

AB  - Rhinolophus bats have been identified as natural reservoirs for viruses with global health implications, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) and swine acute diarrhoea syndrome-related coronavirus (SADSr-CoV). In this study, we characterised the individual viromes of 603 bats to systematically investigate the diversity, abundance and geographic distribution of viral communities within R. affinis, R. sinicus and 11 other bat species. The massive metatranscriptomic data revealed substantial viral genome resources of 133 vertebrate-infecting viral clusters, which contain occasional cross-species transmission across mammalian orders and especially across bat families. Notably, those viruses included nine clusters closely related to human and/or livestock pathogens, such as SARS-CoVs and SADS-CoVs. The investigation also highlighted distinct features of viral diversity between and within bat colonies, which appear to be influenced by the distinct host population genetics of R. affinis and R. sinicus species. The comparison of SARSr-CoVs further showed varied impact of host specificity along genome-wide diversification and modular viral evolution among Rhinolophus species. Overall, the findings point to a complex interaction between host genetic diversity, and the way viruses spread and structure within natural populations, calling for continued surveillance efforts to understand factors driving viral transmission and emergence in human populations. These results present the underestimated spillover risk of bat viruses, highlighting the importance of enhancing preparedness and surveillance for emerging zoonotic viruses.

AB  - Our awareness of air-borne sounds in natural and urban habitats has led to the recent recognition of soundscape ecology and ecoacoustics as interdisciplinary fields of research that can help us better understand ecological processes and ecosystem dynamics. Because the vibroscape (i.e., the substrate-borne vibrations occurring in a given environment) is hidden to the human senses, we have largely overlooked its ecological significance. Substrate vibrations provide information crucial to the reproduction and survival of most animals, especially arthropods, which are essential to ecosystem functioning. Thus, vibroscape is an important component of the environment perceived by the majority of animals. Nowadays, when the environment is rapidly changing due to human activities, climate change, and invasive species, this hidden vibratory world is also likely to change without our notice, with potentially crucial effects on arthropod communities. Here, we introduce ecotremology, a discipline that mainly aims at studying substrate-borne vibrations for unraveling ecological processes and biological conservation. As biotremology follows the main research concepts of bioacoustics, ecotremology is consistent with the paradigms of ecoacoustics. We argue that information extracted from substrate vibrations present in the environment can be used to comprehensively assess and reliably predict ecosystem changes. We identify key research questions and discuss the technical challenges associated with ecotremology studies.

AB  - Beehive deterrents are commonly used to mitigate human-elephant conflict and protect woody vegetation. To ensure hive activity, reduce abscondment risks, and maintain deterrent effectiveness, resident bee colonies require supplementary feeding during periods of low resource availability. However, our study found that ants frequently consume the supplementary feed in open feeders intended for bees. Anoplolepis custodiens was the most numerically dominant species that excluded bees from the feeders, followed by Camponotus and Crematogaster spp. With higher ant abundance, the predicted probability of zero bees being present at feeders increased up to 82%. This competition may undermine the efficacy of beehive deterrents as a conflict mitigation tool. We developed a simple and effective ant exclusion method that raised the overall predicted probability of bees' presence at supplementary feeding stations from 32% to 68%. Our findings suggest that innovative solutions to exclude ants from supplementary feed may improve the implementation and success of this conflict mitigation method across Africa.

AB  - Despite expanding in-situ observations of marine ecosystems by new-generation sensors, information about intermediate trophic levels remains sparse. Indeed, mid-trophic levels, while encompassing a broad range of zooplankton and micronekton organisms that represent a key component of marine ecosystems and sustain large and diverse communities of marine predators, are challenging to sample and identify. In this study, we examined whether an animal-borne miniature active echosounder can provide information on the distribution and movements of mid-trophic level organisms. If so, such a sonar tag, harnessing the persistent diving behaviour of far-ranging marine mammals, could greatly increase the density of data on this under-studied biome. Highfrequency (1.5 MHz) sonar tags were deployed simultaneously with oceanographic tags on two southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina), at the Kerguelen Islands and Valde ' s Peninsula (Argentina), and recorded acoustic backscatter while the seals foraged respectively in the Indian and the Atlantic sectors of the Southern Ocean. The backscatter varied widely over time and space, and the seals attempted to capture only a small fraction of the insonified targets. Diel vertical migration patterns were clearly identifiable in the data, reinforcing our confidence in the ability of the sonar tags to detect living mid-trophic organisms along with possibly sinking biological detritus. Moreover, CTD tags attached to the same animals indicated how the abundance, size distribution, and diel migration behaviour of acoustic targets varied with water bodies. These preliminary results demonstrate the potential for animal-borne sonars to provide detailed in-situ information. Further validation effort will make it a valuable tool to refine the estimation of carbon export fluxes as well as for assessing the variation of mid-trophic level biomass according to oceanographic domains and seasons.

AB  - Determining the factors influencing reproductive rates is important for modeling and managing wildlife populations. In ungulates, these vital rates are often related to intrinsic characteristics such as age and body condition. We studied mid-winter pregnancy and early reproductive outcomes (offspring viability) in a reintroduced elk (Cervus canadensis) population in southeastern Kentucky, USA, modeling these rates as a function of age, body condition score, and body mass with generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) fit within an information-theoretic framework to determine which factors best predicted reproductive potential. Our models for pregnancy status suggested that pregnancy was strongly correlated with body mass and weakly with age and body condition, while models for offspring viability suggested that none of the covariates measured were predictive of parturition and offspring viability. While body mass appeared to be the strongest correlate of reproductive potential in this population, other physiological and nutritional variables likely play a role in pregnancy or fetal survival, and future work should aim to understand how these parameters both influence reproduction and are influenced by habitat management.

AB  - Alpine grasslands are essential for carbon sequestration and food supply for domestic and wild herbivores inhabiting mountainous areas worldwide. These biomes, however, are alternatively threatened by the abandonment of agricultural and livestock practices leading to a fast-growing shrubification process while other mountain grasslands are suffering from the impacts of overgrazing. The functioning of alpine meadow ecosystems is primarily driven by climatic conditions, land-use legacies and grazing. However, although it is critically important, the role of large herbivores on the aboveground biomass and protein content of palatable plants is poorly understood for most alpine meadows. In this work, we explore the effects of grazing on grassland vegetation at two different spatial and temporal scales in the Eastern Pyrenees, Spain. Remote sensing was used to assess the effect of high and moderate grazing (HG and MG respectively) on grass biomass using the leaf area index (LAI) at the meso-scale (patches between 2.3 and 38.7 ha). We also explored the impact of null (NG), overgrazing (MO, mimicked overgrazing) and high (HG) grazing intensities at local scale setting eighteen 1 m2 exclusion boxes in six meadows (three boxes each) commonly used by domestic and wild ungulates. Historical satellite data showed that LAI values are greater in high than in low grazed areas (HG, mean = 0.66, LG, mean = 0.55). Along the same lines, high and moderate grazing pressures improved biomass production at the local-scale (HG, mean = 590.3 g/m(2), MO, mean = 389.3 g/m(2) and NG, mean = 110.8 g/m(2)). Crude protein content reached higher values under MO pressure than under HG pressure. Our results confirm that grazing intensity exerts significant changes on the above-ground biomass production and the protein content of plants consumed by domestic (cattle and horses) and wild ungulates (Southern Chamois, Rupicapra pyrenaica). We can conclude that ungulates sustain biomass and nutritive values of grass exerting a negligible effect on biomass and protein content of woody vegetation. Our results will inform management guidelines to support profitable grazing activities and promote conservation of the open landscapes in the alpine ecosystems under the current global change scenario.

AB  - Background Despite recent advances in understanding the drivers of tree-level delayed mortality, we lack a method for mapping delayed mortality at landscape and regional scales. Consequently, the extent, magnitude, and effects of delayed mortality on post-fire landscape patterns of burn severity are unknown. We introduce a remote sensing approach for mapping delayed mortality based on post-fire decline in the normalized burn ratio (NBR). NBR decline is defined as the change in NBR between the first post-fire measurement and the minimum NBR value up to 5 years post-fire for each pixel. We validate the method with high-resolution aerial photography from six wildfires in California, Oregon, and Washington, USA, and then compare the extent, magnitude, and effects of delayed mortality on landscape patterns of burn severity among fires and forest types.Results NBR decline was significantly correlated with post-fire canopy mortality (r(2) = 0.50) and predicted the presence of delayed mortality with 83% accuracy based on a threshold of 105 NBR decline. Plots with NBR decline greater than 105 were 23 times more likely to experience delayed mortality than those below the threshold (p < 0.001). Delayed mortality occurred across 6-38% of fire perimeters not affected by stand-replacing fire, generally affecting more areas in cold (22-41%) and wet (30%) forest types than in dry (1.7-19%) types. The total area initially mapped as unburned/very low-severity declined an average of 38.1% and generally persisted in smaller, more fragmented patches when considering delayed mortality. The total area initially mapped as high-severity increased an average of 16.2% and shifted towards larger, more contiguous patches.Conclusions Differences between 1- and 5-year post-fire burn severity maps depict dynamic post-fire mosaics resulting from delayed mortality, with variability among fires reflecting a range of potential drivers. We demonstrate that tree-level delayed mortality scales up to alter higher-level landscape patterns of burn severity with important implications for forest resilience and a range of fire-driven ecological outcomes. Our method can complement existing tree-level studies on drivers of delayed mortality, refine mapping of fire refugia, inform estimates of habitat and carbon losses, and provide a more comprehensive assessment of landscape and regional scale fire effects and trends.

AB  - Both natural and anthropogenic stressors are increasing on coral reefs, resulting in large-scale loss of coral and potential shifts from coral- to macroalgae-dominated community states. Two factors implicated in shifts to macroalgae are nutrient enrichment and fishing of reef herbivores. Although either of these factors alone could facilitate establishment of macroalgae, reefs may be particularly vulnerable to coral-to-algae phase shifts in which strong bottom-up forcing from nutrient enrichment is accompanied by a weakening of herbivore control of macroalgae via intense fishing. We explored spatial heterogeneity and covariance in these drivers on reefs in the lagoons of Moorea, French Polynesia, where the local fishery heavily targets herbivorous fishes and there are spatially variable inputs of nutrients from agricultural fertilizers and wastewater systems. Spatial patterns of fishing and nutrient enrichment were not correlated at the two landscape scales we examined: among the 11 interconnected lagoons around the island or among major habitats (fringing reef, mid-lagoon, back reef) within a lagoon. This decoupling at the landscape scale resulted from patterns of covariation between enrichment and fishing that differed qualitatively between cross-shore and long-shore directions. At the cross-shore scale, nutrient enrichment declined but fishing increased from shore to the crest of the barrier reef. By contrast, nutrient enrichment and fishing were positively correlated in the long-shore direction, with both increasing with proximity to a pass in the barrier reef. Contrary to widespread assumptions in the scientific literature that human coastal population density correlates with impact on marine ecosystems and that fishing effort declines linearly with distance from the shore, these local stressors produced a complex spatial mosaic of reef vulnerabilities. Our findings support spatially explicit management involving the control of anthropogenic nutrients and strategic reductions in fishing pressure on herbivores by highlighting specific areas to target for management actions.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Pollination is important for fertilization, setting fruits, seed development and the continuation of the life cycle of plants that eventually provide food for humans, livestock and wildlife. Agronomic practices, use of pesticides, lack of diverse flowering plant species, introduction of invasive plants, loss of habitat, climate change and disease have all led to the decline of important pollinator species. Decline of insect pollinators has increased the importance of accurately monitoring pollinator diversity and abundance over time. Sampling techniques using different color traps are used to sample bees and other insects, but their utility and effectiveness in different ecosystems still need to be determined. In this study, we examined four different colors of pan traps (blue, green, yellow, and purple) for their utility in sampling bees in a livestock pasture ecosystem consisting of native forage species. We analyzed the relative abundance, richness, similarity, and community assemblage patterns associated with aforementioned colors. We found that the blue color traps were the most attractive to bees and were effective for sampling bees in a livestock pasture ecosystem. Purple color traps were the second most effective, followed by yellow and green color traps.
   The decline in insect pollinators has increased the importance of accurately monitoring pollinator diversity and abundance over time. Sampling techniques include the use of passive insect traps such as pan traps, yet there is still discussion over their utility and effectiveness in different ecosystems. The objective was to examine four different colors of pan traps (blue, green, yellow, and purple) for their utility in sampling bees in native forages rotationally grazed by sheep and to compare the relative abundance, richness, similarity, and community assemblage patterns among the four trap colors. Most bees were from the Halictidae family (89%). The most abundant species were Lasioglossum imitatum (42.2%), Augochlorella aurata (8.3%), L. subviridatum (6.8), Agapostemon texanus (6.4), and L. birkmani (4.1%). Blue color traps exhibited the highest rates of bee capture and species accumulation. Purple and yellow colored traps were moderately effective in capturing bees, while the green color pan traps were least effective. Similarly, observed and extrapolated species richness was highest in blue trap, followed by purple, yellow, and green. Notably, the blue trap captured the highest number of unique species, followed by purple, yellow and green traps. Considering the total number of insects collected (including bees and other insects), yellow and green traps captured a significantly higher number of insects than other colored traps. The light reflectance from blue, purple, green and yellow pan traps had peaks at similar to 450, 400, 550, and 600 nm, respectively. Since different insects respond to different light intensities, wavelengths, and reflectivity, these results could be used to guide future trapping protocols targeting certain insect groups in livestock pasture and similar ecosystems.

AB  - Wolves (Canis lupus), a once widely distributed species, were systematically removed from many temperate zone ecosystems due to conflicts with humans. A change in human attitudes and cultural norms has brought about a recovery in some suitable areas, yet reintroductions are still controversial. Two notable reintroduction areas in the United States were Yellowstone and Isle Royale National Parks. Both proposals caused polarization and debate. In Yellowstone opposition focused on outside the park effects, mainly wolves killing livestock and wild game also desired by human hunters. At Isle Royale, opposition was mostly about human interventions into nature and impairment of wilderness values contrary to the spirit of 1964 Wilderness Act. Both locations had periods in the 20th century with and without wolves and the presence of wolves had a dampening effect on ungulate population fluctuations. Most outcomes of reintroduction at Yellowstone were predicted as the Environmental Impact Statement written beforehand correctly predicted 78% of the 51 outcomes that were examined. Wolves were too recently reintroduced to Isle Royale to make similar comparisons, but we conclude that intervention is not contrary to the Wilderness Act, nor author Howard Zahniser's vision, partially because wolf reintroduction was a mitigation for human actions. Also, not intervening, or inaction, often perceived as safer, would have had more damaging impacts to ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Niche differentiation is a key stabilizing mechanism in the maintenance of biodiversity and species coexistence. Recent work shows that trophic niche partitioning between parrotfishes (Labridae: Scarini) is more extensive than previously described. One Indo-Pacific species, Scarus spinus, appears highly specialized, scraping crustose coralline algae (CCA) with powerful oral jaws. CCA are of low nutritional value, suggesting that the dietary targets of this parrotfish are protein-rich microphotoautotrophs associated with CCA, particularly filamentous cyanobacteria. We collected feeding substrata samples at mid-shelf and outer-shelf sites near Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia, in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Scarus spinus were followed on snorkel. When biting was observed, bite substrata were photographed and then a 22-mm-diameter core extracted around the bite site. Density of biota including filamentous cyanobacteria and diatoms was quantified microscopically on photographs of the bite cores (up to 630 x magnification). The taxonomy of cyanobacteria and CCA was refined using next-generation sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA genes, respectively. CCA and filamentous cyanobacteria were present on all bite cores and the density of filamentous cyanobacteria where S. spinus fed did not vary between mid-shelf and outer-reef samples. Epiphytic and shallow endophytic cyanobacteria were consistently associated with the CCA where S. spinus fed, including Calothrix spp., Mastigocoleus testarum, Leptolyngbya spp., Hyella patelloides and Oscillatoriales. Our results emphasize the importance of high-resolution species-specific dietary data for parrotfishes. We conclude that polyphasic methods are essential both for diet tracing and to develop our understanding of the cyanobacteria that are integral to coral reef functioning.

AB  - Environmental change is multidimensional, with local anthropogenic stressors and global climate change interacting to differentially impact populations throughout a species' geographic range. Within species, the spatial distribution of phenotypic variation and its causes (i.e., local adaptation or plasticity) will determine species' adaptive capacity to respond to a changing environment. However, comparatively less is known about the spatial scale of adaptive differentiation among populations and how patterns of local adaptation might drive vulnerability to global change stressors. To test whether fine-scale (2-12 km) mosaics of environmental stress can cause adaptive differentiation in a marine foundation species, eelgrass (Zostera marina), we conducted a three-way reciprocal transplant experiment spanning the length of Tomales Bay, CA. Our results revealed strong home-site advantage in growth and survival for all three populations. In subsequent common garden experiments and feeding assays, we showed that countergradients in temperature, light availability, and grazing pressure from an introduced herbivore contribute to differential performance among populations consistent with local adaptation. Our findings highlight how local-scale mosaics in environmental stressors can increase phenotypic variation among neighboring populations, potentially increasing species resilience to future global change. More specifically, we identified a range-center eelgrass population that is pre-adapted to extremely warm temperatures similar to those experienced by low-latitude range-edge populations of eelgrass, demonstrating how reservoirs of heat-tolerant phenotypes may already exist throughout a species range. Future work on predicting species resilience to global change should incorporate potential buffering effects of local-scale population differentiation and promote a phenotypic management approach to species conservation.

AB  - Since prehistory, humans have altered the composition of ecosystems by causing extinctions and introducing species. However, our understanding of how waves of species extinctions and introductions influence the structure and function of ecological networks through time remains piecemeal. Here, focusing on Australia, which has experienced many extinctions and introductions since the Late Pleistocene, we compared the functional trait composition of Late Pleistocene (130,00-115,000 years before present [ybp]), Holocene (11,700-3,000 ybp), and current Australian mammalian predator assemblages (>= 70% vertebrate meat consumption; >= 1 kg adult body mass). We then constructed food webs for each period based on estimated prey body mass preferences. We found that introduced predators are functionally distinct from extinct Australian predators, but they rewire food webs toward a state that closely resembles the Late Pleistocene, prior to the megafauna extinctions. Both Late Pleistocene and current-day food webs consist of an apex predator and three smaller predators. This leads to food web networks with a similar total number of links, link densities, and compartmentalizations. However, this similarity depends on the presence of dingoes: in their absence, food webs become simplified and reminiscent of those following the Late Pleistocene extinctions. Our results suggest that recently established predators, even those implicated in species extinctions and declines, can restore complexity to food webs simplified by extinction.

AB  - The Southern Ocean has been disproportionately affected by climate change and is therefore an ideal place to study the influence of changing environmental conditions on ecosystems. Changes in the demography of predator populations are indicators of broader shifts in food web structure, but long-term data are required to study these effects. Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) from Macquarie Island have consistently decreased in population size while all other major populations across the Southern Ocean have recently stabilized or are increasing. Two long-term mark-recapture studies (1956-1967 and 1993-2009) have monitored this population, which provides an opportunity to investigate demographic performance over a range of climatic conditions. Using a 9-state matrix population model, we estimated climate influences on female survival by incorporating two major climatic indices into our model: The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). Our best model included a 1 year lagged effect of SAM and an unlagged SOI as covariates. A positive relationship with SAM1 (lagged) related the previous year's SAM with juvenile survival, potentially due to changes in local prey availability surrounding Macquarie Island. The unlagged SOI had a negative effect on both juvenile and adult seals, indicating that sea ice dynamics and access to foraging grounds on the East Antarctic continental shelf could explain the different contributions of ENSO events on the survival of females in this population.

AB  - Conservation of biodiversity in protected areas is often threatened by invasive alien plants (IAPs), and its successful management requires proper planning, resources, and monitoring to adjust future interventions. Although follow-up controls and evaluation of different management actions through monitoring programs are crucial in an adaptive management strategy, they are often neglected. Acacia longifolia is one of the most widespread IAPs in the Portuguese coastal areas, causing several negative impacts. This study reports the results of different control methods of A. longifolia in two forest plantations over coastal dunes in two protected sites in Portugal, under different management regimes and for over 4 years. The best results were achieved after hand pulling, but due to its high cost, this method is not suitable for large areas. Mechanical cuts, which include the use of brush hogs, brush cutters, and chainsaws, resulted in variable levels of resprouting of A. longifolia stumps. Follow-up treatments, whether mechanical and/or chemical, reduced the number of A. longifolia resprouts and kept its cover below 20% and height below 50 cm. Furthermore, controlling with brush cutters/hogs reduced the seed bank of A. longifolia by 74% while that with a disc harrow allowed an even greater reduction (91%). In areas where no follow-up treatments were carried out, A. longifolia started producing flowers two and a half years after the initial treatment, restarting the cycle of seed production. Nevertheless, a biological control agent that reduces A. longifolia seed production (Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae) establishment was confirmed in the controlled areas, suggesting that new seed production by these plants will be soon controlled. Although species characteristic of the protected habitats are currently poorly represented, it is expected that they begin to emerge with the reduction of A. longifolia. Our results stress the importance of persistence of follow-up treatments if higher success in IAPs control is to be achieved, not only because of the resprouting ability of many species (despite this not being very common in A. longifolia) but also because invasive plants can produce extensive persistent seed banks. The role of the management regime on the level of success in controlling IAPs will be discussed.

AB  - Background and Aims Plants have evolved various defences against herbivores, including direct chemical and structural defences and co-opted biological defences by predatory insects. However, the effects of abiotic habitat conditions on the quantitative expression of defence traits of spiny species have not been elucidated. Methods Here, we investigated whether a spiny deciduous tree, Aralia elata (Miq.) Seem., changes its defence expression across light and nutrient gradients. We measured allocation to spines and C-based secondary metabolites (condensed tannins and total phenols) on A. elata plants growing across light and nutrient gradients in situ in natural landscapes in Japan. Second, we examined the effects of light and soil nutrient condition on allocation to shoot organs, spines and chemical defences of juveniles of two genotypes of the species, respectively spiny (mainland population) and non-spiny (island population), grown in a glasshouse. Key Results In the field investigation, absolute spine mass, spine mass fraction, total phenols and condensed tannins all responded positively to canopy openness. Total phenol content was also negatively related to soil N. In the glasshouse, spiny genotype individuals had less total biomass, had lower stem allocation and were shorter than non-spiny genotype individuals. In spiny genotype trees, both spine mass fraction and total phenols decreased under low light conditions. Nutrient additions had negative effects on spine mass fraction and total phenols, but no effect on absolute spine mass. Conclusions These results suggest that development of spines is costly for A. elata and receives greater allocation when carbohydrate supply is more plentiful. Thus, light is a more important determinant of spine allocation than soil nutrients for A. elata.

AB  - Sexual competition is increasingly recognized as an important selective pressure driving species distributions. However, few studies have investigated the relative importance of interpopulation versus intrapopulation competition in relation to habitat availability and selection. To explain spatial segregation between sexes that often occurs in non-territorial and central place foragers, such as seabirds, two hypotheses are commonly used. The 'competitive exclusion' hypothesis states that dominant individuals should exclude subordinate individuals through direct competition, whereas the 'niche divergence' hypothesis states that segregation occurs due to past competition and habitat specialization. We tested these hypotheses in two populations of an extreme wide-ranging and sexually dimorphic seabird, investigating the relative role of intrapopulation and interpopulation competition in influencing sex-specific distribution and habitat preferences. Using GPS loggers, we tracked 192 wandering albatrosses Diomedea exulans during four consecutive years (2016-2019), from two neighbouring populations in the Southern Ocean (Prince Edward and Crozet archipelagos). We simulated pseudo-tracks to create a null spatial distribution and used Kernel Density Estimates (KDE) and Resource Selection Functions (RSF) to distinguish the relative importance of within- versus between-population competition. Kernel Density Estimates showed that only intrapopulation sexual segregation was significant for each monitoring year, and that tracks between the two colonies resulted in greater overlap than expected from the null distribution, especially for the females. RSF confirmed these results and highlighted key at-sea foraging areas, even if the estimated of at-sea densities were extremely low. These differences in selected areas between sites and sexes were, however, associated with high interannual variability in habitat preferences, with no clear specific preferences per site and sex. Our results suggest that even with low at-sea population densities, historic intrapopulation competition in wide-ranging seabirds may have led to sexual dimorphism and niche specialization, favouring the 'niche divergence' hypothesis. In this study, we provide a protocol to study competition within as well as between populations of central place foragers. This is relevant for understanding their distribution patterns and population regulation, which could potentially improve management of threatened populations.

AB  - 1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Trapa natans L. (water caltrop and water chestnut) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the International Biological Flora: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, conservation and global heterogeneity. 2. The water caltrop is an annual herbaceous hydrophyte rooted in the sediment of water bodies, forming flexuous underwater stems that create a buoyant, light-capturing leaf rosette at the water surface. The submerged stem nodes additionally bear linear leaves. These are replaced by photosynthetically active, pinnately branched structures and unbranched adventitious roots early on, which complement previously established roots on the hypocotyl, altogether facilitating anchorage, nutrient and water absorption, aeration and capture of subsurface irradiance. Solitary flowers pollinated primarily through autogamy and incidentally through entomophily give rise to a fully developed edible single-seeded drupe with two to four barbed horns. Fruits are dispersed with the help of hydrochory, epizoochory and anthropochory. 3. Throughout its lowland, global temperate, subtropical and tropical distribution in Eurasia and Africa, the thermophilic macrophyte is found in shallow, sun-exposed, nutrient-rich freshwater bodies with low-velocity flows and steady water levels. These offer slightly acidic to mildly basic conditions. The accompanying soft substrate is usually characterized by a high organic matter content. Regularly co-occurring with other macrophytes, some of which are also of conservation concern, such as those in rare stands of the association Trapetum natantis in Europe, the water caltrop has at times been outcompeted, though it may form monodominant stands, due to several competitive features. 4. Formerly widespread in Europe, T. natans is today recognized as a rare, strictly protected macrophyte. It has been introduced to Australia and North America; on the latter continent, its naturalization, spread and aggressive overgrowth have led to extensive control efforts. Having been used as a crop since Neolithic times, it is still exploited in Asia for means of food production, phytoremediation, ornamental purposes, medication and alternative uses.

AB  - Large-bodied animals play irreplaceable roles in seed dispersal, partly due to their capacity to disperse large seeds. Understanding this role at a community level has been limited by the paucity of network studies that include large vertebrates, and the almost complete absence of studies including synzoochoric dispersers. Synzoochoric dispersers can disperse seeds disproportionately large for their body size, potentially overlapping the roles of large-bodied animals. A comprehensive network, inclusive of large vertebrates and synzoochorous dispersers, is imperative to understand seed dispersal at a community level. Here, we analysed the seed dispersal network of a hyper-diverse Sundaic forest in Malaysia using local ecological knowledge and including multiple forms of endozoochorous and synzoochorous dispersal. We evaluated the extent to which three disperser traits: body mass, seed-handling ability (size of the largest seed dispersed) and diet explained the importance of animals in the network. We evaluated dispersers' relative importance using four network metrics-degree of specialisation (nested rank), species strength, within-module connectivity (z-value) and between-modules connectivity (c-value). We found that seed-handling ability had the biggest effect on a disperser's importance, with strong effects on three network metrics (species strength, ecological specialisation and z-value) and moderate effects on connectivity between modules. Body mass was important in defining interactions within modules, and dietary differences defined the ecological specialisation of species in seed dispersal. Important dispersers in our network were large-seed dispersers (e.g. rats, gibbons), large-bodied animals, in particular the Asian elephant, and animals with frugivorous diets such as hornbills. Synthesis. Our work uncovers the significance of seed-handling ability in identifying pivotal seed dispersal roles in tropical rainforests. Key dispersers include large-bodied herbivores and medium-sized frugivores that could disperse large seeds by endozoochory, and smaller rodents that dispersed similar-sized seeds by synzoochory. Many of the species that emerged as particularly important for the seed dispersal network are currently threatened (e.g. the Asian elephant, gibbons and hornbills). Their protection or reintroduction should be a top conservation priority.

AB  - Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) have among the longest annual migrations of any terrestrial mammal as they move from winter ranges to spring calving grounds. Biomonitoring records indicate broad consistencies in calving geography across the last several decades, but how long have herds used particular calving grounds? Furthermore, how representative are modern patterns of calving geography to periods that pre-date recent climatic perturbations and increased anthropogenic stresses? While modern ecological datasets are not long enough to address these questions, bones from past generations of caribou lying on the tundra provide unique opportunities to study historical calving geography. This is possible because female caribou shed their antlers within days of giving birth, releasing a skeletal indicator of calving. Today, the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (Alaska) is a key calving ground for the Porcupine Caribou Herd (PCH). To test the duration across which caribou have used this area as a calving ground, we radiocarbon dated three highly weathered female antlers collected from tundra surfaces on the Coastal Plain. Calibrated radiocarbon dates indicate that these antlers were shed between similar to 1,600 and more than 3,000 calendar years ago. The antiquity of these shed antlers provides the first physical evidence of calving activity on the PCH calving grounds from previous millennia, substantiating the long ecological legacy of the Coastal Plain as a caribou calving ground. Comparisons to published lake core records also reveal that dates of two of the antlers correspond to periods with average summer temperatures that were warmer than has been typical during the last several decades of biomonitoring. This finding expands the range of climatic settings in which caribou are known to use the current PCH calving grounds and suggests that the Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge may remain an important caribou calving ground during at least portions of predicted future warming. Discarded skeletal materials provide opportunities to assess the historical states of living populations, including aspects of reproductive biology and migration. Particularly in high-latitude settings, these insights can extend across millennia and offer rare glimpses into the past that can inform current and future management policies.

AB  - Understanding how species adapt to environmental change is necessary to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services. Growing evidence suggests species can adapt rapidly to novel selection pressures like predation from invasive species, but the repeatability and predictability of selection remain poorly understood in wild populations. We tested how a keystone aquatic herbivore, Daphnia pulicaria, evolved in response to predation pressure by the introduced zooplanktivore Bythotrephes longimanus. Using high-resolution 210Pb-dated sediment cores from 12 lakes in Ontario (Canada), which primarily differed in invasion status by Bythotrephes, we compared Daphnia population genetic structure over time using whole-genome sequencing of individual resting embryos. We found strong genetic differentiation between populations approximately 70 years before versus 30 years after reported Bythotrephes invasion, with no difference over this period in uninvaded lakes. Compared with uninvaded lakes, we identified, on average, 64 times more loci were putatively under selection in the invaded lakes. Differentiated loci were mainly associated with known reproductive and stress responses, and mean body size consistently increased by 14.1% over time in invaded lakes. These results suggest Daphnia populations were repeatedly acquiring heritable genetic adaptations to escape gape-limited predation. More generally, our results suggest some aspects of environmental change predictably shape genome evolution.

AB  - IntroductionLarvae of the invasive emerald ash borer [EAB, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)], kill over 99% of green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marshall) trees they infest, yet a small percentage of green ash ("lingering ash") survive years of heavy EAB attack. In the face of an ongoing invasion that threatens multiple North American Fraxinus species with extinction, any evidence for reproducible defensive responses in the native species merits investigation. MethodsWe evaluated the capacity of three families of green ash F-1 progeny to kill EAB larvae when challenged in greenhouse studies by infestation with a uniform density of EAB eggs followed by dissection 8 weeks post-infestation and comparison of the host metabolomic profiles. ResultsThe mean proportions of host-killed larvae in the two families of F-1 progeny from lingering ash parents were significantly higher than that of host-killed larvae in the family of F-1 progeny from susceptible ash parents (p < 0.001). Untargeted metabolomics comparing F-1 progeny in the quartile with the highest percent host-killed larvae (HHK) to F-1 progeny in the quartile with the lowest percent host-killed larvae (LHK) and to the uninfested F-1 progeny within each family revealed evidence for induced biochemical responses to EAB. Infested trees produced significantly higher levels of select secoiridoids than uninfested trees, and LHK progeny produced significantly higher levels of select secoiridoids than the HHK progeny. HHK progeny produced significantly higher abundances of three metabolites annotated as aromatic alkaloids than the LHK and uninfested individuals. DiscussionBased on these results, we hypothesize that green ash responds to EAB infestation. However, only certain trees have the genetic capacity to tailor a response that kills enough EAB larvae to prevent lethal damage to the vascular system. Rigorous tests of this hypothesis will require 15-20 years of additional crossing, phenotyping, and omics analyses. The results of this investigation will encourage the establishment and continuation of breeding programs that, in concert with biocontrol and management, could provide trees that slow, if not halt, the decimation of the Fraxinus gene pool. At the same time, ongoing work on host-insect interaction will contribute to our understanding of how forest trees recognize and defend themselves against phloem-feeding insects.

AB  - Agroforestry has a potentially important role in helping agriculture address both the climate and biodiversity crises. It provides a means of producing additional marketable goods from agricultural land and enhancing biodiversity at the same time as increasing carbon sequestration and, in silvo-pastural systems, reducing carbon emissions if livestock stocking rates are reduced. However, the uptake of agroforestry in the UK has been limited. This paper adopts Real Options techniques to explore how the decision to adopt agroforestry is influenced by the relative levels of returns from agriculture, forestry and the price of carbon under the scenario where there are financial penalties from livestock Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, financial benefits from carbon sequestration in trees and reversibility in land use decisions. The results are compared to the equivalent findings from a Land Equivalent Value capital budgeting approach to agroforestry adoption. Analysis is based on data from a case study upland livestock farm in Scotland, comparing the impacts of introducing agroforestry into the hill sheep enterprise or the low ground cattle and sheep enterprise. The results suggest that the adoption of agroforestry is far less likely than would be suggested by standard budgeting approaches, especially in more extensive upland enterprises (hill area) where sequestration benefits are low relative to more productive farmland areas (low ground area). Upfront support payments are shown to increase the likelihood of agroforestry adoption. They also have the effect of reducing the rotation length of forestry in such systems.

AB  - Linear infrastructure represent a barrier to movement for many species, reducing the connectivity of the landscapes in which they reside. Of all linear infrastructure, roads and fences are two of the most ubiquitous, and are understood to reduce landscape connectivity for wildlife. However, what is often neglected consideration is a holistic approach of modelling the effects of multiple types of linear infrastructure simultaneously. Few studies have examined this, typically assessing the impacts of a singular kind of infrastructure on landscape connectivity. Therefore, the aim of this study is to address the relative importance of considering multiple kinds of linear infrastructure in landscape connectivity modelling. We utilised presence data of red deer Cervus elaphus and wild boar Sus scrofa in Donana Biosphere Reserve (Spain) to generate a sequential approach of scenarios of landscape connectivity; firstly only with environmental variables, secondly with roads as the sole infrastructure, thirdly with the addition of fences, and finally with the further addition of fences and wildlife road-crossing structures. We found that the connectivity of the landscape was greatly affected by the addition of fences and wildlife road-crossing structures in both species, with fences in particular causing considerable alterations to estimated movement pathways. Our finding impresses a need to consider multiple different types of linear infrastructure when modelling landscape connectivity to enable a more realistic view of wildlife movement and inform mitigation and conservation measures more accurately.

AB  - Marine natural products have emerged as an important source for drug development, notably in the field of anticancer therapy. Still, the limited effectiveness of current therapies for central nervous system tumors indicates the need to identify new therapeutic targets and also novel pharmacological agents. In this context, proteasome inhibitors are appearing as a promising new treatment for these diseases. Herein, cytotoxic extracts produced by four marine bacteria recovered from the Brazilian endemic ascidian Euherdmania sp. were screened to evaluate their potential as proteasome inhibitors. The extract from marine Streptomyces sp. BRA-346 was selected for further investigation due to the potent proteasome inhibitory activity it displayed. Bioassay-guided fractionation led to an enriched fraction (proteasome inhibition IC50 = 45 ng/mL), in which the presence of dihydroeponemycin (DHE), known for its proteasome inhibitory effect, and related compounds were annotated by mass spectrometry and further confirmed by comparison with DHE standard. Both DHE and the epoxyketone-containing fraction were evaluated in glioma cell lines, displaying high cytotoxicity in HOG and T98G cells (GI(50) of 1.6 and 1.7 ng/mL for DHE, and 17.6 and 28.2 ng/mL for the BRA-346 fraction, respectively). Additional studies showed that the epoxyketone-containing fraction (at GI(50) levels) led to an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and up-regulation of genes related to ER-stress response, suggesting treated cells are under proteasome inhibition. DHE induced similar effects in treated cells but at concentrations 25 times its GI(50), suggesting that the other epoxyketone compounds in the bacteria extract derived fraction may contribute to enhance proteasome inhibition and further cellular effects in glioma cells. These findings revealed the molecular pathways modulated by this class of compounds in glioma cells and, moreover, reinforced the potential of this marine bacteria in producing a cocktail of structurally-related compounds that affect the viability of glioma cells.

AB  - Ecological theory predicts that closely related species can coexist if they segregate in space, time, or diet to reduce competitive overlap when resources are limited. These differences in ecological niche are presumably driven by concomitant differences in morphology. The link between form and functional segregation may only occur at 1 period of the year, and while examining behavioural differences among closely related species across the whole annual cycle can answer this question, it is rarely tested. Here, we investigated niche partitioning between sister species within the puffin clade: tufted puffins Fratercula cirrhata with high wing loading and rhinoceros auklets Cerorhinca monocerata with low wing loading, breeding in sympatry on Middleton Island, Alaska. We collected data for horizontal movement, dive depth, and trophic ecology. Tufted puffins dived deeper, foraged closer to the colony during breeding, and migrated shorter distances relative to rhinoceros auklets. Examination of allometric patterns further revealed that puffins exceeded the predicted dive duration limit with exceptionally long dives. However, isotopic niches of the 2 species were very similar. Rhinoceros auklet breeding phenology was about 3 wk earlier than tufted puffin phenology, and breeding success during the study period was always higher for auklets than puffins. We conclude that the 2 species of sympatric puffin partitioned both in space and time throughout the annual cycle, illustrating how such partitioning can facilitate the coexistence of seabirds sharing apparently similar space.

AB  - Feeding habits of herbivorous fishes play an important role in shaping the form and function of coastal marine ecosystems. Rabbitfishes (Siganidae) are important consumers of macroalgae on Indo-West Pacific coral reefs. However, it is unclear how their diet varies among and within species at biogeographical scales, casting doubt on their precise functional roles across different regions. The present study assessed the inter- and intra-specific diet variation of four rabbitfishes (Siganus trispilos, Siganus corallinus, Siganus virgatus and Siganus doliatus) factored by morphological relatedness among populations from Ningaloo Reef (western Australia), the Great Barrier Reef (GBR, eastern Australia) and the Yaeyama Islands (Okinawa Prefecture, Japan). Results showed that the region had a strong effect on diet, effectively reducing the expected effect of morphologic similitude. While intra-specific differences were only significant when populations inhabited different regions; interspecific differences were not as predicted, with different morphotypes having similar diets when populations inhabited the same regions. Rabbitfishes consumed more corticated and filamentous macroalgae on the GBR, more foliose and membranous macroalgae at the Yaeyama Islands, and more leathery macroalgae at Ningaloo Reef. The findings indicate that rabbitfishes have high diet plasticity, and hence their functional role as mediators of competition between macroalgae and corals can change across biogeographic regions. Local context is therefore important when assessing the diet and functional role of herbivorous fishes. As climate change unfolds, shifts in the distribution, trophic behaviour and function of species are expected, making the study of trophic plasticity more important.

AB  - Irruptions in plant and animal populations are not uncommon, but the factors underlying irruptions are rarely explored quantitatively. In addition, it has been suggested that these irruptions may be reduced by predators or herbivores, but there is a paucity of controlled experimental evidence. Using data from the Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment (KLEE), we show that populations of perennial Hibiscus spp. (primarily Hibiscus flavifolius) show multiple short-term irruptions a year after rainy periods, increasing in abundance in some cases by more than an order of magnitude before declining in ensuing months and years. We demonstrate that these irruptions are largely limited to experimental plots from which large mammalian herbivores have been excluded, particularly megaherbivores (elephants, mostly). This represents a rare controlled, replicated experimental demonstration of top-down regulation of irruptions. African elephants and giraffes are often at greater risk of local extirpation than other large mammals, and their absence appears to destabilize this African savanna ecosystem.

AB  - Understanding how carnivores impact ecological communities is essential for guiding effective management actions and conserving biodiversity. Quantifying predators' diets, including prey selectivity, allows for the assessment of the relative effects native and invasive predators may have on prey populations.
   In Australia, populations of a native, terrestrial apex predator, the dingo Canis dingo/C. familiaris, and introduced and invasive subordinate mesopredators, the European red fox Vulpes vulpes and feral cat Felis catus, co-occur, but there is limited understanding of their relative impacts on native and invasive prey in different ecosystems. To assess the possible effects of dingoes, foxes and cats on prey, we examined their diet and prey selectivity across a similar to 10,000 km(2) semi-arid mallee ecosystem.
   Using macroscopic scat analysis, we identified strong dietary niche separation. Larger-bodied dingoes primarily consumed large marsupial herbivores, whereas foxes and cats primarily consumed smaller prey, including introduced and native rodents and birds. Foxes had the broadest diet, and the greatest dietary overlap with cats (O-jk = 0.81), compared with dingoes (O-jk = 0.50) or between dingoes and cats (O-jk = 0.36).
   Livestock were identified in 2% of dingo and 7% of fox scats. Cats and foxes consumed more than 15 times the volume of small native mammals compared with dingoes, including threatened species such as fat-tailed dunnarts Sminthopsis crassicaudata. Cats and foxes also selectively consumed small mammals relative to their estimated availability and consumed fewer large mammals. In contrast, dingoes consumed fewer birds and more echidnas relative to their availability.
   Our results suggest limited intraguild competition within this semi-arid ecosystem, as dingoes are primarily exerting top-down pressure on large herbivores, whereas invasive mesopredators are disproportionately impacting smaller prey, including threatened native mammals.
   Practical implication. Our findings suggest that ongoing conservation management of dingoes, red foxes and feral cats must consider the variation in diets, impacts on prey and ecological roles of these different predator species, and avoid indiscriminate lethal control methods. Quantifying actual, rather than assumed, impacts of predators on threatened native species, large herbivores and livestock is essential to achieve effective and integrated ecosystem management.

AB  - Our understanding of the biology of the extinct pig-footed bandicoots (Chaeropus) has been substantially revised over the past two decades by both molecular and morphological research. Resolving the systematic and temporal contexts of Chaeropus evolution has relied heavily on sequencing DNA from century-old specimens. We have used sliding window BLASTs and phylogeny reconstruction, as well as cumulative likelihood and apomorphy distributions, to identify contamination in sequences from both species of pig-footed bandicoot. The sources of non-target DNA that were identified range from other bandicoot species to a bird-emphasizing the importance of sequence authentication for historical museum specimens, as has become standard for ancient DNA studies. Upon excluding the putatively contaminated fragments, Chaeropus was resolved as the sister to all other bandicoots (Peramelidae), to the exclusion of bilbies (Macrotis). The estimated divergence time between the two Chaeropus species also decreases in better agreement with the fossil record. This study provides evolutionary context for testing hypotheses on the ecological transition of pig-footed bandicoots from semi-fossorial omnivores towards cursorial grazers, which in turn may represent the only breach of deeply conserved ecospace partitioning between modern Australo-Papuan marsupial orders.

AB  - The ability to track animals with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars opened an enormous potential for studying animal movements and behaviour in their natural environment. One such endeavour is to identify clusters of GPS locations as a way to estimate predator kill rate. Clapp et al. (2021) developed an R package (GPSeqClus) to assess a location dataset based on user-defined parameters to identify clusters and their characteristics. These characteristics can then help to distinguish resting-site clusters from kill sites of their large (> 50 kg) prey.We identified location clusters of an adult male wolf Canis lupus on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada in July 2009 and tracked him until he died in April 2010. Identifying location clusters was challenging because the collar only obtained two GPS locations per day (12 h apart). In July 2010, we searched 30 of 52 location-clusters we identified as kill/scavenge sites and found 17 of them as such, given they had muskox Ovibos moschatus or caribou Rangifer tarandus pearyi remains nearby. We also documented five wolf rendezvous sites, two den sites, and the wolf's death site to total 60 location-clusters in all.We used a two-step process in testing the R Package GPSeqClus (hereafter GPSeqClus): (1) compare the number of clusters our method discerned with the number identified by the new algorithm, and (2) compare the number of biologically significant clusters (e.g. den sites, kill/feeding sites) we found with the number the new algorithm located. We made these tests with GPSeqClus by varying the search radius, number of days at a site, and minimum number of locations required for a cluster.GPSeqClus compared well to our technique, with the best sub-algorithm among the 25 we tested only missing three of our identified clusters and yielding six additional clusters. GPSeqClus identified 16 of the 17 confirmed sites of remains, all wolf home sites, and the wolf's carcass site. Identifying clusters using a 500-m search radius, a 1.5-day window, and a minimum of two GPS locations per cluster was suitable for a coarse GPS acquisition rate of two locations per day when prey are large, such as muskox or caribou.Given that GPSeqClus performed well with our coarse location dataset, we expect it will also perform even better with a collar acquiring more than two locations per day. Having a field-tested utility such as GPSeqClus will enhance carnivore predation studies elsewhere.

AB  - Increased stress on coastal ecosystems, such as coral reefs, seagrasses, kelp forests, and other habitats, can make them shift toward degraded, often algae-dominated or barren communities. This has already occurred in many places around the world, calling for new approaches to identify where such regime shifts may be triggered. Theoretical work predicts that the spatial structure of habitat-forming species should exhibit changes prior to regime shifts, such as an increase in spatial autocorrelation. However, extending this theory to marine systems requires theoretical models connecting field-supported ecological mechanisms to data and spatial patterns at relevant scales. To do so, we built a spatially explicit model of subtropical coral communities based on experiments and long-term datasets from Rapa Nui (Easter Island, Chile), to test whether spatial indicators could signal upcoming regime shifts in coral communities. Spatial indicators anticipated degradation of coral communities following increases in frequency of bleaching events or coral mortality. However, they were generally unable to signal shifts that followed herbivore loss, a widespread and well-researched source of degradation, likely because herbivory, despite being critical for the maintenance of corals, had comparatively little effect on their self-organization. Informative trends were found under both equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions but were determined by the type of direct neighbor interactions between corals, which remain relatively poorly documented. These inconsistencies show that while this approach is promising, its application to marine systems will require detailed information about the type of stressor and filling current gaps in our knowledge of interactions at play in coral communities.
   El actual aumento de las presiones sobre los ecosistemas costeros como los arrecifes de coral pueden conducir a un cambio repentino hacia un estado degradado, a menudo dominado por alga o roca desnuda. La elevada occurrencia de esta rapida degradacion a escala global destaca la necesidad de nuevas aproximaciones para la prediccion de tales cambios de estado. Los trabajos teoricos predicen que cambios en la estructura espacial de las especies creadoras de habitat deberian preceder los cambios repentinos de estado, por ejemplo con un aumento de la autocorrelacion espacial. Sin embargo, aplicar tal aproximacion requiere modelos que vinculen documentados mecanismos ecologicos con patrones especiales a las escalas adecuadas. En este trabajo proponemos un modelo espacialmente explicito de comunidades subtropicales de coral basado en trabajos a largo plazo en Rapa Nui (Isla de Pascua, Chile), para evaluar si los indicadores espaciales de cambios de estado repentinos pueden funcionar como indicadores tempranos en estos ecosistemas. Los resultados muestran que indicadores espaciales preceden la degradacion abrupta de comunidades de coral debido a un aumento de la mortalidad coralina, o de la frequencia de episodios de blanqueamiento. Sin embargo, no aparecen capaces de senalar cambios repentinos tras la perdida de herbivoros, un tipo de estres comun en comunidades coralinas. Se encontraron tendencias informativas tanto en condiciones de equilibrio como fuera de equilibrio, pero estas dependen del tipo de interaccion local entre corales, lo cual sigue poco documentado. Esta variacion en las tendencias destaca la necesidad de un conocimiento detallado tanto de las presiones como de las interacciones locales entre corals para llegar a una aplicacion informativa de los indicadores de cambios repentinos en ecosistemas marinos.

AB  - Biologists increasingly use translocation to restore animals to areas where they have been extirpated. However, we know little about how translocation decisions influence translocation-mediated social dynamics. Breeding in polygynous ungulate mating systems is typically dominated by prime age males, but founding males within translocated ungulate populations often are comprised of only young individuals. We investigated the influence of releasing exclusively young-aged males on mating system and male reproductive success during an elk (Cervus canadensis) restoration program in Missouri. From 2011 to 2013, we translocated and released 106 elk from Kentucky to Missouri, U.S.A. We collected tissue samples for DNA from all translocated elk and subsequently captured adults and calves in Missouri during 2014-2018 for paternity analysis. Initial levels of polygyny were low but increased and acclimated over the initial years following translocation, commensurate with advancing sire age structure and increasing population density. Sire age was positively associated with individual male reproductive success initially, but the effect of age decreased as polygyny acclimated and sire age structure became older and more variable. Polygyny levels in the reintroduced population were restored to expected values within 4 years of the last translocation event, demonstrating the acclimation of mating structure despite a translocation tactic favoring young-aged males. Importantly, initial dampened polygyny may facilitate retention of genetic variation by maximizing the genetic contribution of more founding individuals; however, benefits to genetic variation retention should be considered against potential demographic consequences to calves sired by young males.

AB  - Simple Summary Aerated burial systems involve slow air circulation within a mound, caused naturally or artificially. The weak airflow allows bacteria to work in an aerobic environment, accelerating the natural skeletonisation process. The main objective of this study was to document the decomposition level of an animal carcass in an aerated and watertight niche in a special epigean loculus. Pig carcasses (weighing approximately 70 kg each) were used as an experimental model for testing differences between the two systems. Each carcass was removed from the niches at predefined intervals, and the degree of decomposition and the presence of macrofauna were verified. The study examined if insects could colonise carcasses in the two burial systems to determine which fauna were present during the sampling dates. The possible existence of bacterial colonies was also assessed after five years. Our experiments showed that aerated burials facilitate skeletonisation similarly to watertight burial methods. Therefore, aerated burials are a viable alternative to watertight burials in terms of reducing both decomposition time and the costs of urban cemetery planning. It is also an alternative to interment in cemeteries where the soil cannot properly skeletonise. Aerated entombment applies to both hypogeum and epigean solutions. In recent years, burial systems have covered increasingly higher costs due to the pollution caused by decomposition products. These products are understood as chemicals and microorganisms in the surrounding soil and groundwater and represent a topical issue. The purpose of this research was to ascertain the extent of decomposition when pig carcasses are buried in two different burial systems ("aerated" vs. "watertight") and catalogue the arthropods associated with burials at different time-points of removal from niches (after 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months). Thirteen taxa were collected in aerated niches, whereas five were collected in watertight niches. The initial access or exclusion of insect colonisers affected overall functional activity. Two Diptera species, Hydrotaea capensis and Megaselia scalaris, were the most abundant, supporting the hypothesis that insects can colonise carcasses in aerated burial systems. Furthermore, some species of bacteria have been documented as facilitators of the initial decomposition process of the carcass. Most bacterial colonies develop only in aerated niches. The trial showed that the first enzymatic-bacterial and insect actions helped promote the process of cadaveric decomposition and later skeletonisation, mainly when associated with aeration modes of the tomb/mound. The results obtained provide essential information on the process of human decomposition and taphonomy in cemeteries. Moreover, these data could benefit forensic science by adding information on insect colonisation and body modification in medico-legal investigations concerning the post-mortem interval in exhumed bodies and illegal burials.

AB  - Once widespread in their homelands, the Anatolian mouflon (Ovis gmelini anatolica) and the Cyprian mouflon (Ovis gmelini ophion) were driven to near extinction during the 20th century and are currently listed as endangered populations by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. While the exact origins of these lineages remain unclear, they have been suggested to be close relatives of domestic sheep or remnants of proto-domestic sheep. Here, we study whole genome sequences of n = 5 Anatolian mouflons and n = 10 Cyprian mouflons in terms of population history and diversity, comparing them with eight other extant sheep lineages. We find reciprocal genetic affinity between Anatolian and Cyprian mouflons and domestic sheep, higher than all other studied wild sheep genomes, including the Iranian mouflon (O. gmelini). Studying diversity indices, we detect a considerable load of short runs of homozygosity blocks (<2 Mb) in both Anatolian and Cyprian mouflons, reflecting small effective population size (N-e). Meanwhile, N-e and mutation load estimates are lower in Cyprian compared with Anatolian mouflons, suggesting the purging of recessive deleterious variants in Cyprian sheep under a small long-term N-e, possibly attributable to founder effects, island isolation, introgression from domestic lineages, or differences in their bottleneck dynamics. Expanding our analyses to worldwide wild and feral Ovis genomes, we observe varying viability metrics among different lineages and a limited consistency between viability metrics and International Union for Conservation of Nature conservation status. Factors such as recent inbreeding, introgression, and unique population dynamics may have contributed to the observed disparities.

AB  - Reef fish communities are shaped by historical and ecological factors, including abiotic and biotic mechanisms at different spatial scales, determining species composition, abundance and biomass. The oceanic islands in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (St. Peter and St. Paul's Archipelago - SPSPA, Ascension, and St. Helena), exhibiting differences in community structure along a 14-degree latitudinal and a 10 degrees C thermal gradient. We investigate the influence of sea surface temperature, area, age, isolation and phosphate on reef fish community structures. Reef fish trophic structure varies significantly across the islands, with planktivores and herbivore-detritivores showing the highest abundances in SPSPA and Ascension, while less abundant in St. Helena, aligning with the thermal gradient. Variations in reef fish community structures were predominantly influenced by thermal regimes, corroborating the expansion of species' thermal niche breadth at higher latitudes and lower temperatures. This study highlights that in addition to biogeographic factors, temperature is pivotal on shaping oceanic island reef fish community structure.

AB  - Pathogens introduced into wildlife populations can cause population declines and pose a threat to conservation. Understanding how pathogens spread through wildlife populations requires information about animal space use across the landscape. The abundance of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in western North America has declined in response to pathogens introduced concurrently with the expansion of domestic sheep. Wildlife and land management agencies use bighorn sheep seasonal home range models to assess and mitigate pathogen transmission risk among bighorn and domestic sheep populations. Current risk assessment tools assume that seasonal home ranges are annually consistent, but the extent to which deviations from this assumption could render erroneous predictions about pathogen introduction risk has not received extensive attention. To evaluate the influence of temporally variable environmental conditions on pathogen introduction risk, we used locations of desert bighorn sheep (O. c. nelsoni) gathered across 6 populations residing in the Mojave Desert, an environment characterized by high interannual variation in precipitation and forage production. Our objectives were to assess whether seasonal home range sizes varied consistently with temporally varying attributes of the environment and assess the influence of varying environmental attributes on pathogen introduction risk using our model results and the United States Forest Service's Risk of Contact (ROC) tool. Home range sizes varied by sex and season, with higher environmental moisture levels (Palmer drought severity index) associated with larger male home ranges in summer and fall-winter. Higher spatial variation in primary productivity was associated with smaller male home range sizes in summer but with larger male home range sizes in fall-winter. Female home ranges were also smaller when variation in primary productivity was high during spring but had no detectable relation with environmental moisture or spatial variation in productivity during the rest of the year. We combined these results with the ROC tool to simulate the influence of varying environmental attributes on pathogen introduction risk. Those simulations suggested that home range expansions associated with above-average environmental moisture only increased the contact risk between 2 adjacent populations by 0.02%. Consequently, risk forecasts in the Mojave Desert system might be relatively robust to temporally dynamic home range sizes, so long as the environmental attributes driving home range size do not deviate dramatically from historical levels. However, major departures from long-term trends in environmental variation could lead to more dramatic effects on home range size and subsequent risk and should be reassessed if environmental variation changes substantially in the future.

AB  - Wildlife fences are often considered an important tool in conservation. Fences are used in attempts to prevent human-wildlife conflict and reduce poaching, despite known negative impacts on landscape connectivity and animal movement patterns. Such impacts are likely to be particularly important for wide-ranging species, such as the African wild dog Lycaon pictus, which requires large areas of continuous habitat to fulfil its resource requirements. Laikipia County in northern Kenya is an important area for wild dogs but new wildlife fences are increasingly being built in this ecosystem. Using a long-term dataset from the area's free-ranging wild dog population, we evaluated the effect of wildlife fence structure on the ability of wild dogs to cross them. The extent to which fences impeded wild dog movement differed between fence designs, although individuals crossed fences of all types. Purpose-built fence gaps increased passage through relatively impermeable fences. Nevertheless, low fence permeability can lead to packs, or parts of packs, becoming trapped on the wrong side of a fence, with consequences for population dynamics. Careful evaluation should be given to the necessity of erecting fences; ecological impact assessments should incorporate evaluation of impacts on animal movement patterns and should be undertaken for all large-scale fencing interventions. Where fencing is unavoidable, projects should use the most permeable fencing structures possible, both in the design of the fence and including as many purpose-built gaps as possible, to minimize impacts on wide-ranging wildlife.

AB  - Successful establishment of desired species during restoration is challenging in drylands. Much research has focused on the importance of the critical life stages such as germination and emergence, but factors influencing survival through the seedling stages of perennial grasses may be equally important. We asked whether seedling defoliation by insects and/or mammals could cause restoration failure. We quantified the degree of defoliation on seedlings of common perennial grass species at 46 restoration sites throughout Oregon, Idaho, and Nevada, and calculated survival probabilities during the first growing season after planting. At each site, we excluded small mammals and insects for 6 weeks and compared defoliation and survival probabilities with seedlings in controls without exclusions. Seedlings were classified as either: large perennial grasses (LPG), primarily from the Triticeae tribe, or Bluegrasses (Poa spp.). Defoliation of LPG reduced seedling survival, but the effect was small compared to the influence of meteorological variables, such as precipitation and temperature. Based on bite patterns, most defoliation resulted from insects. Only a small percentage of vegetation was removed (36% of individuals were defoliated, mean = 13.2% vegetation removal). Defoliation of bluegrasses was less common than that of LPG seedlings, with only 16% experiencing defoliation, primarily from insects (mean = 4.3% vegetation removal). Some defoliation did occur within the exclusion treatments, but the effect of defoliation on seedling survival did not appear to interact with treatment. Based on the results of this study, seedling herbivory is unlikely to be a major factor in restoration failure in the Northern Great Basin.

AB  - Bananas and plantains are major commodity/food crops that represent an important habitat for earthworms, although so far, no review is available on earthworm communities associated with banana/plantain crops worldwide. The Vale do Ribeira region is among the largest banana producing areas in Brazil, but little is known of the earthworms living there. Hence, the present study assessed earthworm populations and species in three banana plantations and adjacent Atlantic forest fragments along the Ribeira de Iguape River using standard (hand sorting) methodologies. Furthermore, we review earthworm populations reported in banana/plantain plantations worldwide. Only two species (Pontoscolex corethrurus, Amynthas gracilis) belonging to two families (Rhinodrilidae, Megascolecidae) were found in the Ribeira River valley, occurring concurrently. Abundance was low (< 13 indiv. m(-2)) compared with other banana plantations worldwide, that frequently surpassed 100 indiv. m(-2). More than 70 studies reported earthworms from >200 banana plantations in 28 countries, and mean species richness was 2.7 per site, ranging from 1 to 10 species. Exotics predominated in most sites and P. corethrurus was the most prevalent species encountered. Overall, more than 104 species from 10 families were reported, with around 61 native and 43 exotic widespread species, mainly of the Megascolecidae, Lumbricidae and Acanthodrilidae families. Richness was highest in India (27 spp.) and the Canary Islands (25 spp.), but native species dominated only in a few countries and sites, while exotics were prevalent especially in island countries and Brazil. Lower-input practices appear to be important for earthworm communities and banana plantations can have large earthworm populations in some cases, which may be contributing to soil processes and plant production, topics that deserve further attention. However, many important banana-producing countries have not yet been evaluated, so further work is warranted, both in terms of applied ecology and biodiversity.

AB  - Daily activity patterns of animals can be dynamic across seasons in response to changing environmental conditions. Daily activity, though, has rarely been evaluated in relation to multiple factors (e.g., seasons, demographics, and data collection methods), which could be important for understanding what drives activity patterns. Here, we evaluated the daily activity patterns of a widespread invasive species, wild pigs (Sus scrofa), across two ecologically different study areas at Buck Island Ranch, FL, and Tejon Ranch, CA, from 2015 to 2018. Using GPS telemetry data (62 individuals in FL, 21 individuals in CA) and detections from grids of systematically placed motion-activated cameras (44 cameras in FL, 48 cameras in CA), we compared activity patterns among seasons, sexes, and data collection methods (GPS and camera traps). Overall, wild pigs were mostly active during crepuscular and nocturnal periods, with their lowest activity during diurnal periods; however, activity patterns varied due to several factors. Daily activity patterns were similar between methods, among seasons, and between sexes in the subtropical climate of Florida. In contrast, daily activity patterns exhibited greater differences between methods and among seasons in California, where seasonal differences in temperature and precipitation were more pronounced. Overall, daily activity patterns estimated using GPS telemetry and camera-based methods not only exhibited a high degree of overlap in several comparisons but also exhibited marked differences that should be recognized. Given the increasing evaluation of daily activity patterns of animals using multiple types of datasets, our study provides ecologists with valuable information to consider when designing ecological studies, interpreting their results, and comparing research across systems and studies.

AB  - There are numerous examples of phenological shifts that are recognized both as indicators of climate change and drivers of ecosystem change. A pressing challenge is to understand the causal mechanisms by which climate affects phenology. We combined annual population census data and individual longitudinal data (1992-2018) on grey seals, Halicheorus grypus, to quantify the relationship between pupping season phenology and sea surface temperature. A temperature increase of 2 degrees C was associated with a pupping season advance of approximately seven days at the population level. However, we found that maternal age, rather than sea temperature, accounted for changes in pupping date by individuals. Warmer years were associated with an older average age of mothers, allowing us to explain phenological observations in terms of a changing population age structure. Finally, we developed a matrix population model to test whether our observations were consistent with changes to the stable age distribution. This could not fully account for observed phenological shift, strongly suggesting transient modification of population age structure, for example owing to immigration. We demonstrate a novel mechanism for phenological shifts under climate change in long-lived, age- or stage-structured species with broad implications for dynamics and resilience, as well as population management.

AB  - Introduced species can have profound impacts on communities by displacing and consuming native organisms. The intertidal communities in the Gulf of Maine have been radically altered through a suite of invasions in the early 1800s, including the herbivorous snail Littorina littorea and the omnivorous European green crab Carcinus maenas leading to morphological and distributional changes in two native gastropod grazers (Littorina saxatilis and Littorina obtusata). Green crabs and native cancrid crabs occupy the mid to low intertidal zones, leaving the high intertidal zones relatively free from crab predation pressure. However, a more recent invasion in the 1980s by the intertidal omnivorous Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus, has eliminated this predator-free zone in the high intertidal. This invasion is of particular concern to populations of L. saxatilis, which were relegated to the high intertidal through combined competition and predation pressure by L. littorea and C. maenas. In order to quantify the potential impact of H. sanguineus on native snails, we conducted both field and lab experiments, testing the susceptibility of different sized snails to predation by introduced crabs. Additionally, we measured the distribution, abundance, and morphology of intertidal snails and crabs. Smaller snails of all species were the most susceptible to predation, although susceptibility differed among snail species and predation capabilities differed among crab species. L. saxatilis was the most vulnerable snail species to predation, with 73 and 64% of the population susceptible to large H. sanguineus and small C. maenas, respectively, while >96% of the L. littorea population was resistant to predation. L. saxatilis has been relegated to the high intertidal where there is high abiotic stress and poor-quality food, but until the invasion of H. sanguineus, there was little predation risk. This added predation pressure may further threaten populations of L. saxatilis, especially as the upper intertidal becomes more hostile with increasing temperatures and possible species introductions.

AB  - Understanding the consequences of global change for animal movement is a major issue for conservation and management. In particular, habitat fragmentation generates increased densities of linear landscape features that can impede movements. While the influence of these features on animal movements has been intensively investigated, they may also play a key role at broader spatial scales (e.g. the home range scale) as resources, cover from predators/humans, corridors/barriers or landmarks. How space use respond to varying densities of linear features has been mostly overlooked in large herbivores, in contrast to studies done on predators. Focusing on large herbivores should provide additional insights to understand how animals solve the trade-off between energy acquisition and mortality risk. Here, we investigated the role of anthropogenic (roads and tracks) and natural (ridges, valley bottoms and forest edges) linear features on home range features in five large herbivores. We analysed an extensive GPS monitoring database of 710 individuals across nine populations, ranging from mountain areas mostly divided by natural features to lowlands that were highly fragmented by anthropogenic features. Nearly all of the linear features studied were found at the home range periphery, suggesting that large herbivores primarily use them as landmarks to delimit their home range. In contrast, for mountain species, ridges often occurred in the core range, probably related to their functional role in terms of resources and refuge. When the density of linear features was high, they no longer occurred predominantly at the home range periphery, but instead were found across much of the home range. We suggest that, in highly fragmented landscapes, large herbivores are constrained by the costs of memorising the spatial location of key features, and by the requirement for a minimum area to satisfy their vital needs. These patterns were mostly consistent in both males and females and across species, suggesting that linear features have a preponderant influence on how large herbivores perceive and use the landscape.

AB  - Dental microwear texture (DMT) analysis is used to differentiate abrasive dental wear patterns in many species fed different diets. Because DMT parameters all describe the same surface, they are expected to correlate with each other distinctively. Here, we explore the data range of, and correlations between, DMT parameters to increase the understanding of how this group of proxies records wear within and across species. The analysis was based on subsets of previously published DMT analyses in guinea pigs, sheep, and rabbits fed either a natural whole plant diet (lucerne, grass, bamboo) or pelleted diets with or without added quartz abrasives (guinea pigs and rabbits: up to 45 days, sheep: 17 months). The normalized DMT parameter range (P4: 0.69 +/- 0.25; M2: 0.83 +/- 0.16) and correlation coefficients (P4: 0.50 +/- 0.31; M2: 0.63 +/- 0.31) increased along the tooth row in guinea pigs, suggesting that strong correlations may be partially explained by data range. A comparison between sheep and guinea pigs revealed a higher DMT data range in sheep (0.93 +/- 0.16; guinea pigs: 0.47 +/- 0.29), but this did not translate into more substantial correlation coefficients (sheep: 0.35 +/- 0.28; guinea pigs: 0.55 +/- 0.32). Adding rabbits to an interspecies comparison of low abrasive dental wear (pelleted lucerne diet), the softer enamel of the hypselodont species showed a smaller data range for DMT parameters (guinea pigs 0.49 +/- 0.32, rabbit 0.19 +/- 0.18, sheep 0.78 +/- 0.22) but again slightly higher correlations coefficients compared to the hypsodont teeth (guinea pigs 0.55 +/- 0.31, rabbits 0.56 +/- 0.30, sheep 0.42 +/- 0.27). The findings suggest that the softer enamel of fast-replaced ever-growing hypselodont cheek teeth shows a greater inherent wear trace consistency, whereas the harder enamel of permanent and non-replaced enamel of hypsodont ruminant teeth records less coherent wear patterns. Because consistent diets were used across taxa, this effect cannot be ascribed to the random overwriting of individual wear traces on the more durable hypsodont teeth. This matches literature reports on reduced DMT pattern consistency on harder materials; possibly, individual wear events become more random in nature on harder material. Given the species-specific differences in enamel characteristics, the findings suggest a certain species-specificity of DMT patterns.

AB  - Identifying food web linkages between biocontrol agents of invasive plants and native species is crucial for predicting indirect non-target effects. Biocontrol insects can integrate into food webs within recipient habitats and influence native insects through apparent competition (altering shared natural enemies) or density-mediated exploitation competition (changing density of native plants). However, whether and how trait-mediated exploitation competition (modifying native plant chemicals and volatiles profiles) can produce indirect non-target effects remains largely overlooked, despite plant phenotypic responses to insect herbivory being common and widely documented.
   The flea beetle Agasicles hygrophila was introduced into China for management of alligator weed Alternanthera philoxeroides, but it also attacks the native congener sessile joyweed Alternanthera sessilis, which may cause indirect non-target effects on the native tortoise beetle Cassida piperata that also feeds on sessile joyweed. Here, we examined the relationships among abundances of the flea beetle and tortoise beetle, and coverage of sessile joyweed in the field. Then, we investigated the impact of flea beetle herbivory on tortoise beetle development and oviposition, as well as on sessile joyweed primary metabolites and leaf volatiles.
   Tortoise beetle abundance was not related to sessile joyweed coverage, but they were less abundant on plants with more flea beetles in the field survey, and produced fewer offspring on plants with more prior flea beetle damage in the field cage experiment. Tortoise beetle development was inhibited by prior flea beetle herbivory in bioassays in enemy-free conditions and they preferred to oviposit on sessile joyweed that had experienced little or no flea beetle damage. Flea beetle herbivory decreased sessile joyweed foliar glucose and protein, and substantially changed its leaf volatile blend.
   Synthesis. Our results show that the flea beetle has major indirect non-target effects on the tortoise beetle through trait-mediated exploitation competition, rather than apparent competition or density-mediated exploitation competition. Our results demonstrate a new example for indirect non-target effects of biocontrol agents. Furthermore, our results indicate that minor brief negative impacts of biocontrol agents on non-target plants might propagate to higher trophic levels and such negative impacts can strengthen with increasing intensity of the direct non-target effect.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AR) represents a global threat in human and veterinary medicine. In that regard, AR proliferation and dissemination in agricultural soils after manure application raises concerns on the enrichment of endogenous soil bacterial population with allochthonous antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Natural resilience of agricultural soils and background concentrations of ARGs play key roles in the mitigation of AR propagation in natural environments. In the present study, we carried out a longitudinal sampling campaign for two crop vegetation periods to monitor spatial and temporal changes in the abundance of seven clinically relevant ARGs (sul1, ermB, vanA, aph(3')-IIa, aph(3')-IIIa, bla(TEM-1) and tet(W)) and ribosomal 16S RNA. The absolute and relative abundances of the selected ARGs were quantified in total community DNA extracted from agricultural (manured and non-manured) and forest soils, fresh pig faeces and manure slurry. We observed that ARG concentrations return to background levels after manure-induced exposure within a crop growing season, highlighting the resilience capacity of soil. Naturally occurring high background concentrations of ARGs can be found in forest soil in due distance under low anthropogenic influences. It was observed that pesticide application increases the concentrations of three out of seven ARGs tested (ermB, aph(39-IIIa and tet(W)). Moreover, we noticed that the absolute abundances of sul1, vartA, ermB and blu(TEM-1) resistance genes show an increase by 100- to 10,000- fold, from maturation of fresh pig faeces to manure. Outcomes of our study suggest that agricultural soil environments show a strong capacity to alleviate externally induced disturbances in endogenous ARG concentrations. Naturally occurring high concentrations of ARGs are present also in low human impacted environments represented by the indigenous resistorne. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Increases in drought frequency in combination with overgrazing may result in degradation of (semi-) arid ecosystems. Facilitative interactions between plants are a key mechanism in preventing degradation, but it is poorly understood how they respond to increased stress by combined drought and herbivory. In this study, we used an ecohydrological model, to simulate the plant growth of two plant species interacting with each other under different rainfall and herbivory pressure scenarios. The functional traits of the two modeled plants were based on a prior field experiment in southeastern Spain, in which an unpalatable "nurse" species protected a palatable protege' species from herbivory. Moreover, the nurse species was more drought-resistant; that is, it had a lower wilting point, whereas the protege species had a higher optimal growth rate. Firstly, we investigated the coexistence of the two plant species growing under a single limiting resource, focusing on the effect of intra-seasonal rainfall variability. We found that longer periods without rainfall within the wet season resulted in stable coexistence, whereas nearly constant rainfall led to competitive exclusion of the protege by the nurse species. Secondly, we investigated how plant interactions varied along our studied gradients. Using the neighbor effect intensity and importance indices, we found that competitive effects increased with more constant rainfall. Moreover, higher herbivory rates resulted in increased facilitative effects of the nurse on the protege species, but facilitative effects could only prevail over competitive effects under currently observed or higher intra-seasonal rainfall variability. This study highlights the relevance of intra-seasonal rainfall variability in explaining coexistence of species in dryland ecosystems and shows that increasing intra-seasonal rainfall variability or herbivory pressure can result in more facilitative effects from a nurse species. This information is crucial to obtain a better insight into the long-term coexistence of species, and the resulting stability of dryland ecosystems in response to future climate change.

AB  - Conservation breeding programs are increasingly used as recovery actions for wild animals; bringing founders into captivity to rear captive populations for future reintroduction into the wild. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature recommends that founders should come from genetically close populations and should have sufficient genetic diversity to avoid mating among relatives. Genomic data are highly informative for evaluating founders due to their high resolution and ability to capture adaptive divergence, yet, their application in that context remains limited. Woodland caribou are federally listed as a Species at Risk in Canada, with several populations facing extirpation, such as those in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta and British Columbia (BC). To prevent local extirpation, Jasper National Park (JNP) is proposing a conservation breeding program. We examined single nucleotide polymorphisms for 144 caribou from 11 populations encompassing a 200,000(2) km area surrounding JNP to provide information useful for identifying appropriate founders for this program. We found that this area likely hosts a caribou metapopulation historically characterized by high levels of gene flow, which indicates that multiple sources of founders would be appropriate for initiating a breeding program. However, population structure and adaptive divergence analyses indicate that JNP caribou are closest to populations in the BC Columbia range, which also have suitable genetic diversity for conservation breeding. We suggest that collaboration among jurisdictions would be beneficial to implement the program to promote recovery of JNP caribou and possibly other caribou populations in the surrounding area, which is strategically at the periphery of the distribution of this endangered species.

AB  - China is rich in goat breeding resources. Officially recognized local goat breeds are mainly distributed in agro-ecological regions. The population structure and matrilineal origin of native Chinese goats can be used to formulate protection and utilization strategies for these genetic resources. In this study, the genetic structure and maternal origin of native Chinese goats were investigated using mtDNA D-loop sequences. A total of 329 goat samples from 25 Chinese indigenous goat populations and five introduced goat breeds from abroad were collected; these populations were distributed in four ecogroups designated as Southwest, South-central, the North China Plain, and Foreign-ecogroup. A larger average number of nucleotide differences and richer nucleotide diversity were observed in South-central and Foreign-ecogroup, whereas these were lower in Southwest. The 216 haplotypes divided into several haplogroups, of which HapA contained 99 haplotypes distributed in Southwest, the North China Plain, and Foreign-ecogroup with high frequency (0.53-0.77), whereas the frequency of HapA in South-central was <0.09. HapB was mostly found in South-central (0.5538) and was distributed to the North China Plain (0.2667), while it was rare in Southwest (<0.08) and Foreign-ecogroup (<0.07). According to the estimation of kinship and ancestry, HapA had five ancestors (A2, A3, A5, A10, and A12), HapB had a single maternal ancestor (A8), and HapC had two maternal ancestors (A1 and A4). This study showed that native Chinese goat breeds were mainly divided into three haplogroups (HapA, HapB, and HapC) and goat populations have expanded in the ecological regions.

AB  - Climate change and escalating land-use transformations pose a significant threat to global biodiversity by disrupting natural habitats. The Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus), a near-threatened species, faces various pressures across its Asian range. This study employs a niche modeling approach to assess suitable habitats for the Asiatic wild ass at both the global population and sub-population levels. The analysis integrates the impacts of climate scenarios and land use change across three temporal periods: past, present, and future. To investigate the uncertainty of climate models for the Asiatic wild ass habitat, we used two climate models, CMIP5 and CMIP6, at both global and sub-population levels. Niche overlap models were developed to examine patterns of niche similarity among sub-populations. The results demonstrate a severe decline in both suitable habitat area and the number of viable patches for all sub-populations. Projections reveal that the Mongolian wild ass and Indian wild ass endure the highest levels of isolation and habitat loss, alongside the extinct Syrian wild ass. Sub-population models often predict larger distributions compared to global population models using the same inputs. The outputs of the models indicate a severe decline in suitable habitat, underscoring the necessity of accounting for both ecological and conservation perspectives to understand species distribution dynamics. Our study highlights the need to consider both global population and sub-population levels in climate change assessments. These models provide essential guidance for conservation strategies by identifying suitable habitats and sites for reintroduction. Identifying habitat patches as refuges for large herbivores amidst land-use changes and climate fluctuations is crucial. Incorporating these patches into conservation planning is imperative for preserving biodiversity.

AB  - The Persian fallow deer or Mesopotamian fallow Deer (Dama mesopotamica, Brook 1875), a species of significant ecological importance, had faced the threat of extinction in Iran. One conservation strategy involved the translocation of Persian deer to enclosed areas across Iran, where they were afforded protection from external threats and provided with essential care by human caretakers. While human caretakers diligently attend to their needs and mitigate external threats, climate variables may now become critical factors affecting population dynamics in enclosed areas. This study aims to assess the similarity in climate niches between the original area (Dez and Karkheh) of the Persian deer species and 11 newly enclosed areas. To achieve this, we employed climate data and ecological niche modeling (ENM) techniques to assess the variations in climate among 12 areas. We utilized the environmental equivalency test to determine whether the environmental spaces of area pairs exhibit significant differences and whether these spaces are interchangeable. Extrapolation analyses were also constructed in the next steps to explore climatic conditions in original fallow deer habitats that are non-analogous to those in other parts of Iran. Our results reveal significant disparities in climate conditions between the original and all translocated areas. Based on observations of population growth in specific enclosed areas where translocated deer populations have thrived, we hypothesize that the species may demonstrate a non-equilibrium distribution in Iran. Consequently, these new areas could potentially be regarded as part of the species' potential climate niche. Extrapolation analysis showed that for a significant portion of Iran, extrapolation predictions are highly uncertain and potentially unreliable for the translocation of Persian fallow deer. However, the primary objective of translocation efforts remains the establishment of self-sustaining populations of Persian deer capable of thriving in natural areas beyond enclosed areas, thus ensuring their long-term survival and contributing to preservation efforts. Evaluating the success of newly translocated species requires additional time, with varying levels of success observed. In cases where the growth rate of the species in certain enclosed areas falls below expectations, it is prudent to consider climate variables that may contribute to population declines. Furthermore, for future translocations, we recommend selecting areas with climate similarities to regions where the species has demonstrated growth rates.

AB  - Polygynous males allocate substantial resources to sexual traits and behaviours to improve their chances of winning competitions for mates often at the cost of body maintenance. However, the degree to which males experience these trade-offs can be influenced by external conditions. Studies are needed that assess whether polygynous male resource allocation decisions about life history traits are density dependent. We tested for an influence of density on age-specific life history traits in male southern elephant seals, Mirounga leonina, using a 34-year data set collected at Marion Island. Specifically, we determine whether life history varied with density-related factors for survival, improved breeding success (measured as social status) and recruitment age. This was done by selecting linear models that tested biological hypotheses about density-dependent covariates related to competition intensity during breeding and natal conditions, while accounting for known intrinsic effects such as age and social status. Baseline mortalities were higher for males that had accumulated above average reproductive costs for their age than males with below average costs. This reproductive cost was determined by the number of females per harem relative to the population average. Thus, males likely allocated more resources to reproduction and less to body maintenance at all ages when defending and servicing relatively large harems, and this cost was compounding for males that dominated large harems at a young age. Males born in years with few pups were more likely to be dominant breeders and recruit at an earlier age than males born in years with many pups. Thus, breeding success and recruitment age likely depended on the population density experienced during early life, suggesting lasting effects of natal conditions in a long-lived animal. We show how density-dependent factors interact with intrinsic determinants of resource allocation to determine variation in polygynous male life history with long-term consequences.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Alpine meadow ecosystem are undergoing the divergent successions under the influence of global climate warming and overgrazing by herbivores, which may profoundly impact the ecohydrology function of alpine meadow ecosystem. However, few studies reported the effects of the divergent successions on ecohydrological process of alpine meadow. Here, we report an in situ experiment to examine the effects of the divergent successions on soil pore structure, infiltration rate and evapotranspiration of the two types of divergent-succession meadows (the shrub-encroached meadow and the severely degraded meadow), compared to the normal alpine meadow. Results showed that both the shrub-encroached meadow and the severely degraded meadow significantly reduced the dominant Kobresia spp. (Cyperaceae family) coverage, soil compactness, and belowground biomass, but significantly increased soil non-capillary porosity (P < 0.05) compared to the normal alpine meadow. Soil infiltration rate was significantly negatively correlated with Kobresia spp. coverage, soil compactness and belowground biomass, while significantly positively correlated with soil non-capillary porosity (P < 0.05). Therefore, the shrub-encroached meadow and the severely degraded meadow increased soil infiltration rates not only by reducing the dominated Kobresia spp. (Cyperaceae family) coverage and belowground biomass, but also by increasing soil non-capillary porosity. Compared with the normal alpine meadow, the cumulative infiltration and evapotranspiration increased by 245.25% and 45.19% in the shrub-encroached meadows, and increased by 208.23% and 29.95% in the severely degraded meadow. However, short-term grazing exclusion presented little effect on soil infiltration rate in alpine meadows. Overall, the divergent successions of alpine meadows had a greater impact on soil water replenishment and evapotranspiration than the short-term grazing exclusion. These findings can help to better understand the impacts of the divergent community succession on the ecohydrological process in alpine grassland ecosystem.

AB  - Mushrooms are a little known source of food for large herbivores, but are of high quality because of their high protein content and digestibility. Approximately 50 epigeous and hypogeous mushroom and lichen species have been identified in the diet of cervids so far using macro remains. Our main objective was to determine which mushroom species are consumed by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) using a molecular approach. We collected 114 fecal samples from deer harvested in 2014 and 2015 on Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada), extracted total DNA from feces, and amplified fungal DNA specifically via polymerase chain reaction. Amplified fungi DNA was then sequenced with the Illumina method to identify mushroom species consumed by deer. Our results revealed that deer harvested consumed up to 4979 fungal species, including 580 species that appeared to be consumed directly. Adults tended to consume a higher mushroom diversity than juveniles, and mushroom diversity consumed by deer was much higher in 2015 than 2014. Adult females consumed a higher mushroom diversity than males, especially lactating females. Our results contribute to the understanding of the role of mushrooms and their large diversity in white-tailed deer diet.

AB  - Pest management based on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated site-specific mutations is an effective and environmentally safer strategy to suppress the pest population. However, the potential of this approach is yet to be tested on many important agricultural pests such as Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae), a fit candidate for area-wide pest management. Therefore, in the present study, 2 spermatogenesis-related genes viz. Testis-specific zinc finger protein (topi) and Testis-specific serine protein kinase 1 (Tssk1) of B. dorsalis were edited to impart male sterility and its impact on further progeny. In this regard, topi and Tssk1 mutant populations deposited significantly fewer eggs per day (6.12 +/- 0.36 and 3.60 +/- 0.24, respectively) as compared to the control (11.16 +/- 0.58 eggs per day). About the hatching rate, the above trend was observed, topi (44.51) and Tssk1 (30.04) as compared to the control (73.96). Furthermore, the total number of viable offspring for topi and Tssk1 populations decreased as a result of the cumulative progeny production ten days after the post-mating phase. It suggests that topi and Tssk1 from B. dorsalis could be potential targets for imparting male sterility in B. dorsalis.

AB  - Native shrubs facilitate the establishment of oak seedlings in the opencast coal mines rehabilitated to pastures in Northern Spain, under a Mediterranean sub-humid climate. We evaluate soil changes as one of the possible facilitative effects of nurse shrubs. We hypothesize that nurse shrubs on mining soils can improve edaphic properties directly and indirectly by reducing the negative effects of trampling and grazing by ungulates. Thus, we assessed the combined effects of nurse shrubs (plots with vs without shrubs) and grazing (plots with vs without a fence for preventing browsing and trampling) upon soil properties in a reclaimed coal mine. Chemical properties such as electrical conductivity, K+, cation exchange capacity, and C/N ratio reached higher values beneath shrubs' canopies, so did total organic matter, total N, total organic C, total P, available P, and Mg2+ under shrubs but only with grazing. In contrast, pH was higher outside the shrubs; also Ca2+, though only in the absence of grazing. With grazing, Na+ decreased under shrubs. Among physical properties, bulk density increased and porosity decreased only in grazed plots, whereas sand content increased under shrubs in the grazed plots, and clay decreased in such locations. Water holding capacity and available water were the highest in ungrazed areas. Overall, we found that shrubs have a positive direct effect on soil fertility, especially relevant in grazed areas because nurse shrubs and grazing have synergistic effects, and a positive indirect effect on physical properties because they attenuate negative effects of grazing, particularly soil compaction, by reducing livestock and wild ungulates trampling. Therefore, these results demonstrate how nurse shrubs contribute to soil amelioration, helping to facilitate plant establishment in reclaimed mines, which has relevant restoration im-plications for pasture and forest recovery.

AB  - Nearshore coastal waters off Northumberland, UK, are important habitats for marine megafauna including marine mammals and seabirds. The area also features extensive anthropogenic activities including shipping, marine renewables development, fisheries, and tourism. Meanwhile there is lack of baseline data on odontocete occurrence to allow assessment of the potential impact from human disturbance. A recent increase in the number of sightings of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the area has provided impetus for new data to inform conservation managers and policy makers. To provide this information, acoustic data were collected using broadband passive acoustic recorders at three sites (Druridge Bay, Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, and St Mary's Island) off the Northumberland coast and analyzed to identify species-specific click trains of common bottlenose dolphin, white-beaked dolphin (Lagenorhynchus albirostris) and harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Detection data were modelled for each species as detection-positive hours (DPH) using Generalized Additive Models with Generalized Estimating Equations (GAM-GEE) to investigate the effects of environmental covariates, including day of year, diel phase, lunar phase, salinity, year, month and sea surface temperature, and their interaction with location. A total of 20,845 h were recorded during the study resulting in a total of 1660, 71, and 1111 DPH identified for bottlenose dolphin, white-beaked dolphin and porpoise, respectively. The final model for bottlenose dolphins retained all covariates except tidal index and an interaction between location and day of year after model selection and all covariates in the final model were significant. The final model for white-beaked dolphin retained month, year, location, diel index, temperature, lunar index and interactions between location and diel index and all covariates except lunar index were significant. The final model for porpoise retained all covariates and interactions between location and diel phase, day of year, lunar index, and salinity, however, salinity and the interaction between location and lunar index were not significant. Bottlenose dolphin clicks were detected in the area year-round but with two peak periods in occurrence coinciding with May and late September; white-beaked dolphin clicks were detected predominantly in July and August; and porpoise clicks were present year-round but with much greater probability of detection at the Druridge Bay site, where there were peaks in winter and in September. The results of this study provide important information for conservation and management actions that may be needed to reduce anthropogenic pressures on odontocetes in UK waters.

AB  - Human disturbance and development are fragmenting landscapes, limiting the ability of organisms to freely move to meet their survival and reproductive needs. Simultaneously, extreme weather events-such as tropical cyclones, megafires, and heatwaves-pose a major threat to survival and may require animals to rapidly move to escape. As the dual forces of landscape fragmentation and extreme weather events continue to intensify, researchers urgently need to develop an understanding of the synergistic effects of these forces on animal mobility and survival. Here, we present a case study on pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) that undertook extraordinary long-distance movements (up to 399 km) to escape a once-in-two-decades extreme snowstorm in the Red Desert, WY, USA. Although Wyoming is a seemingly underdeveloped landscape, high fence density and two major highways in the region exposed pronghorn to novel barriers that delayed movement, restricted habitat access, and ultimately hindered their ability to escape extreme snow accumulation. The synergistic effects of movement barriers and extreme weather increased mortality rates by 3.7-fold such that over 50% of GPS-monitored pronghorn perished. These findings highlight the critical need to study escape movements and prioritize connectivity planning to curtail mass mortality events and ensure population persistence.

AB  - The southern elephant seal (SES; Mirounga leonina) has a circumpolar distribution, breeding mainly on sub-Antarctic islands and making long trips between breeding or molting and foraging areas. Most individuals from colonies in the South Shetland Islands (western Antarctic Peninsula; WAP) are distributed in Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA). Despite these protected habitats, pollutants can reach such remote areas far away from emission sources, affecting local fauna. To assess possible mercury (Hg) contamination in SES, we analyzed skin samples collected from free-ranging molting individuals using the remote biopsy PAXARMS system in Isla 25 de Mayo/King George Island (62 & DEG;15 & PRIME;S, 58 & DEG;39 & PRIME;W; ASPA 132). Hairless skin samples were analyzed to determine total-Hg (THg) concentrations, which ranged between 145 ng/g and 1,915 ng/g (M = 730, SD = 388 ng/g), showing significant differences between sexes, with adult-females having higher concentrations (range = 306-1,915, M = 859, SD = 427 ng/g dw) than subadult-males (range = 145-1,645, M = 629, SD = 329 ng/g dw). These differences may be explained mainly by feeding-niche partitioning between sexes. Females prefer mesopelagic prey or prey associated with sea-ice in the WAP, which are enriched in methylmercury. These results provide insight regarding Hg contamination in top Antarctic predators like SES, and the need to monitor for potential effects of Hg contamination in Antarctic marine mammals.

AB  - Simple Summary Jianchang Black goats are one of the indigenous black goat breeds in China. They are known for their crude feed tolerance but have a low growth rate and small body size. However, little is known about the genetic composition of Jianchang Black goats. The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the genetic composition of this breed by conducting multiple population genetic analyses. Our results revealed that Jintang Black and Yunshang Black goats showed a close genetic relationship with a non-negligible amount of gene flows but were genetically distant from Jianchang Black goats. Jianchang Black goats generally showed moderate inbreeding levels. Importantly, we identified several putatively selected genes that may be potentially related to immunity, behavior, and reproduction in this breed. The current study provides valuable references and genomic resources for the future breeding of Jianchang Black goats. Understanding the genetic composition of indigenous goats is essential to promote the scientific conservation and sustainable utilization of these breeds. The Jianchang Black (JC) goat, a Chinese native breed, is solid black and exhibits crude feed tolerance, but is characterized by a low growth rate and small body size. Based on the whole-genome sequencing data for 30 JC, 41 Jintang Black (JT), and 40 Yunshang Black (YS) goats, and 21 Bezoar ibexes, here, we investigated the genetic composition of JC goats by conducting analyses of the population structure, runs of homozygosity (ROH), genomic inbreeding, and selection signature. Our results revealed that JT and YS showed a close genetic relationship with a non-negligible amount of gene flows but were genetically distant from JC, apart from Bezoars. An average of 2039 ROHs were present in the autosomal genome per individual. The ROH-based inbreeding estimates in JC goats generally showed moderate values ranging from 0.134 to 0.264, mainly due to rapid declines in the effective population size during recent generations. The annotated genes (e.g., IL2, IL7, and KIT) overlapping with ROH islands were significantly enriched in immune-related biological processes. Further, we found 61 genes (e.g., STIM1, MYO9A, and KHDRBS2) under positive selection in JC goats via three complementary approaches, which may underly genetic adaptations to local environmental conditions. Our findings provided references for the conservation and sustainable utilization of JC goats.

AB  - The ongoing "toilet revolution" in China provides new opportunities to improve the rural living environment and sanitation, and the introduction of new sanitation facilities such as urine diverting composting toilets (UDCTs) is conducive to the effective treatment and resource utilization of feces. This study revealed the degradation performance and microbial community dynamics of UDCTs and clarified the influence mechanism of fecal volume in aerobic composting treatment. The results showed that UDCTs could effectively decompose human feces, with an organic matter degradation rate of 25% 30%. The temperature, water content, NH4+-N and nutrient accumulation were higher in the high fecal volume treatment than in the low fecal volume treatment. Bacterial community composition and structure in UDCTs varied with composting stage and fecal volume. The diversity and richness of bacterial community in compost were changed with different fecal volumes, but the dominant groups were similar. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that nitrogen and organic carbon were the main drivers of bacterial community changes during composting. Highly nutritious and non-phytotoxic compost products were suitable for agronomic uses. Based on these results, UDCTs can be an effective way to solve the problem of fecal pollution in rural areas, and fecal dosage is a potential influencing factor in the operation and maintenance of composting systems.

AB  - Pre-dispersal seed mortality caused by premature fruit drop is a potentially important source of plant mortality, but one which has rarely been studied in the context of tropical forest plants. Of particular interest is premature fruit drop triggered by enemies, which-if density dependent-could contribute to species coexistence in tropical forest plant communities. We used a long-term (31 year) dataset on seed and fruit fall obtained through weekly collections from a network of seed traps in a lowland tropical forest (Barro Colorado Island, Panama) to estimate the proportion of seeds prematurely abscised for 201 woody plant species. To determine whether enemy attack might contribute to premature fruit drop, we tested whether plant species abscise more of their fruit prematurely if they (a) have attributes hypothesised to be associated with high levels of enemy attack and (b) are known to be attacked by one enemy group (insect seed predators). We also tested (c) whether mean rates of premature fruit drop for plant species are phylogenetically conserved. Overall rates of premature fruit drop were high in the plant community. Across all species, 39% of seeds were abscised before completing their development. Rates of premature seed abscission varied considerably among species and could not be explained by phylogeny. Premature seed abscission rates were higher in species which are known to host pre-dispersal insect seed predators and species with attributes that were hypothesised to make them more susceptible to attack by pre-dispersal enemies, namely species which (a) have larger seeds, (b) have a greater average height, (c) have temporally predictable fruiting patterns and (d) are more abundant at the study site. Synthesis. Premature fruit drop is likely to be a major source of seed mortality for many plant species on Barro Colorado Island. It is plausible that pre-dispersal seed enemies, such as insect seed predators, contribute to community-level patterns of premature fruit drop and have the potential to mediate species coexistence through stabilising negative density dependence. Our study suggests that the role of pre-dispersal enemies in structuring tropical plant communities should be considered alongside the more commonly studied post-dispersal seed and seedling enemies.

AB  - Invasive mammalian herbivores can have significant unwanted impacts on indigenous ecosystems and production landscapes. Their impacts are often mitigated using sustained lethal control or eradication. If eradication is the chosen option, it is critical to confirm where the pest population is distributed and prove that eradication has been achieved following the removal intervention. This form of pest management requires robust and quantitative estimates of surveillance. We compared the detection probabilities, derived surveillance system sensitivities (under standardized conditions), and cost of surveillance for four survey methods for invasive Bennett's wallabies (Notamacropus rufogriseus) in South Island, New Zealand: helicopter surveys with observers, helicopter surveys using a thermal imaging camera, a ground hunter with detector dogs, and camera traps. We found camera traps and ground hunters with dogs were the most sensitive surveillance methods (82% and 45% chance of detecting a wallaby assuming full search coverage of a 100-ha area, respectively) and were most cost-effective (62% and 85% cheaper than helicopter surveys with observers, respectively). However, although these methods are useful for surveying small areas (similar to 1000 ha or less), capacity and time issues make them impractical for surveying large areas. The helicopter-based methods will likely be more suitable for monitoring large areas (e.g., 10,000-50,000 ha) that need to be completed more rapidly than could be achieved using ground-based methods. The model that we used for evaluating detection probability and surveillance sensitivity for different survey methods is highly applicable for managing a wide range of mammalian pests and confidently declaring their absence from an area.

AB  - Studies in ecology, evolution, and conservation often rely on noninvasive samples, making it challenging to generate large amounts of high-quality genetic data for many elusive and at-risk species. We developed and optimized a Genotyping-in-Thousands by sequencing (GT-seq) panel using noninvasive samples to inform the management of invasive Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) in Haida Gwaii (Canada). We validated our panel using paired high-quality tissue and noninvasive fecal and hair samples to simultaneously distinguish individuals, identify sex, and reconstruct kinship among deer sampled across the archipelago, then provided a proof-of-concept application using field-collected feces on SGang Gwaay, an island of high ecological and cultural value. Genotyping success across 244 loci was high (90.3%) and comparable to that of high-quality tissue samples genotyped using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (92.4%), while genotyping discordance between paired high-quality tissue and noninvasive samples was low (0.50%). The panel will be used to inform future invasive species operations in Haida Gwaii by providing individual and population information to inform management. More broadly, our GT-seq workflow that includes quality control analyses for targeted SNP selection and a modified protocol may be of wider utility for other studies and systems where noninvasive genetic sampling is employed.

AB  - Islands off southern Australia once harboured three subspecies of the mainland emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae), the smaller Tasmanian emu (D. n. diemenensis) and two dwarf emus, King Island emu (D. n. minor) and Kangaroo Island emu (D. n. baudinianus), which all became extinct rapidly after discovery by human settlers. Little was recorded about their life histories and only a few historical museum specimens exist, including a number of complete eggs from Tasmania and a unique egg from Kangaroo Island. Here, we present a detailed analysis of eggs of dwarf emus, including the first record of an almost complete specimen from King Island. Our results show that despite the reduction in size of all island emus, especially the King Island emu that averaged 44% smaller than mainland birds, the egg remained similar sized in linear measurements, but less in volume and mass, and seemingly had a slightly thinner eggshell. We provide possible reasons why these phenomena occurred.

AB  - Analysis of spatiotemporal partitioning is pivotal to shed light on interspecific coexistence. Most research efforts have involved large-sized carnivores and their prey species, whereas little attention has been given to ungulate in the predator-free ecosystems. We assessed seasonal activity patterns and spatiotemporal overlap among the Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus tianschanicus) and its sympatric species through camera-trapping from October 2017 and September 2020 in Jeju Island, South Korea. Trap events when compared seasonally, roe deer show higher activity in summer (34.9%), a pronounced low in winter (14.1%), and a moderate in autumn (23.8%) and in spring (26.9%). Roe deer exhibited bimodal activity patterns and had the highest spatiotemporal overlap and composite score with sika deer (Cervus nippon). Our results are among the few available data on the interaction of sympatric species and suggest strong overlapping with sika deer. This study provides important insight into species coexistence in predator-free habitats, which would be important for management initiatives.

AB  - Seagrasses are one of the most productive marine ecosystems in the world. Posidonia oceanica, an endemic Mediterranean seagrass, is under high and constant anthropogenic and natural pressures, including climate change and the introduction of invasive species. Percnon gibbesi, a small crab with a tropical and subtropical distribution, was first reported in the Mediterranean Sea in 1999, and today is established across the entire Mediterranean Basin, inhabiting the shallow rocky infra-littoral zone. Given that P. gibbesi and P. oceanica can co-occur in the same environments, an experiment was set up to study their plant-herbivore interaction. Using two experiments at two different temperatures (19 degrees C and 25 degrees C), the incidence of herbivory on the seagrass tissues (fruits, leaves, rhizome, and whole shoot) by the invasive crab was assessed. The fruits along with the rhizome were the most consumed tissues, and the leaves of P. oceanica were the least consumed, which could be a consequence of tissue structure characteristics and/or nutrient quality. The incidence of herbivory on the leaves of P. oceanica was not affected by temperature. The herbivory pressure of the exotic crab P. gibbesi on native seagrass P. oceanica will likely be limited to a shallow bathymetric range; however, given the large scale of the invasion, the consumption of P. oceanica could become a relevant ecological issue in the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - Compensatory wetland restoration is a critical component of holistic, ecosystem-level oil spill response strategies. An important goal of restoration is to rehabilitate food webs in impacted areas, but faunal assemblages and trophic dynamics are rarely included in post-restoration monitoring or assessments of success. Different approaches to wetland restoration, including variations in construction technique, may influence faunal recovery and trophic interactions. To explore these dynamics, we compared emergent plant communities, terrestrial arthropod assemblages, and trophic interactions in restored emergent marshes that were constructed in terrace and mound configurations and in reference areas in the Lower Neches Wildlife Management Area (Texas, United States). Plant community composition differed among all habitat types, with higher diversity on terraces and in reference marshes. Terrestrial arthropod abundance was similar among habitat types, but species composition was distinctly different among habitat types, especially at the herbivore level, where four of the eight herbivore species were found in either reference or restored sites, but not in both habitat types. Herbivores (primarily beetles and planthoppers) were more abundant than detritivores (midges and flies) in all habitat types. Predator (web-building and hunting spiders) abundance and species identity were similar among habitat types. Based on stable isotope analysis, trophic relationships differed among mounds, terraces, and reference areas. Herbivore diets were more variable at the reference sites than in either restored habitat type, aligning with higher plant diversity in reference areas. In contrast, detritivore diets were more variable at restored sites, where they were likely consuming food sources such as benthic algae or sediment organic matter. Predator diets were primarily comprised of herbivores in reference areas and detritivores in restored habitats. Overall, the restoration approaches supported abundant terrestrial arthropod assemblages, but species composition was different. In addition, trophic relationships differed between restored and reference areas, in part due to unique plant species assemblages at restored and reference sites. These results suggest that ecosystem restoration strategies that introduce geomorphological heterogeneity and plant diversity are more likely to support a diverse array of species and functions.

AB  - Identifying drivers of consumer biomass patterns and community structure is complex for managed freshwater ecosystems that are sensitive to nutrients and drought. In the Florida Everglades, flow restoration is expected to reintroduce discharge across an expansive wetland, yet most research on consumers has focused on water depth and dry disturbances. Low-velocity flow can mediate nutrient availability for basal food resources, but its scaled-up effects on consumer communities remain largely untested. We quantified consumer responses to a landscape-scale flow manipulation that created discharge variability along a 2.5-km path of interconnected shallow sloughs. Over 4 yr, we repeatedly sampled macroinvertebrates, small fishes, and large predatory fishes (standard length > 8 cm) in 26 sloughs-some along a flow path experiencing pulsed water releases and others in two non-flowing reference areas. We tested the effects of antecedent discharge on consumer biomass while accounting for local nutrient concentrations (total phosphorus). Discharge increased biomass across all consumer groups, particularly in oligotrophic sloughs. Conversely, eutrophic sloughs demonstrated stronger top-down effects on small fishes and macroinvertebrates, with discharge primarily benefiting large predatory fishes. Nutrient gradients preferentially increased large fishes and caused macroinvertebrate community shifts favoring herbivorous and possibly predation-resistant taxa. Structural equation modeling similarly indicated bottom-up support from discharge but stronger top-down control in nutrient-rich sloughs. These findings demonstrate that discharge and total phosphorus interactively produce distinct consumer biomass patterns. Flow restoration in oligotrophic Everglades sloughs is hypothesized to enhance aquatic consumer biomass across trophic levels, revealing an ecological benefit to slow-flowing ecosystems not previously recognized.

AB  - Northern elephant seals Mirounga angustirostris were extirpated from California in the 19th century, and only in recent decades have they recolonized. A key demographic parameter underlying population viability is the survival of pups, from birth to weaning. We evaluated local factors acting directly on pup survival prior to weaning and basin-wide factors reflecting oceanic conditions which may impact maternal condition and behavior, using a 37 yr time series from 2 adjacent islands off central California: Southeast Farallon Island (SEFI) and West End Island (WEI). Mixed-effects logistic regression indicated that annual pup survival decreased with increasing frequency of extreme waves during January and February, which may inundate haulout locations when pups are present, and increased with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) index, reflecting increased primary productivity. Moreover, the impact of extreme waves was manifest only for WEI, which may reflect a greater risk of inundation compared to SEFI. Annual pup survival was most highly correlated with NPGO values during the 6 mo period preceding and including arrival and the pupping period (fall and winter). Our findings suggest that favorable foraging conditions for females during the 4 mo prior to hauling out led to better maternal condition, which improved pup survival. Impacts of storm surges on pup survival is of concern since the frequency and severity of storms is expected to increase in the future. To support population recovery, we recommend studies consider demographic parameters such as recruitment of females to the Farallon breeding population and to adjacent coastal California colonies.

AB  - Yongle Atoll was the largest atoll in the Xisha Islands of the South China Sea, and it was a coral reef ecosystem with important ecological and economic values. In order to better protect and manage the coral reef fish resources in Yongle Atoll, we analyzed field survey data from artisanal fishery, catches, and underwater video from 2020 to 2022 and combined historical research to explore the changes in fish species composition and community structure in Yongle Atoll over the past 50 years. The results showed that a total of 336 species of fish were found on Yongle Atoll, belonging to 17 orders and 60 families. Among them, Perciformes had the most fish species with 259 species accounting for 77.08% of the total number of species. The number of fish species in the coral reef of Yongle Atoll was exponentially correlated with its corresponding maximum length and significantly decreases with its increase. The fish community structure of Yongle Atoll changed, and the proportion of large carnivorous fish decreased significantly, while the proportion of small-sized and medium-sized fish increased. At the same time, Yongle Atoll has 18 species of fish listed on the IUCN Red List, 15 of which are large fish. The average taxonomic distinctness (Delta+, ?+) and the variation taxonomic distinctness (Lambda+, ?+) in 2020-2022 were lower than the historical data, and the number of fish orders, families, and genera in Yongle Atoll has decreased significantly, which indicates that the current coral reef fish species in Yongle Atoll have closer relatives and higher fish species uniformity. In addition, the similarity of fish species in Yongle Atoll was relatively low at various time periods, further proving that the fish community structure has undergone significant variation. In general, due to multiple impacts, such as overfishing, fishing methods, environmental changes, and habitat degradation, the fish species composition of Yongle Atoll may have basically evolved from carnivorous to herbivorous, from large fish to small fish, and from complexity to simplicity, leaving Yongle Atoll in an unstable state. Therefore, we need to strengthen the continuous monitoring of the coral reef ecosystem in Yongle Atoll to achieve the protection and restoration of its ecological environment and fishery resources, as well as sustainable utilization and management.

AB  - In the year 2012 a total of seven individuals (one bull and six cows) of European bison (Bison bonasus) were introduced to a fenced 200 ha area in a forest district (Almindingen, Island Bornholm, Denmark) in the Baltic Sea. In 2017 the herd was supplemented by introduction of another bull. The animals all originated from a population in the Polish Bialowieza forest. Faecal samples were recovered with intervals and subjected to a copro-parasitological investigation (applying egg flotation, sedimentation and Baermann technique). In addition, parasites were sampled during necropsy of animals euthanized or found dead three years after introduction. The animals carried a range of parasite types including trematodes (liver fluke Fasciola and rumen fluke), cestodes (Moniezia), nematodes (Dictyocaulus viviparus, trichurids, and other gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) including Trichostrongylus axei and Haemonchus contortus). Egg and larval morphology also suggested presence of GIN genera Nematodirus, Ostertagia and Cooperia. The trematodes did not establish a life cycle in the recipient area, as judged by examination of calves born in the new area, but the cestode and several nematode species occurred in these animals. Especially Dictyocaulus viviparus was successfully spread and occurred together with GIN at moderate to high infection intensities at most sampling points. The reproduction among bison in the herd was high during the first few years. The exact birth rate is unknown but up to 24 calves are believed to be born during the ten year study period. Mortality among adults and calves occurred and in early June 2022 the total number of live animals was 11 (seven males, three females, one calf). The possible impact of the parasite infections on the bison health and future wildlife infection status is discussed.

AB  - The arrival of a new carnivore can have important effects on local communities. While several effects of introduced alien species have been well documented, few studies have reported the ecological consequences of an expanding native species. Golden jackals (Canis aureus) are rapidly expanding their distribution in Europe, far beyond their historic range. While this raises many concerns about their potential impact on native wildlife, actual consequences are rarely recorded. Besides being a predator, the jackal is also an efficient scavenger and could function as a kleptoparasite for other predators living in areas colonized by jackals. Large felids are among the predators most vulnerable to kleptoparasitism and Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) are already known to be negatively affected by several scavengers. Here we report on the first confirmed cases of jackals scavenging on lynx kills in the Dinaric Mountains, Slovenia. We used camera traps to monitor scavengers at 65 lynx kills and recorded two cases of groups of jackals feeding on roe deer killed by lynx. To determine the potential for jackal kleptoparasitism on lynx at the continental level, we also calculated trends in the overlap in distribution ranges of both species in Europe. To date, jackals have colonized 13% of lynx range, including parts of two highly threatened populations. Finally, we highlight the potential impact of sympatric grey wolves (Canis lupus) to modulate this newly described jackal-lynx kleptoparasitic interaction.

AB  - This paper characterises current rewilding activities in the UK, through the analysis of 66 rewilding projects. Project information was obtained from online data (65 %), and direct mail data requests (35 %). The analyses showed an exponential growth in the number of new rewilding projects since 2010, with 8 % of projects started prior to 2000, and 60 % initiated after 2010. Seventy-three percent of projects involved rewilding areas of less than 1000 ha, 17 % being between 1000 and 10,000 ha, and 9 % greater than 10,000 ha. In Scotland, 80 % of the area being rewilded involved mountain, heath and bog habitats. For England the largest rewilded areas (58 %) were semi -natural or improved grasslands. Fifty-six percent of sites were formerly used for livestock farming, and 24 % for arable cultivation. A total of 72 % of sites employed tree planting, 64 % introduced herbivores, and 33 % introduced non -herbivores. The removal of sheep and cattle took place in 51 % of projects, with deer control in 33 %, wetland creation in 39 %, and the removal of artificial drainage in 36 % of projects. There was a close geographical proximity between rewilding sites and Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), with 69 % of areas being within 4 km, and only two sites greater than 8 km. Twelve project funding sources were recorded, and most projects utilised multiple funding sources. The benefits of an evidence -led and nationally co-ordinated rewilding approach were identified in relation to using well -established decision tools and frameworks to enhance future rewilding spatial planning. This would allow the development of a map of 'appropriate ' rewilding areas, based on landscape scale characteristics, national species and habitat priorities, and predicted future landscape changes. Importantly, these 'target ' areas would also be sensitive to local social, economic and agricultural contexts.

AB  - We conducted a series of studies to assess the effectiveness of an electric barrier in deterring the movements of freshwater fish. Fish responses (detections center dot individual(-1)center dot hr(-1) within the 3 m exclusion zone) were quantified for a mixed assemblage of native and nonnative fishes within 0.4 ha ponds. Additionally, we mapped the surface voltages generated by the electric barrier in a nearby stream. The electric barrier (operated at 10 kW) was effective at deterring native and invasive fishes, as > 99% of all fish detections within the exclusion zone occurred while the electric barrier was off. However, some fish detections occurred while the system was operated at full power, indicating the electric barrier was not 100% effective. A follow-up study found that fish responses differed between low (3.6 kW), medium (6.6 kW), and high (10 kW) field strengths, with smallmouth buffalo Ictiobus bubalus exhibiting a greater sensitivity to the low setting than bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and silver carp H. molitrix. Maps of the surface voltages within a nearby stream indicated that the electric barrier was strong enough to deter silver carp (> 1 V/cm). However, the surface voltages quickly dissipated upstream and downstream of the electrodes. Overall, the electric barrier appears to be an effective tool that can be used to combat the spread of invasive fishes in freshwater environments. However, more evaluations are needed to test how the system performs in different conditions and to identify whether fish of varying sizes or life stages respond similarly.

AB  - Reconciling conservation goals with sustainable resource use requires adaptive management strategies. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates global trade for species listed on Appendix II, partly by requiring member countries (parties) to ensure exports do not damage wild populations (called making positive "nondetriment findings" [NDFs]). Unfortunately, when parties find NDFs difficult, they often suspend legal trade, imposing economic costs and driving trade underground. To make it easier for parties to examine the detrimental nature of exports, we devised a spatial approach and applied it to seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) in Tamil Nadu, India, as an example. Our approach involves mapping answers to 5 key questions on species distribution (QA), pressures (QB), management measures (QC), management implementation (QD), and species' population status (QE). We gathered data from fisher interviews and published literature. Seahorse abundance was greatest in southern Palk Bay and the northern Gulf of Mannar, primarily in seagrasses and coral reefs (QA). Fishing pressure was highest in Palk Bay, primarily from bottom trawlers and dragnetters operating in shallow seahorse habitats near the coastline (QB). Management measures including a marine protected area (MPA), bottom trawl exclusion zone, and closed season were theoretically in place (QC), but their implementation was poor (QD). Fishers reported seahorse catches in 85% of the area covered by the MPA and the exclusion zone; bottom trawlers were responsible for most violations. Seahorses were also captured in Sri Lankan waters, where bottom trawling is banned. Fisher reports indicated declining seahorse catches and reduced body sizes (QE), highlighting unsustainable exploitation. Our results highlight the need for better implementation of existing management measures before a positive NDF can be made and suggest mitigation beyond bans. Such pragmatic spatial analyses can help regulate exports at sustainable levels, supporting CITES implementation for its vast range of species.

AB  - Environmental factors often limit plant establishment and survival through increased seedling mortality. Understanding plant growth and the causes of mortality can be helpful in developing solutions that enhance seeding success and improve restoration monitoring. The purpose of our research was to assess the efficacy of time lapse and motion sensing cameras for monitoring seedling height, density, and fate. We conducted this study in a salt desert shrub community in northwest Utah, USA. In spring 2017, we placed 28 cameras in fenced and unfenced plots seeded with bottlebrush squirreltail and collected hourly images of the seedlings' development for the initial four months post-seeding. The seedling attributes were recorded in-field and compared with camera images to determine accuracy and reliability. We found that the optimal period for capturing imagery occurred near the sun's zenith when shadows were minimized. We were able to detect both the timing of the plant emergence, plant height, density, growth rate, and seedling death. The average seedling height and density were underestimated by 14% and 30% between the camera and field estimates, respectively. We recognize that it could be beneficial to adjust for the effect of the date. The reduced seedling density improved the measurement accuracy through a lower visual obscurity.

AB  - One of the most difficult challenges for wildlife managers is reliably estimating wildlife populations. Camera traps combined with spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models are a popular tool for population estimation. They have limitations, however, including long data processing times. Drones with thermal imagery are an emerging tool for estimating wildlife populations, but how they compare to other methods remain poorly studied. We compared the use of camera traps and SCR models to drone surveys for estimating population densities of Sitka black-tailed deer Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis on Afognak Island, Alaska. We deployed 26 camera traps from 1 September until 6 October 2022 and individually identified males using antler characteristics, for the SCR model. At the same site we conducted three drone surveys between October and December 2022, identified sex composition and obtained deer counts. The estimated density from the SCR model was 3.7 males +/- 0.8 (SE) km-2, and 14.1 +/- 3.1 adults km-2 of clear-cut forest. Results from the drone survey produced similar estimates with 2.1 +/- 0.9 males km-2 and 13.4 +/- 1.6 adults km-2. The similarity in estimates suggests that both methods converged on an accurate representation of the population in this habitat, but these methods diverge in levels of sampling effort, duration, and financial cost. Camera traps offer further insights on behavior and home-range size but require longer data processing times, can be subject to malfunctions, and are difficult to deploy and maintain in remote areas. Drones are subject to legal restrictions, have difficulty in closed canopy habitat and can be initially costly, but they provide results faster and require less data analysis. Camera traps and drones are useful for determining population dynamics but are subject to their limitations. Wildlife managers should make survey decisions based on their specific goals, habitat type, focal species ecology and financial limitations.

AB  - In Sweden, browsing by large herbivores hampers seedling establishment and causes substantial growth losses in economically important, regenerating Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stands. In addition, suboptimal site conditions often require mechanical site preparation (MSP) to promote seedling establishment by improving substrate quality and reducing vegetation competition and pest damage. Here, we examined the interaction between herbivore exclusion fencing and regeneration method (natural, seed-sown) on sapling height and radial growth, as well as the interplay between exclusion fencing and MSP (harrowing, mounding) on the growth of planted seedlings. There was no significant interaction between regeneration method and fencing for either of the two growth variables (height, radial growth). Both regeneration techniques resulted in similar growth performance regardless of fencing. Fencing caused greater height (+17%) and radial growth (+7%), irrespective of regeneration method. A significant interaction between MSP and fencing was observed for both height and radial growth. Without fence, height and radial growth were similar in both MSP methods. With fencing, harrowing stimulated seedling height growth by 25% and radial growth by 48% compared to mounding, which exhibited similar growth patterns as mounding without a fence. Our findings highlight the interplay between MSP and herbivore exclusion and indicate that harrowing is far superior to mounding when fencing is technically and economically feasible. This study provides actionable guidance for forest managers aiming to promote Scots pine more prominently in the future.

AB  - Crepidiastrum grandicollum is a critically endangered insular endemic herb found only on two oceanic islands of the Bonin Islands in Japan, namely Chichijima Island and Anijima Island. It is explicitly threatened by herbivory pressure from introduced animals. In 2009, a conservation program for C. grandicollum was begun to ensure its future persistence. To provide further information for conservation planning, we investigated the genetic diversity of C. grandicollum using 13 novel microsatellite markers in 55 individuals from four wild populations and an ex situ living collection. Two closely related woody species were also included for interspecific comparison: seven individuals of Crepidiastrum ameristophyllum and 13 of Crepidiastrum linguifolium. The 13 markers were applicable to all three species and identified 129 alleles in total. We found a clear genetic differentiation between C. grandicollum from Anijima Island and Chichijima Island. Crepidiastrum grandicollum also had low expected heterozygosity and allelic richness in populations compared to the two closely related species. Reconstructed divergence history suggested that differentiation between the islands had occurred several thousand generations ago. We suggest separate conservation units for C. grandicollum on Anijima Island and Chichijima Island given the clear (and putatively historical) genetic differentiation, which may result in speciation in the future.

AB  - Tail breakage is an important anti-predator mechanism in snake populations, which can be used as a proxy for predation intensity as natural observations of predator-prey interactions are scarce. Frequency of tail breakage was calculated for two Iberian colubrids recently introduced in the Balearic Islands (Western Mediterranean, Spain): the Horseshoe Whip Snake (Hemorrhois hippocrepis (Linnaeus, 1758)) in Eivissa and the Ladder Snake (Zamenis scalar's (Schinz, 1812)) in Formentera. The effect of sex, life stage, dorsal coloration pattern, body length, and body condition on frequency of tail breakage and on remaining subcaudal scale pairs were analyzed and compared between the indigenous range and the invaded islands. An increase of the frequency of tail breakage with body size was found, supporting a size-related effect, which also occurs in the indigenous range. Frequency of tail breakage of H. hippocrepis was lower in Eivissa when compared with the original area, whereas in Formentera, Z. scalaris showed a higher frequency, which could be related to the different predator community on each island compared with the mainland. The study of the main ecological aspects of these recently introduced species may allow one to assess their potential impact on insular ecosystems and their indigenous biodiversity, as well as to promote future control actions in these areas previously free of snakes.

AB  - Simple Summary: People who use hiking trails may be exposed to blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis, also known as deer ticks), some of which are infected with the pathogens that cause Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. In areas that also have lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum), an added concern is acquiring the alpha-gal red meat allergy. Here, we describe an example of how such tick-related risks can be assessed at the scale of a local community, while providing a baseline for further monitoring. We used drag sampling along public trails to quantify tick abundance in June 2020-2022 at 12 study sites in the town of Nantucket, Massachusetts, USA. One of these sites was located on nearby Tuckernuck Island. Blacklegged nymphs were common at sites with moist deciduous woodlands and rare in open grasslands. For several sites, we carried out pathogen testing and found that similar to 10-20% of blacklegged nymphs on Nantucket were infected with the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. Lone star ticks were extremely common on Tuckernuck Island and rare on Nantucket Island, where they are expected to become more widespread in the future. Both tick species represent a significant threat to public health and mitigating their impact is an ongoing challenge.
   Tick-borne diseases and a tick-induced red meat allergy have become increasingly common in the northeastern USA and elsewhere. At the scale of local communities, few studies have documented tick densities or infection levels to characterize current conditions and provide a baseline for further monitoring. Using the town of Nantucket, MA, as a case study, we recorded tick densities by drag sampling along hiking trails in nature preserves on two islands. Nymphal blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis Say) were most abundant at shadier sites and least common in grasslands and scrub oak thickets (Quercus ilicifolia). Lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum L.) were common on Tuckernuck Island and rare on Nantucket Island, while both tick species were more numerous in 2021 compared to 2020 and 2022. We tested for pathogens in blacklegged nymphs at five sites over two years. In 2020 and 2021, infection levels among the four Nantucket Island sites averaged 10% vs. 19% for Borrelia burgdorferi, 11% vs. 15% for Babesia microti, and 17% (both years) for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, while corresponding levels were significantly greater on Tuckernuck in 2021. Our site-specific, quantitative approach represents a practical example of how potential exposure to tick-borne diseases can be monitored on a local scale.

AB  - In 2001 and 2002, 52 elk (Cervus canadensis; 21 males, 31 females), originally obtained from Elk Island National Park, Alberta, Canada, were transported and released into Cataloochee Valley in the northeastern portion of Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM, Park), North Carolina, USA. The annual population growth rate (lambda) was negative (0.996, 95% CI = 0.945-1.047) and predation by black bears (Ursus americanus) on elk calves was identified as an important determinant of population growth. From 2006 to 2008, 49 bears from the primary elk calving area (i.e., Cataloochee Valley) were trapped and translocated about 70 km to the southwestern portion of the Park just prior to elk calving. Per capita recruitment (i.e., the number of calves produced per adult female that survive to 1 year of age) increased from 0.306 prior to bear translocation (2001-2005) to 0.544 during years when bears were translocated (2006-2008) and lambda increased to 1.118 (95% CI = 1.096-1.140). Our objective was to determine whether per capita calf recruitment rates after bear removal (2009-2019) at Cataloochee were similar to the higher rates estimated during bear removal (i.e., long-term response) or if they returned to rates before bear removal (i.e., short-term response), and how those rates compared with recruitment from portions of our study area where bears were not relocated. We documented 419 potential elk calving events and monitored 129 yearling and adult elk from 2001 to 2019. Known-fate models based on radio-telemetry and observational data supported calf recruitment returning to pre-2006 levels at Cataloochee (short-term response); recruitment of Cataloochee elk before and after bear relocation was lower (0.184) than during bear relocation (0.492). Recruitment rates of elk outside the removal area during the bear relocation period (0.478) were similar to before and after rates (0.420). In the Cataloochee Valley, cause-specific annual calf mortality rates due to predation by bears were 0.319 before, 0.120 during, and 0.306 after bear relocation. In contrast, the cause-specific annual mortality rate of calves in areas where bears were not relocated was 0.033 after the bear relocation period, with no bear predation on calves before or during bear relocation. The mean annual population growth rate for all monitored elk was 1.062 (95% CI = 0.979-1.140) after bear relocation based on the recruitment and survival data. Even though the effects of bear removal were temporary, the relocations were effective in achieving a short-term increase in elk recruitment, which was important for the reintroduction program given that the elk population was small and vulnerable to extirpation.

AB  - Fifteen years have elapsed since the arrival of the invasive snake Hemorrhois hippocrepis to the island of Ibiza (Balearic Islands, Spain). In that time, the only endemic vertebrate, the Ibiza Wall Lizard (Podarcis pityusensis), has disappeared across half of the island, a subspecies restricted to an offshore islet has vanished, and its extinction in its native range is likely to happen in the next several years if managers do not implement conservation measures with alacrity and decisiveness. In light of these findings, our re-assessment of the IUCN extinction risk category for this lizard shows that its risk status has increased by two levels since its last assessment in 2008, from Near Threatened to Endangered. We also classify this snake as producing a Massive (MA) impact under the Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa. Lastly, we suggest six management measures to prevent the extinction of the majority of genetic and taxonomic diversity of this lizard on Ibiza, Formentera, and the numerous surrounding islets.

AB  - Gastro-intestinal parasitic nematodes are typical pathogens of mammalian herbivores. A key moment of infection by passively ingested nematodes is the contact between infective larvae and the grazing host. Yet, knowledge on dispersal dynamics of larvae infecting wild herbivores in natural environments is limited. We studied the mode and range of lateral larval movement. As study species, we used infective larvae of Ostertagia gruehneri-a parasitic nematode that can negatively affect its host, Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus). In the laboratory, reindeer faecal pats containing larvae were introduced onto soil placed either horizontally or on a slope (10 degrees), mimicking the micro-topography of High Arctic tundra. After four weeks, 939 live nematodes were recorded, of which 23% were in the soil, mostly underneath the faecal pat (20%). The remaining 3% that dispersed away from the pat did so in both sloped and flat soil. We conclude that the larvae were able to actively move from faeces to soil and that subsequent dispersal was limited and not assisted by gravity (slope). These insights reveal potential infection hotspots, providing a glimpse in the complex interplay between parasite and host.

AB  - The potential for targeted grazing for restoration through the removal of invasive species represents an effective tool for practitioners. This study examines the impact of targeted grazing across highly variable precipitation on buffelgrass, a widely introduced African grass that often escapes cultivation. We simulated targeted grazing, overgrazing, and no grazing by clipping at two intensities and not clipping in a third treatment. We did this in plots with buffelgrass invasion and documented buffelgrass size and reproduction, as well as native plant community diversity. Additionally, as a further proxy for grazing, we tracked root allocation by buffelgrass in mowed and unmowed plots for 25 months while documenting large variability in precipitation. We found that targeted grazing reduced the negative impact of buffelgrass on the native community; on the other hand, overgrazing reduced the native community diversity. Precipitation interacted with simulated grazing such that buffelgrass subjected to grazing was less tolerant to drought and future simulated herbivory after rains returned. Long-term targeted grazing may lead to reductions in buffelgrass that allow the restoration of the native plant community, which benefits the biodiversity of flora and fauna, and supports multiple uses of rangelands.

AB  - Previous human dimensions articles related to changes in perceptions about chronic wasting disease (CWD) have focused on psychological variables (e.g., risk, trust). We expanded the scope of comparison and included 27 CWD management-action variables. We obtained data from 2 mail surveys of resident deer hunters randomly sampled from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources' (IDNR) permit holders, administered first in 2012 (n = 5,663, response rate = 55%) and again in 2022 (n = 1,237, response rate = 43%). Hunters in 2022 were less aware of IDNR's management actions (e.g., increase the number of deer permits) than the 2012 hunters. Alternatively, the 2022 hunters were more supportive of actions the IDNR should pursue (e.g., use deer sharpshooting) than the 2012 hunters. Hunters in 2012 were more supportive of testing for CWD than the 2022 sample, although the differences were small. Conversely, the 2022 hunters were always more likely to believe that each IDNR action (e.g., use deer sharpshooting) was more effective than those during 2012. Statistical differences can be partially attributed to the large sample size as the average Cohen's d across all 27 items was only 0.159 (i.e., small). Overall, findings demonstrate the importance of tracking changes in beliefs over time, as such changes can influence an agency's management actions.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the true seroprevalence of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection in dairy cattle from Pakistan at the animal and herd-level. We tested 1380 dairy cattle from 451 herds and 92 water buffalo. The sera were tested by ELISA and the results were analyzed using Bayesian inference. The median posterior estimate of the herd level true BLV prevalence was 1.4%, with a 95% credible interval (CI) 0.7-3.1, whereas the median posterior estimate of the within-farm true seroprevalence was 3.8% with a 95% CI 2.8-4.8. All 92 sera collected from water buffalo were negative. Several risk factors potentially associated with seropositivity to BLV infections in Pakistan were analyzed using logistic regression model based on calculation of an odds ratio (OR). The study showed an association between seropositivity and medium herd (>= 50) size (OR = 23.57, 95% CI: 3.01-103.48). Common housing of indigenous cattle with exotic-breed cattle (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 06-2.35) or housing indigenous or their crossbred cattle with exotic-breed cattle (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.14-3.01) had no effect on the BLV seroprevalence. Similarly, common housing of cattle and water buffalo was not risk factor for increased BLV seropositivity (OR = 27.10, 95% CI: 0.63-119.34).

AB  - Resource selection and space use are important aspects of an animal's ecology and understanding these behaviors is necessary for proper wildlife management. We used mixed-effect integrated step-selection models to evaluate seasonal variation in resource selection between male and female elk (Cervus canadensis) and diel periods in central Pennsylvania, USA. Resource selection varied seasonally, between sexes, and across diel periods. These results demonstrate strong seasonal sexual segregation in resource use, and movements between habitats throughout the day, highlighting the dynamic nature of resource selection by elk and underscoring the importance of considering sexual variation at multiple temporal scales when designing ungulate management strategies. Finally, we developed habitat suitability maps for male and female elk in the Pennsylvania Elk Management Area. Wildlife ecologists and managers must consider multiple sources of variation in habitat use and resource selection, particularly for large mobile species such as elk.

AB  - Foraging behavior of cattle is a critical factor for sustainable grassland grazing. Investigating cattle's behavior under varying grazing strategies can offer valuable insights into the interactions between grazing animals and grasslands. In this study, we used a fenced grazing experiment to test the hypothesis that grazing pressure influences the grass patches by altering the foraging behavior of cattle. Cattle location trajectories were tracked using Global Positioning System collars, and livestock behavior was simultaneously observed and recorded in the field. Five machine learning models-XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Extra Trees, and CatBoost-were employed to classify cattle's behavior and to assess the impact of grazing strategies on these behaviors. The effects of grazing strategies on grassland vegetation were analyzed based on spatial remote sensing data acquired from unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The main findings were: (1) the XGBoost classification model has outperformed the others models, with an average accuracy of 0.947; (2) grazing intensity only significantly affected standing behaviors, while grazing regime significantly influenced foraging, walking, standing, ruminating, and resting behaviors; (3) increased grazing intensity had led to a larger proportion of areas with declining normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the study area; however, the proportion of areas with increased NDVI was consistently higher in rotationally grazed regions compared to that of continuously grazed areas; (4) The changes in NDVI were significantly positively correlated with foraging probability in continuously grazed plots; however, NDVI changes in lightly grazed rotational areas had a weak correlation with foraging probability. These results suggest that proper management strategies, such as rotational grazing can enhance grassland health, which provides a scientific foundation and technical support for the development and implementation of sustainable grassland management strategies.

AB  - Background Understanding connectivity is critical to the management of exploited fish stocks, but migratory dynamics of Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands region are not well-understood. In the current study, 145 Pacific halibut >= 82 cm fork length were tagged with Pop-up Archival Transmitting (PAT) tags to evaluate interannual dispersal, seasonal migration, and depth-specific habitat use. Results Endpoint locations obtained after 1 year at liberty (n = 79), fishery recoveries after 2-3 years at liberty (n = 5), and at-liberty geopositions based on light data (n = 5313 estimates from 109 fish) indicated geographically distinct movement patterns: Pacific halibut tagged in the Western and Central Aleutian Islands remained within the island groups in which the fish had been tagged; fish in the eastern Bering Sea remained in that ocean basin, moving among International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) regulatory areas and into Russian waters; those tagged south of Unimak Pass in IPHC Regulatory Area 4A displayed the greatest amount of emigration, dispersing eastward both seasonally and interannually to as far south as Washington State. Analysis of daily maximum depth and temperature data from 113 individuals demonstrated group-level variation in summer temperatures experienced by the fish and in the timing, duration, and synchrony of movement to deep-water wintering grounds. Conclusions Depth-specific habitat use was suggestive of regionally explicit migratory contingents, while interannual dispersal patterns were consistent with the existence of multiple functional spawning units. The results may guide future research to examine cross-basin connectivity in the Northern Bering Sea and provide inputs for numerical modelling of individual movements, larval advection, and recruitment analyses.

AB  - The occurrence and distribution of ten larger terrestrial mammals on the Ionian Island of Corfu were investigated from January 2020 to March 2021. The northern white-breasted hedgehog and the stone marten were found to be common, and this is probably also the case for the least weasel. The red fox was primarily found in the island's rocky northeast and although not uncommon it may be under pressure as it is often considered a pest. Wild boars were found to be present, and reproduction may occur, but the status of this species needs further investigation. The Eurasian otter was found in several areas around the island, but the data indicates that the Corfu population contains few individuals that move over large areas. We suggest strengthened protection for this species to avoid further population decline and subsequent extinction. Brown hares of unknown origins are repeatedly released on the island, and in combination with extensive hunting any genetic characteristics of the indigenous population is expected to be lost. No evidence for presence of fallow deer was found, and except for photos of single specimens this was also the case for red deer and golden jackal. All investigated species are potentially threatened by habitat loss, caused by increasing tourism, extensive development, high water out-take and, in some cases, persecution.

AB  - Free-ranging grazers are increasingly being introduced to areas of high natural value, such as wetlands. There is also growing attention that has been paid to the historical role of herbivores in shaping ecosystems and landscapes. Even though studies on the grazing of free-range horses were carried out in different regions and climates, still little is known about their habitat selection on heterogeneous marshy areas in the temperate region of Europe. The aim of this study was to investigate the habitat use by contemporary Konik horses during the growing season on the basis of three-year GPS data for a semi-feral herd kept on wetlands. Almost 68% of the occurrence of Konik horses were in open habitats. The assessment of habitat selection by the horses confirmed their strong preferences for grasslands on mid-forest dunes and forest avoidance. Konik horses somewhat preferred mowed fen meadows, but the animals displayed differences in the selection of habitat, probably depending on its humidity and weather conditions in a given year which may limit the role of grazing in protecting these communities. Horses need different habitats in wetlands such as fen meadows, forest, and grasslands on the mineral hills. This should be taken into consideration for landscape management in areas where the introduction of wild or semi-wild horse populations is planned.

AB  - The Mediterranean Sea is warming at a rate exceeding the global average, facilitating the proliferation of thermophilic non-indigenous species, a process known as tropicalization. Despite over 1000 thermophilic marine species introductions, only two non-indigenous octocorals have been documented. This study presents photographic, taxonomic and genetic evidence that a third non-indigenous octocoral, the snowflake coral, Carijoa cf. riisei, has successfully colonized Limassol, Cyprus, a maritime hub in the eastern Mediterranean. Genetic analyses suggest that the snowflake coral is likely of Indo-Pacific origin, marking a northern expansion of its known biogeographic range. The snowflake coral is a common biofouler and produces planktonic larvae that can be transported through ballast water, which have contributed to its wide distribution in tropical and sub-tropical marine environments. Characterized by rapid growth, it can overgrow and smother local benthic invertebrates, significantly altering benthic community structures in invaded areas. Detected colonies survived and grew, and within a few years, dense colonies appeared, carpeting the hard substrata at adjacent sites. This recent proliferation raises concerns that a new invasion is underway. In the eastern Mediterranean, the snowflake coral has the potential to occupy the empty ecological space created by invasive herbivorous species and transform the seascape of vulnerable barren subtidal reefs to one where marine animal forests are the dominant feature. Our findings highlight the urgent need for ecological surveys to monitor the dynamics of this invasive octocoral and its potential role in driving ecological change, providing essential insights during the early stages of invasion.

AB  - For areas at risk for African swine fever (ASF) introduction from neighboring regions, it is important for epidemic control to know how wild boar (Sus scrofa) dispersion dynamics could be used to combat the spread of ASF. In this regard, long-term information based on population genetic data makes an important contribution. We selected our study area as Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, because it had a high density of wild boars and was threatened by ASF via infected wild boars from neighboring Belgium. On an area of around 20,000 km(2), we collected almost 1,200 blood samples from 22 wild boar hunting grounds. The study area included a network of potential barriers to movement, including roads and rivers. We assessed genetic differentiation based on microsatellite data. We used 2 spatial (Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure [BAPS] and TESS) and 1 non-spatial (STRUCTURE) Bayesian model-based approaches to analyze the data. Each of the algorithms detected 4 clusters with different cluster compositions in different areas and identified the highest degrees of differentiation between hunting grounds east and west of the Rhine River, between Pfalz and Eifel-Hunsruck, and to a lesser degree between Westerwald and Taunus and between Eifel and Hunsruck. Thus, genetic evidence suggests barriers of different strength that might be helpful in a setup of complex and expensive measures against the spread of animal diseases such as ASF. The described approach could also provide valuable information for other threatened regions to contain ASF. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Introduction Climate change has led to rising atmospheric CO2 levels and temperatures, projected to double CO2 concentrations and increase temperatures by 2-5 degrees C by the end of the 21st century. These environmental changes influence plant primary and secondary metabolism, potentially altering plant-insect interactions. Herbivore performance depends on the nutritional quality of host plants, which may decline with elevated CO2 due to an increased carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio. To explore these effects, the performance of spongy moth larvae (Lymantria dispar) was assessed on oak (Quercus robur) and spruce (Picea abies) seedlings grown under varying climatic conditions. This approach compares a preferred host with a non-preferred one in the case of L. dispar, providing insight into how host plant selection may be influenced under future climate scenarios. In addition, the nun moth (Lymantria monacha), a conifer-feeding species, was also studied on the experimental spruce seedlings to facilitate a comparison with a specialist herbivore.Methods Three-year-old oak and spruce seedlings were reared for 1 year under four climate scenarios combining two CO2 levels (ambient: 410 ppm and elevated: 820 ppm) and two temperature regimes (20:15 degrees C and 25:20 degrees C). Seedlings were then processed into leaf powder diets for laboratory bioassays with larvae. Secondary metabolites in the seedlings were analyzed to assess climate-induced changes in tree composition and their effects on herbivores.Results Elevated CO2 increased the C:N ratio in both tree species, with spruce showing a higher ratio than oak. Higher temperatures led to increased nitrogen content, particularly in oak seedlings. L. dispar performed better on oak despite higher secondary metabolite concentrations, while L. monacha exhibited minimal variation in performance on spruce across climate treatments.Conclusion The combined effects of elevated CO2 levels and increased temperatures impacted plant quality; however, there were nearly no differences in the performance of Lymantria larvae. Despite the higher concentrations of secondary metabolites in the trees, the larvae were able to thrive effectively, demonstrating their resilience to environmental changes.

AB  - 1 The decay process of animal carcasses is a highly complex succession driven by abiotic and biotic variables and their interactions. As an underexplored ecological recycling process, understanding carrion decomposition associated with pandemics such as African swine fever is important for predicting the rate and post-mortem interval (PMI) variation of wild animal carcasses to improve disease management.
   2 To model PMIs of wild boar, we deployed 73 wild boar carcasses in four different forest habitat types throughout a year and monitored the decomposition process, carrion beetles and blow fly larval populations. The 601 single observations were split randomly into 501 training data and 100 validation data.
   3 A linear additive mixed model for log-transformed PMI values using the training data identified the decay stage, day of year, ambient temperature during sampling, habitat and prevalence of Oiceoptoma thoracicum (Silphidae) as predictive variables for time since death, but neither the initial body mass nor if a fresh or previous frozen carcass was used. Using the validation data, this model showed a high predictive power for log-transformed PMI values (R-2 = 0.80).
   4 This study aimed at improving the methodology of estimating the PMI of wild boar carcasses based on important abiotic and biotic environmental factors that can be easily assessed in the field. Using only a small set of predictors, including a conspicuous beetle species, allowed prediction of the mean, minimum and maximum PMI of wild boar carcasses. The strong effects of a few surrogates on PMI in our model suggest that this model can easily be transferred to wider regions of Central Europe by retraining the model with data from a broader environmental space and can thus be instrumental in assessing timing of disease introduction in areas newly affected by emerging diseases such as African swine fever.

AB  - The Bawean deer (Axis kuhlii), endemic to Bawean Island, Indonesia, is one of the world's most isolated ungulates. This study aimed to 1) identify individual males using antler morphology, 2) estimate the male population using capture-recapture modeling, and 3) estimate the number of females and fawns based on their relative frequencies in independent video detections. We deployed 30 camera traps in protected areas (45.57 km2) over 276 days (January-October 2023), accumulating 8,280 trap nights. Using the Jolly-Seber-Schwarz-Arnason model with recruitment (JSSAsecrf) in the openCR framework, we evaluated 3 detection functions and selected the model with the lowest Akaike's Information Criterion corrected for small sample size. To incorporate uncertainty from both spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR)-based male estimates and demographic ratios, we calculated confidence intervals for female, fawn, and total population sizes using nonparametric bootstrapping with 5,000 iterations. We identified 45 individual males at 12 sites. The most parsimonious model estimated male density at 2.44 +/- 0.47 deer/km(2), corresponding to 111.19 (95% CI = 76.45-161.72) males. The total population was estimated at 250.39 deer (95% CI = 156.46-352.97), including 118.97 (95% CI = 72.92-173.67) females and 20.23 (95% CI = 11.50-32.11) fawns. While male survival was high (0.93 +/- 0.02), recruitment was low (0.06 +/- 0.02), as was the fawn-to-doe ratio, with similar to 17 fawns per 100 does. These findings suggested population stability, with estimates slightly higher than those from previous assessments, but persistently low recruitment raises concerns about the long-term viability of the Bawean deer. Management strategies should prioritize enhancing fecundity and fawn survival to support the population's future persistence.

AB  - Fossils from Rusinga Island, Kenya, provide an exceptional collection for understanding the evolution and diversification of Early Miocene mammals in Africa, preserving rich assemblages distributed across nearly 2 million years and a variety of habitats. Placing these mammal communities within clear ecological contexts is crucial to understanding the selection pressures that shaped individual taxa but also community composition through time. Although numerous paleoenvironmental reconstructions for these deposits have been suggested, they present conflicting interpretations, with reconstructed habitats for various lithostratigraphic units and/or fossil localities ranging from closed rainforests to open and semiarid environments. Here we present the first paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on carbon and oxygen isotope composition of fossil mammal tooth enamel from Rusinga Island's important fossil assemblages, focusing on specimens from the fossiliferous Hiwegi and Kulu Formations. Our results indicate that these Early Miocene mammals foraged on plants using the C3 photosynthetic pathway in a range of habitats, including those experiencing light and/or water stress, and that habitats were differentially exploited by various species. Although the presence of a dense closed-canopy forest has been documented from at least one Hiwegi stratum, specimens sampled for our analysis exhibit only rare isotopic evidence for foraging within that habitat. Additionally, this study documents a significant difference in the oxygen isotope composition of meteoric water available to fauna found in the Hiwegi Formation versus the younger Kulu Formation. This signals a change in moisture source and/or transport path, or a climatic shift including an increase in mean annual temperature, an increase in aridity, and/or a decrease in mean annual precipitation from the Hiwegi to the Kulu Formation. These results suggest marked differences in paleoenvironmental conditions experienced by these two Early Miocene mammalian communities and underscore the need for more detailed and rigorous analyses of their taxonomic compositions, species abundances, and ecological structures.

The endangered Togean Islands babirusa (Babyrousa togeanensis) is one of these species, with a distribution range limited to four small islands in the Togean Archipelago, Indonesia. Despite being listed as endangered, very little information is available on the distribution and ecology of this species. To address this critical knowledge gap, we here report the first field-based ecological study of the Togean Islands babirusa across its entire distribution range. Following a stratified random sampling procedure, we distributed camera traps at 103 stations across four islands to collect data on the species distribution from July-October 2022. We performed an occupancy modeling analysis to assess the species' habitat use, with various habitat features estimated through remote sensing and field measurements as covariates. We found that forest and mangrove availability over a large area positively influenced babirusa habitat selection. Babirusas only made use of agricultural areas when large forest areas were available nearby. Our results highlight the benefits of redesigning the national park area to accommodate babirusa habitat requirements, specifically by reassigning the non-forested park areas (about 30% of the park area) to non-protected forests currently outside the park boundary (about 50% of total forested area). Our case study exemplifies key challenges associated with conserving large mammals on small islands and highlights the importance of following an adaptive management approach, which in this case implies shifting 30% of the current protected area.

AB  - The population decline of the endangered bitterling species, Acheilognathus typus, following non-native bitterling invasion underscores the need to understand interspecific interactions among bitterling fishes. In this study, the dietary habits of A. typus, alongside introduced non-native bitterling species (Acheilognathus rhombeus and Rhodeus ocellatus ocellatus) and other omnivorous fishes (Oryzias latipes, Pseudorasbora parva, and Rhinogobius sp.), were investigated in a small pond in Japan using gut content and stable isotope analyses (delta 13C and delta 15N). Analysis revealed that microalgae, particularly diatoms with periphytic or benthic life forms, dominated the gut contents of the three bitterling species, which exhibited high dietary overlaps (Pianka's index range 0.89-0.98). Although bitterling species displayed similar delta 13C (mean range -18.4 to -16.1 parts per thousand) and delta 15N (12.1 to 12.6 parts per thousand) values, the other omnivorous fishes exhibited distinct isotopic signatures: lower delta 13C and higher delta 15N values. Isotopic niche overlaps among the three bitterling species were limited (0-2.4%). Furthermore, A. typus and A. rhombeus showed no overlap in the corrected standard ellipse area. These findings suggest that the three bitterling species may forage on similar food items, primarily microalgae, with differing stable isotope ratios, enabling them to partition foraging sites within the confines of a small pond where competition may arise.

AB  - In an effort to restore extirpated elk to their historical range, 52 elk were reintroduced to Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM) in North Carolina, USA, during 2001 and 2002. Since their reintroduction, elk numbers have increased, and elk have extended their range beyond GRSM boundaries. We used spatially explicit capture-recapture (SCR) methods based on fecal DNA to identify individual elk and estimate population abundance (N), apparent survival (phi), per capita recruitment (f), and population growth rate (lambda) in western North Carolina. We walked a series of transects during 3 winter field seasons (2020-2022) and collected elk pellets encountered along those transects. We created spatially explicit capture histories and incorporated those data into both closed and open population SCR models. The top performing closed SCR models for males and females estimated density by year and as a function of the scaled distance to the nearest field, with densities decreasing as the distance increased. Combined male and female N were 179 elk (95% CI = 149-215) in 2020, 220 elk (95% CI = 188-256) in 2021, and 240 elk (95% CI = 207-279) in 2022. The top open population model estimated both phi and lambda as functions of sex and year. The estimate of phi for males was 0.682 (95% CI = 0.317-0.908) during 2020-2021 and 0.339 (95% CI = 0.152-0.596) during 2021-2022 and for females was 0.953 (95% CI = 0.830-1.000) during 2020-2021 and 0.829 (95% CI = 0.601-1.000) during 2021-2022. The annual population growth rate (lambda) for males was 1.127 (95% CI = 0.806-1.575) during 2020-2021 and 0.811 (95% CI = 0.566-1.163) during 2021-2022 and for females was 1.559 (95% CI = 1.162-2.091) during 2020-2021 and 1.122 (95% CI = 0.876-1.437) during 2021-2022. Our elk abundance estimates in areas >300 m from fields were negligible, and we suggest that sampling only the areas in and adjacent to fields in the future will result in reliable but more cost-efficient population estimates. Confidence intervals for vital rate parameters were wide for our 3-year dataset, but continued annual pellet sampling will increase sample sizes for vital rate estimation and thus improve precision. If elk herd expansion on public lands is desired, we suggest habitat modification to establish open grasslands adjacent to forests.

AB  - Calcrete Bontveld is a mosaic vegetation that occurs on flat-topped calcareous ridges adjacent to solid Valley Thicket in the Albany Thicket biome of South Africa. It consists of thicket clumps (bushclumps) scattered in a grassy dwarf shrubland matrix. While the bushclumps of Calcrete Bontveld represent the thicket component in the mosaic the extent and nature of similarity between the bushclumps and adjacent solid Valley Thicket remains unresolved. This study considers the relationship between the thicket communities of these two spatially separate but proximal vegetation types. As expected, bushclumps share a substantive compositional similarity and structure with the nearby solid Valley Thicket but minimally so with the surrounding grassy dwarf shrubland matrix. The latter is made up of elements of other biomes with only a few thicket taxa. The Bushclump composition differs from the adjacent solid Valley Thicket in that it is less succulent and less diverse in the number of plant families. A total of 22 Thicket species were absent from the bushclumps notably a few iconic ones: trees Portulacaria afra, shrubs Cotyledon velutina, Euphorbia mammilaris and Kalanchoe rotundifolia, as well as the geophyte, Gasteria bicolor. By contrast, only 8 taxa were found only in the bushclumps, but not in the local form of solid Valley Thicket (e.g. Ptaeroxylon obliquum and Scolopia zeyheri). Several of these have a Cape Thicket affinity e.g. trees Colpoon compressum and Pterocelastrus tricuspidatus and the shrub Diospyros dichrophylla. The absence of many adjacent thicket species from the bush clumps provides evidence for exchange exclusion of propagules of some Valley Thicket taxa from the bushclumps of Calcrete Bontveld. However, the unique bushclumps are a suitable habitat for establishment of the more distant Cape-affinity taxa.

AB  - The spread of island endemic plants to new islands is an emerging topic, yet the mechanisms driving such invasions remain unclear. While herbivory-related explanations are common for widespread species, their relevance to island endemics is uncertain. Enemy release suggests that introduced plants face less herbivory and invest less in defence, unlike at their native sites with specialized herbivores. Conversely, low defences from minimal native herbivory could make them vulnerable to generalist herbivores in new locations. Additionally, abiotic factors-such as soil type or climate-may influence plant traits and herbivore interactions, potentially overriding or complicating expected herbivory-based invasion outcomes. Here we compared in situ levels of insect leaf herbivory and leaf chemical, physical, and nutritional traits for Rumex lunaria across islands of the Canary Archipelago to which this species is endemic. Specifically, we sampled populations found on islands where this species is native (Tenerife, Gran Canaria, La Gomera, La Palma, and El Hierro) and compared them to invasive (non-native) populations found on Lanzarote. Contrary to predictions, R. lunaria found on Lanzarote (i. e., non-native populations) exhibited higher levels of herbivory but also higher defensive traits-specifically, thicker leaves and higher concentrations of phenolic compounds-compared to populations on islands where this species is native to. To explore underlying correlates to these patterns, we conducted a follow-up structural equation model testing whether abiotic variation between native and non-native populations contributes to explain differences in leaf traits and herbivory. While non-native populations were associated with distinct abiotic conditions relative to native ones-including higher temperatures, reduced and more seasonal precipitation, and denser, more alkaline soils-this did not account for observed differences in leaf traits or herbivory between native vs. non-native populations. Accordingly, these findings suggest that the divergence in leaf defences and herbivory between native and non-native R. lunaria populations is not attributable to the abiotic factors analysed.

AB  - Baits are a means of orally delivering toxicants, medicaments, or chemical markers to wild boar and feral pigs (Sus scrofa). We tested three bait types, the paraffin-feed-sugar-based IREC bait (green and colorant-free versions), a puffed leguminous bait with the same flavoring as the IREC bait (Flavor), and a plain puffed leguminous bait without flavoring (Plain). Baits were deployed in a fenced hunting estate with year-round feeding to assess bait type preference and study the effect of bait flavoring and coloring, pre-feeding, baiting device, and habituation on bait consumption and bait selectivity. Baits were deployed under heavy pavel stones, targeting adult wild boar, or in piglet-selective feeders. The main bait consumer was the wild boar (IREC 54%; Flavor 15%; Plain 16%) followed by azure-winged magpies (Cyanopica cooki; IREC 11%; Flavor 8%; Plain 17%). The most consumed bait was IREC (n = 164; 71%, mean 4.1 baits per site/day), followed by Flavor (102; 40%; 2.5) and Plain (70; 29%; 1.7). Pre-feeding increased bait consumption of all bait types (IREC 92%; Flavor 63%; Plain 40%). IREC baits were more consumed when deployed under stones (86%) than when deployed in piglet feeders (57%), while no difference between baiting devices was observed for Flavor and Plain baits. Birds preferred color-free baits (consumption ratio of 10% for color-free baits and 0% for green baits), while no other animal showed color preference. We suggest using green IREC-type baits, deployed after pre-baiting using species- and age-specific baiting devices.

AB  - The Southern Ocean is warming more rapidly than other parts of our planet. How this region's endemic biodiversity will respond to such changes can be illuminated by studying past events through genetic analyses of time-series data sets, including historic and fossil remains. Archaeological and subfossil remains show that the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) was common along the coasts of Australia and New Zealand in the recent past. This species is now mostly confined to sub-Antarctic islands and the southern tip of South America. We analyzed ancient seal samples from Australia (Tasmania), New Zealand and the Antarctic mainland to examine how southern elephant seals have responded to a changing climate and anthropogenic pressures during the Holocene. Our analyses show that these seals formed part of a broader Australasian lineage, comprising seals from all sampled locations from the south Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. Our study demonstrates that southern elephant seal populations have dynamically altered both range and population sizes under climatic and human pressures over surprisingly short evolutionary timeframes for such a large, long-lived mammal.

AB  - Gorse (Ulex europaeus L.) is a leguminous shrub native to western Europe, voluntarily introduced into Uruguay for ornamental purposes. It is considered among the 100 most problematic invasive species in the world. In Uruguay, it seriously affects both livestock and forestry systems. We evaluated different weed management techniques on a cattle farm invaded by U. europaeus, in the region of Lavalleja. In spring 2020, three treatments were applied-cutting only (C); cutting and grazing (CG); and cutting, applying herbicide, and grazing (CHG)-to 18 plots ranging from 25 m(2) to 50 m(2). Following treatment, U. europaeus regrowth and the height and the perimeter of five plants per plot, as well as seedling recruitment, were assessed over 16 mo. The livestock were cattle (Bos sp.) and sheep (Ovis sp.). The CHG treatment was the most effective in inhibiting the regrowth of U. europaeus, while grazed plants grew less in height compared with those excluded from grazing (CG = 62.3 cm +/- 1.9, C = 84.8 cm +/- 2.0, P < 0.05). However, by the end of the study, seedling recruitment was lower in the C treatment (C = 0.3 +/- 0.3, CG = 3.1 +/- 1.8, CHG = 8.6 +/- 4.6 seedlings m-2, P < 0.05), where increased height of herbaceous vegetation may have reduced the success of the emergence and establishment of regenerants. These results encourage further long-term study of this invasive species' response, as well as an evaluation of the potential impacts of these control measures on non-target species.

AB  - Italy is home to several indigenous goat breeds with great economic and cultural implications, but their genetic makeup remains largely unexplored. This study used the Illumina Goat SNP chip to genotype 142 samples from four Italian goat breeds: Capestrina, Fulva, Grigia Ciociara, and Bianca Monticellana. The genotypes were combined with genome-wide SNP data from 31 Italian breeds to evaluate the genetic profile of Lazio's indigenous goats. After filtering, the dataset included 51,423 SNPs. Genetic structure and diversity were assessed using MDS, ADMIXTURE analysis and inbreeding coefficients. Focusing on the four Lazio breeds, we examined inbreeding levels (FROH), effective population size (Ne), gene exchange, and runs of homozygosity islands (ROHi). The Bianca appeared highly inbred, whereas Fulva, Capestrina, and Grigia showed heterozygosity levels comparable to other breeds. The increased sample sizes highlighted changes in genetic composition, indeed, ADMIXTURE analysis revealed genetic substructures within Bianca and Fulva. The Ne was found to be declining, with Bianca having the lowest Ne, indicating high susceptibility to inbreeding and genetic drift. The NetView analysis identified two interconnected genetic groups corresponding to: Bianca and Fulva. Key contributors to genetic structure, representing ancestral genotypes, were identified, providing targets for conservation. Moreover, ROH analysis pinpointed individuals with excessive ROH and long homozygosity stretches, particularly in Capestrina and Bianca, which could be limited from breeding to preserve genetic diversity. Finally, ROHi revealed genes linked to coat colour, disease resistance, and heat stress tolerance. These conclusions emphasise the importance of local breeds in maintaining biodiversity and enhancing breeding strategies.

AB  - Classical biological control (CBC) can be used to decrease the density of invasive species to below an acceptable ecological and economic threshold. Natural enemies specific to the invasive species are selected from its native range and released into the invaded range. This approach has drawbacks, despite the performance of specificity tests to ensure its safety, because the fundamental host range defined under controlled conditions does not represent the actual host range in natura, and these tests omit indirect interactions within community. We focus on Sonchus oleraceus (Asteraceae), a weed species originating from Western Palearctic that is invasive in many countries and notably in Australia. We explore how analyses of interaction network within its native range can be used to (a) inventory herbivores associated to the target plant, (b) characterize their ecological host ranges and (c) guide the selection of candidate biocontrol agents considering interactions with species from higher trophic levels. Arthropods were collected from plant community sympatric to S. oleraceus, in three bioclimatic regions, and interactions were inferred by a combination of molecular and morphological approaches. The networks reconstructed were structured in several trophic levels from basal species (plant community), to intermediate and top species (herbivorous arthropods and their natural enemies). The sub-network centred on S. oleraceus-related interactions contained 116 taxa and 213 interactions. We identified 47 herbivores feeding on S. oleraceus, 15 of which were specific to the target species. Some discrepancies with respect to published findings or conventional specificity tests suggested possible insufficient sampling effort for the recording of interactions or the existence of cryptic species. Among potential candidate agents, six exhibited interactions with natural enemies. Synthesis and applications. Adopting a network approach as prerequisite step of the classical biological control programme can provide a rapid screening of potential agents to be tested in priority. Once ecological host range defined, we suggest that priority should be given to agent used by a minimum species, and, when they exist, to agents that possess enemies from the most distant taxonomical group from those occurring in the range of introduction.

AB  - African elephants (Loxodonta africana) translocated to the semi-arid Nama-Karoo biome in South Africa present a unique opportunity to study body condition in a resource-scarce environment. We used a longitudinal dataset spanning four years to examine how body condition varies in relation to seasonality, rainfall, and age-sex classes. Contrary to our predictions, rainfall and seasonal changes had limited influence on body condition. Instead, yearround availability of principal forage, including resilient plant species such as Vachellia karroo, likely buffered elephants from seasonal fluctuations in body condition. Adult females exhibited the highest body condition scores, while adult males had the lowest, challenging findings from other populations in more resource-abundant habitats. Juvenile elephants had intermediate scores, contrary to predictions that resource scarcity would predominantly affect younger age groups. These findings suggest that current density and resource availability on this fenced reserve support acceptable body condition levels, comparable to other South African fenced reserves. This study underscores the importance of adaptive management practices in marginal environments and highlights potential implications of life history traits and contraception use for elephant welfare and population dynamics.

AB  - Southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina have a circumpolar distribution and migrate across broad geographic regions. Therefore, they can provide important insights into the responses of top predators to changes in the environment, especially those effected by climate change. For this, determining trophic interactions is key, and thus it is important to investigate the diet of all populations of M. leonina in the Southern Ocean. Limited literature exists on the diet of southern elephant seals at the Prince Edward Islands in the sub-Antarctic. During August and September 1976, the stomach contents of two juvenile male southern elephant seals were opportunistically collected at Marion Island (46(o)54'S, 37(o)51'E), and later analysed. Accumulated cephalopod beaks (n = 137) representing 18 taxa in nine decapod families were found. Onychoteuthidae was numerically the most abundant (28.7%), followed by Brachioteuthidae (21.8%), Neoteuthidae (12.6%), and Histioteuthidae (9.2%). Slosarczykovia circumantarctica (Brachioteuthidae) was the most abundant species (19.5%) followed by Batoteuthis skolops (Batoteuthidae) at 12.6%. Allometric equations using lower rostral lengths showed that the southern elephant seals ingested cephalopods with mantle length between 5.2 and 39.9 cm and weighing between 0.003 and 2.62 kg. There was only one very digested crustacean, and no recognizable fish remains in the stomach contents. The continuation of the investigation relies on examination of natural mortalities and dietary items obtained by stomach lavage of individuals, complemented by, for example, stable isotope compositions captured along the length of vibrissae and within dentinal growth layer groups of teeth as proxies for the elephant seals' trophic ecology.

AB  - The Arabian gazelle (Gazella arabica) and Arabian sand gazelle (G. marica) are globally threatened. In ongoing restoration efforts within Saudi Arabia, 240 captive-bred sand gazelles and 73 Arabian gazelles were reintroduced to the 12,684 km2 Uruq Bani Ma'arid Protected Area in the western Ar Rub' al-Kha<overline>l & imath;<overline> in the mid-late 1990s. Here, we assess the long-term conservation outcome and compare habitat use by both species. Initial post-release distribution was monitored by VHF radio-tracking. Their distribution and relative abundance were studied 20 years later in 2015-2016 using a large-scale camera-trap survey. Our results show Arabian gazelles established across the western side of the protected area, while sand gazelles were widely distributed across the central protected area, with marked seasonal movement into the interior in the cool season and back to the western margin in the hot season. The results confirm both species have retained their known habitat preferences after captive breeding and release. The study also shows that the Arabian gazelle and to a lesser extent sand gazelle undergo seasonal temporal niche switching of activity patterns, exhibiting nocturnal-crepuscular activity during the hot season and largely diurnal-crepuscular activity during the cool season. Releasing groups of desert gazelles at multiple locations simultaneously, over a 2-3 year period into suitable and protected natural habitat is shown to result in established populations. A large-scale long duration camera-trap array provided effective information on relative abundance and distribution of these species persisting 20 years later in a complex habitat where conventional sampling techniques are difficult to implement.

AB  - The likelihood of success of a marine protected area (MPA) is strongly dependent on stakeholders' support. A concern often raised by local fishers is their lack of involvement in the design or management of a MPA and their loss of income owing to lost fishing grounds. We used Algoa Bay, South Africa, as a case study to analyse fisher's and fish-processing factory managers' concerns and perceived economic losses from fishing closures using structured interviews. Since 2009, a 20 km-radius purse-seine fishing-exclusion zone has been tested in Algoa Bay to assess the benefit to population recovery of the endangered African penguin Spheniscus demersus. Costs to the industry were estimated in terms of loss of catches and additional travel time to fishing grounds with and without closures. Fisher responses to interviews revealed general support for conservation and MPAs, but individuals interviewed did not feel that the 20 km fishing exclusion zones in Algoa Bay would aid African penguin conservation. While they systematically raised concerns about potential economic costs to their industry from closures, neither their catch sizes nor travel times varied significantly with fishing exclusion measures. Acknowledgement and assessment of the economic concerns may aid in initiating an informed dialogue amongst the various stakeholders in Algoa Bay, which may increase compliance and success of the newly proclaimed Addo elephant National Park MPA. Continued dialogue may also act as a catalyst for more integrated ocean management of biodiversity and human uses in the bay.

AB  - The seasonal species succession of phytoplankton from Phaeocystis antarctica to diatoms in the Ross Ice Shelf Polynya (RISP) plays a fundamental role in food webs and ecosystem functioning. Previous studies have revealed that this seasonal succession is affected by differences in light, iron demand, aggregation, and subsequent sinking between these two taxa. This study further investigated the dominant process of species succession by analyzing the results of a bulk mixed-layer ecosystem model. The mechanism of processes leading to the replacement by diatoms differs from that for triggering the initial P. antarctica bloom. Light triggered the spring bloom dominated by P. antarctica in iron-rich surface water, which is resupplied by winter convective mixing from the lower layer pool. After reaching its maximum in mid-November, the biomass of P. antarctica declined progressively due to the severe iron limitation. Seasonal species succession can be enhanced by a small amount of predation on P. antarctica by microzooplankton. The long-term iron enrichment promotes the transition by supporting diatom growth. The balance between bottom-up and top-down processes plays a critical role in shaping the phytoplankton composition and promoting the seasonal species succession in the iron-limited upper mixed layer of the RISP.Plain Language Summary Understanding how living things in the high-latitude Southern Ocean are impacted by climate change requires knowledge of how the base of food webs (i.e., marine plants) responds to the environment and predators nowadays. It is especially important to understand the natural behaviors of plants in individual regions that are highly productive and less affected by human activities. The southern Ross Sea is one such region, which remains ice-free all year round and iron-limited during the growing seasons. Typical of this environment is the sequential occurrence of two plant species, but it is not known why they flourish in order. In this study, numerical simulations give us an idea of the different responses of the two plants to irradiance, water temperature, iron concentrations, and predators at different periods of the growing season. The simulations show us that low light conditions favor one species to grow first, iron limited its growth, then the predator's feeding on this species gives another species a chance to grow thereafter. The comparison of feeding process and iron-limiting effects on plants according to the simulations highlights the balance between growth and ingestion in regulating the base of food webs in this unique environment.

AB  - Sustainable regeneration of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) is important for maintaining and improving the future resilience and protective capacity of mountain forests in the southern Swiss Alps. However, increasing densities of wild ungulates, such as red and roe deer, can hamper the regeneration success of silver fir. A comprehensive understanding of forest-wildlife interactions is essential to plan concrete measures for improving the adaptation potential of mountain forests. Here, we monitored the dynamics of natural silver fir regeneration in mountain protective forests. This study encompassed 30 unfenced permanent plots across two sites, Lostallo and Soazza, located in Valle Mesolcina in the southern Swiss Alps. These sites were selected for their comparable ecological characteristics related to silver fir regeneration, yet contrasting densities of mature, seed-bearing silver fir trees. We recorded the number of seedlings (<10 cm height) and saplings (10-200 cm height), and repeatedly assessed height growth, frequency, and intensity of ungulate browsing on saplings in the summers 2016, 2019, and 2022. In 2022, we additionally recorded the presence of browsing on other tree species in the unfenced plots and the height growth increments of silver fir saplings in pre-existing fences. On average, 509 silver fir seedlings/ha were present in the study area, but there was a lower density of saplings (382 saplings/ha). Between 2016 and 2022, the browsing frequency on silver fir saplings increased from 33 per cent to nearly 100 per cent, accompanied by a significant rise in browsing intensity. Furthermore, sapling height growth from 2019 to 2022 was significantly reduced or even negative in the unfenced plots as compared to the growth of saplings in the fenced plots. The observed seedling density indicated a good potential for natural regeneration of silver fir, irrespective of the differences in the density of seed-bearing trees between the two sites. However, the increased ungulate browsing impaired successful regeneration in the considered mountain forests in the southern Swiss Alps. Thus, without an effective control of ungulate browsing, silver fir may not be able to substantially contribute to the transition to more resilient and future-proof mountain forests.

AB  - Two introduced invasive red macroalgae, Eucheuzna denticulatum (Burman) Collins & Hervey and Gracilaria salicornia C. Ag., progressively declined in abundance in Kane'ohe Bay, Hawai'i, following similar to 30 years of increase since their introduction in the mid-1970s. The declines were not the result of biological control or mechanical control efforts, but instead were the result of grazing by native herbivores, probably fishes, as demonstrated by field experiments conducted in 2014 with algal thalli exposed to, and protected from grazing. Two long-term time-series of the abundance of herbivorous fishes at Kane'ohe Bay patch and fringing reef sites indicated that the abundance of herbivorous fishes increased from 2007 through 2014 over the period when these macroalgae declined in cover. Analyses of data of algal cover from surveys of Kane'ohe Bay reefs carried out between 1996 and 2018 indicate that the declines in E. denticulatum and G. salicornia began in approximately 2008, several years before control programs commenced on some of the reefs in the bay. In addition to intense herbivory, high summer water temperatures in 2014 and 2015 may have contributed to the decline in E. denticulatum. Naturally occurring declines in the abundance of alien invasive marine algal species have rarely been reported in the literature. These reductions in macroalgal abundance are the second instance of decline in invasive macroalgae in Kane'ohe Bay since 2006, and have reduced competition between macroalgae and corals on reef flats and reef slopes across the bay.

AB  - Current lowland agricultural landscapes are characterized by a low representation of biodiversity-rich seminatural habitats. Even in structurally simple farmlands, the presence of in-field, non-farmed habitats may be beneficial for species persistence. Here, for the first time, we evaluated the importance of non-farmed habitats under high-voltage power line infrastructure for medium-sized mammals inhabiting the intensively-used agricultural landscape. We found the clear choice (in terms of visit frequency and use-intensity) of power pylons over adjacent farmland by individual mammalian species during the winter, with a clear preference for power pylons for dominant species (European hare, roe deer, and red fox). Similarly, our results also revealed that individual mammalian species spend more time and showed a higher share of comfort behavior (e.g., feeding, resting for herbivores, and sniffing for carnivores) under power pylons, while the species mainly passed through the adjacent farmland. Finally, analyses focusing on the effect of local and landscape characteristics on mammal useintensity underneath power pylons have revealed significant results only for European hare. European hare's useintensity increased with higher shrub density under power pylons, higher distance to the field edge, and shorter distance to shrub patches. Our findings demonstrated that power line infrastructure might represent crucial infield non-farmed habitats, offering suitable resting and foraging habitats for various mammal species in agricultural landscape. These habitats may significantly contribute to increasing the biological potential of structurally simple farmlands, which should be taken into consideration in conservation planning within agroecosystems.

AB  - Straight-tusked elephants (genus: Palaeoloxodon) including their island dwarf forms are extinct enigmatic members of the Pleistocene megafauna and the most common Pleistocene elephants after the mammoths. Their taxonomic placement has been revised several times. Using palaeogenomic evidence, previous studies suggested that the European P. antiquus has a hybrid origin, but no molecular data have been retrieved from their Asian counterparts, leaving a gap in our knowledge of the global phylogeography and population dynamics of Palaeoloxodon. Here, we captured a high-quality complete mitogenome from a Pleistocene Elephantidae molar (CADG841) from Northern China, which was previously morphologically assigned to the genus Elephas (Asian elephant), and partial mitochondrial sequences (838 bp) of another Palaeoloxodon sp. specimen (CADG1074) from Northeastern China. We found that both Chinese specimens cluster with a 244 000-year-old P. antiquus (specimen name: WE) from Western Europe, suggesting that this clade may represent a population with a large spatial span across Eurasia. Based on the fossil record and the molecular dating of both the divergences of different Palaeoloxodon mitochondrial clades and previously determined hybridization events, we propose that this Eurasian-wide WE clade provides evidence for an earlier migration and/or another hybridization event that happened in the evolutionary history of straight-tusked elephants.

AB  - Artificial feeding of wildlife is a widespread, but controversial, management practice with many positive and negative effects. Besides the effects on the target species, it can also affect other (non-target) species by modulating interspecific interactions. Previous research showed that the presence of artificial feeding sites for bears and ungulates increases the risk of kleptoparasitism by the brown bear (Ursus arctos) on kills made by Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). However, it remains unknown whether lynx adjust their behaviour to the distribution of artificial feeding sites, which also attract potential prey (ungulates) for lynx. Using GPS telemetry data, we explored the spatiotemporal lynx response to such sites and studied how this response varied with experience level, i.e. between adult resident individuals ('experienced lynx') and juveniles and/or trans-located individuals ('naYve lynx'). We found that lynx experience played an important role in the use of artificial feeding sites. Specifically, while both experienced and naYve lynx selected feeding sites while moving within their home range, the attraction was stronger among the naYve lynx. Considering the distribution of kill sites, naYve lynx killed prey closer to the artificial feeding sites than expected, while experienced lynx avoided them. Finally, the proximity to artificial feeding sites by experienced lynx showed an annual variation, matching the seasonal kleptoparasitism risk, with overall closer proximity to feeding sites during the winter, when bears are less active, which is also when ungulates are more concentrated around feeding sites. Our study suggests that, despite the relatively recent introduction of artificial feeding in the ecosystems, wildlife can learn to respond to the altered interactions with other species. However, this appears to be a learning process with manifold management and conservation implications. A better under-standing of species interactions and space use in the context of resource manipulation is increasingly relevant as the use of anthropogenic food by wildlife is nowadays substantial and widespread across most parts of the world.

AB  - Florida Key deer mortality data (1966-2017) showed that about 75% of all reported deer mortalities were related to collisions with vehicles. In 2001-2002, the eastern section of US Hwy 1 on Big Pine Key (Florida, USA) was mitigated with a wildlife fence, 2 underpasses, and 4 deer guards. After mitigation, the number of reported Key deer road mortalities reduced substantially in the mitigated section, but this was negated by an increase in collisions along the unmitigated section of US Hwy 1 on Big Pine Key, both in absolute numbers and expressed as a percentage of the total deer population size. The data also showed that the increase in Key deer collisions along the unmitigated highway section on the island could not be explained through an increase in Key deer population size, or by a potential increase in traffic volume. The overall Key deer road mortality along US Hwy 1 was not reduced but was moved from the mitigated section to the nearby unmitigated section. Thus, there was no net benefit of the fence in reducing collisions. After mitigation, a significant hotspot of Key deer-vehicle collisions appeared at the western fence-end, and additional hotspots occurred further west along the unmitigated highway. Exploratory spatial analyses led us to reject the unmitigated highway section on Big Pine Key as a suitable control for a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) analysis into the effectiveness of the mitigation measures in reducing deer-vehicle collisions. Instead, we selected highway sections west and east of Big Pine Key as a control. The BACI analysis showed that the wildlife fence and associated mitigation measures were highly effective (95%) in reducing deer-vehicle collisions along the mitigated highway section. Nonetheless, in order to reduce the overall number of deer-vehicle collisions along US Hwy 1, the entire highway section on Big Pine Key would need to be mitigated. However, further mitigation is complicated because of the many buildings and access roads for businesses and residences. This case study illustrates that while fences and associated measures can be very effective in reducing collisions, wildlife fences that are too short may result in an increase in collisions in nearby unmitigated road sections, especially near fence-ends. Therefore it is important to carefully consider the appropriate spatial scale over which highway mitigation measures are implemented and evaluated.

AB  - Spreading of Mycobacterium bovis causing animal tuberculosis (TB) at livestock-wildlife-environment interfaces remains a significant problem. Recently, we provided evidence of widespread environmental contamination of an endemic animal TB setting with viable and dormant M. bovis cells able to recover metabolic activity, making indirect transmission via environmental contamination plausible. We now report the first whole genome sequences of M. bovis recovered from the environment. We establish epidemiological links at the environmentanimal interface by phylogenomic comparison of these M. bovis genomes with those isolated from livestock and wild ungulates from the same area. Environmental and animal genomes are highly intertwined and distribute similarly into the same M. bovis lineages, supporting several instances of environmental contamination. This study provides compelling evidence of M. bovis excretion into the environment and viability maintenance, supporting the environment as a potential source of new infection. These insights have clear implications for policy formulation, advocating environmental surveillance and an ecosystem perspective in TB control programs. Environmental Implication: We report the first whole genome sequences of M. bovis from the environment and establish epidemiological links at the environment-animal interface, demonstrating close phylogenomic relatedness of animal and environmental M. bovis. Definitive evidence of M. bovis excretion into the environment with viability maintenance is provided, supporting the environment as a potential source of new infection. Implications of this work include methodological innovations offering a tool to resolve indirect transmission chains and support customized biosecurity measures. Policy formulation aiming at the control of animal tuberculosis and cost mitigation should consider these findings, encouraging environmental surveillance in official eradication programmes.

AB  - Cattle fever ticks (CFT) represent a significant economic burden to the livestock industry worldwide, and novel methods are needed for treatment of CFT on livestock and wildlife. Two similar botanical pesticides, Stop the Bites (R)! and Arkion (R) Fly and Tick Spray, were evaluated in a pen trial to control CFT on cattle using a motion activated 3-D Quik Hand (TM) livestock sprayer. The cattle were repeatedly treated passively as they crossed through the sprayer to travel between compartments of the pen to access food and water/shade. Both formulations of the botanical pesticides caused significant mortality to CFT when compared to the untreated water control. The 3-D Quik Hand (TM) sprayer is a novel tool for the low-volume and high-frequency application of pesticides to control CFT. This tool could provide a new option in addition to treatment using dipping vats, spray boxes, or truck mounted sprayers for use by the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program and livestock producers. It may also be useful to treat nilgai antelope and white-tailed deer infested with CFT as they move through gaps in livestock fencing or natural or man-made funnels that lead to water or other lures. Further research is warranted to optimize the rates of the botanical pesticides and methods to deploy the 3-D Quik Hand (TM) sprayer in the field.

AB  - Giant clams (Tridacna and Hippopus) are large marine bivalves occupying tropical and subtropical reefs in the Indo-Pacific. Giant clam populations have declined in many areas of the Indo-Pacific and continue to be threatened by harvesting and environmental change. The small giant clam (Tridacna maxima) occurs throughout the Indo-Pacific and has been subject to several phylogeographic studies across its range. However, given its broad range, there are several areas where the genetic diversity and connectivity of T. maxima populations has not been characterised. Here, we analyse the mitochondrial marker cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) to examine the genetic diversity and connectivity of T. maxima in two regions: Australia's Coral Sea Marine Park and the Cook Islands. Samples were collected from 13 reefs within the Coral Sea Marine Park and ten islands within the Cook Islands archipelago. Tridacna maxima across the sampled region of the Coral Sea did not display any population structure, whereas significant population structure was detected for T. maxima within the Cook Islands. For the Cook Islands, most pairwise comparisons involving an island in the northern group (Manihiki) were significant, as were comparisons for Palmerston (a more centrally located island) and the southern islands, Rarotonga and Mangaia. Both regions displayed high haplotype diversities (> 0.90), indicating that they are important repositories of genetic diversity. Additional CO1 data from throughout T. maxima's distribution showed that the Coral Sea clams belonged to the clade occurring in the South-Western Pacific Ocean, whilst those from the Cook Islands belonged to a unique clade found in the Central Pacific Ocean. This clade extended from Fiji in the west to French Polynesia in the east and the atolls of Palmyra and Tarawa (Kiribati) in the north. Our assessment of genetic diversity and population structure in these regions will assist with management decisions for the species.

AB  - Submerged aquatic plants with mixed reproduction mode may show enhanced clonal growth explained by environmental conditions. For Stuckenia pectinata (L.) Bo<spacing diaeresis>rner this has been linked to within-lake factors, both biotic (tuber predation, herbivory, periphyton shading) and abiotic (hydrological connectivity, sediment type). We investigated the S. pectinata population from Lake Naivasha, where submerged aquatic plants tolerated strong historical water level fluctuations until introduced crayfish, shading by floating exotic weeds and increased turbidity nearly eradicated them, although some stands now rebounded in various lake areas. Using 13 nuclear microsatellite loci, we analyzed genetic diversity and structure of S. pectinata subpopulations along the southeastern shoreline of the main lake and inside Crescent Island Crater, a peripheral lake basin enclosed within the rim of an extinct volcano. Results revealed a predominantly sexual reproductive strategy with limited clonal expansion in the main lake contrasting with pronounced clonal growth in the crater basin. Each subpopulation experienced recent bottlenecks. Crater basin subpopulations exhibited the strongest divergence, lower clonal diversity and larger-sized clones. We explain this differentiation by the exposed crater rim acting as barrier, isolating the crater basin from the main lake during recent decades when low water levels prevailed, accompanied with less negative impact from alien species than in the main lake. Clonal extension occurred on steepsloping hard sandy substrates, that likely prompted local reproductive adaptations. Genetic diversity, clonal structure and connectivity patterns are discussed in the light of the specific history and features of Lake Naivasha.

AB  - Unsustainable grazing practices result in degradation of arid and semiarid rangelands in southern Africa. Continuous grazing systems are often blamed for degradation, while rotational grazing systems are seen as more sustainable. The discussion about the impact of these grazing practices also has political and societal dimensions: continuous grazing is often related to communal farming while independent farmers are often economically able to subdivide large camps to rotate livestock and rest the rangeland. We evaluated 17 studies from southern Africa that compared the impact of continuous vs. rotational grazing on vegetation and found the outcomes to be contradictory and inconclusive. We identified several issues regarding the comparability of these grazing systems (such as differences in stocking densities, in herbivore composition and in spatial scale of data collection), making comparisons of the impacts of the two grazing systems ambiguous. Based on the evaluation of these studies, we list factors affecting the outcome of comparative rangeland studies that need to be considered when comparing rangeland management types. We conclude that only if comparative studies are designed to ensure result comparability, then the two management systems can be properly compared, thereby forming a basis for further research on sustainable grazing systems.

AB  - Phylogeography of terrestrial mammals on islands is complicated because of the geological changes in the island configuration or their past population dynamics on the nearby landmass. To understand the function of Shodoshima Island in the Seto Inland Sea in preserving lineages of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) and sika deer (Cervus nippon), we investigated the molecular phylogeny of these species on the island. We analyzed a partial sequence of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region of the two species. We identified four mtDNA haplotypes in macaques, including western and eastern Japan lineages. Two mtDNA haplotypes for deer were discovered, which were categorized into only the northern Japan lineage. Their nucleotide sequences were identical except for a tandem repeat. These results suggest that the phylogeographic trend was remarkably different between the two species, which may be due to the migration of multiple lineages of macaques to the island when it was connected to Honshu Island, and a bottleneck effect on the deer population caused by overhunting. Some haplotypes were probably unique to the Shodoshima population of both species. The presence of region-specific haplotypes suggests the importance of Shodoshima Island to maintain genetic diversity of the species.

AB  - The anthropogenic movement of species has favoured the introduction of invasive plants worldwide. Invasive plants are frequently released from their natural enemies; however, new associations with generalist herbivores may induce defence mechanisms of non-native plants. Defensive traits are often directly related to the highly competitive ability, but also to potential antagonisms and mutualisms that they can establish with soil microorganisms. Here, we examined whether the intraspecific competition and soil microorganisms influence the morphological and physiological traits of Carpobrotus edulis when is being attacked by the native generalist snail Theba pisana. To achieve this, we grew two C. edulis individuals in separate and same pots filled with live or sterile sand, and with or without T. pisana. Our results indicated that herbivory induced an increase of shoot biomass in attacked C. edulis individuals (i.e., treated donor plants), as well as in un-attacked neighbouring individuals co-growing in the same pot (i.e., untreated recipient plants). Nevertheless, intraspecific competition nor soil microorganisms did not affect the growth of C. edulis despite reduced physiological activity and damage caused by the herbivore. Overall, our findings revealed that C. edulis individuals tolerate snail attack by inducing a compensatory growth response. We conclude that phenotypic plasticity of invasive C. edulis favours tolerance against herbivores, but we also suggest that plant-plant interactions probably determine the plant growth of un-attacked neighbouring C. edulis individuals, thus favouring their invasion mechanisms.
