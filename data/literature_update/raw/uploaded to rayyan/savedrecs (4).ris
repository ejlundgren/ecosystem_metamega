AB  - Introduction: One Health is a multifaceted approach increasingly used to explore climate-driven public health challenges; however, it is often lacking the expertise of local people who are most connected to and affected by these challenges. Our goal was to explore how nomadic herders in a conservation area (Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in Mongolia) understand the issues of interconnectedness of environmental, animal, and human health through Foot-and-Mouth Disease of ungulates and climate change. Materials and Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study of 104 nomadic herders in Dornogobi, Mongolia, using a questionnaire with 11 open-ended questions which were translated into English for analyses and coding using NVivo. The questions explored herders' perceptions and experiences on the linkages between human wellbeing, environmental factors, and outbreaks of Foot-and-Mouth Disease of ungulated animals, which is occurring more frequently in Mongolia. Results: Pasture degradation was the factor herders most linked to animal, human, and environmental health and climate change. The herders displayed adept understanding of One Health concepts. The herders' responses throughout the survey revealed a cycle where climate change contributes to landscape degradation, declining animal health, and human socioeconomic consequences. Discussion: Mongolia's rich tradition of herding and generational linkages to natural resources provide a unique, holistic approach to understanding the effects of climate change and landscape degradation on disease transmission and human well-being. Conclusion: Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities should be actively engaged through leadership and input in formulating transdisciplinary strategies to combat climate change and its effects on animal and human health.

AB  - . Research on human-elephant interactions (HEI) seeks to better understand relationships between people and elephants with the goal of reducing unwanted interactions for the long-term survival of elephants in social-ecological systems. Many examinations of HEI often rely on a short temporal scale of several seasons to several years, often because of limited data availability across time. These examinations offer limited understanding of processes that influence HEI and mutual adaptations of people and elephants. In this synthesis, I present an ethnographic case study from the Okavango Delta, Botswana, where human and elephant populations have increased in the past 20 years. I use bricolage, a practice of using available materials at hand, to weave together diverse historical and current scholarship and primary data to understand dynamics of HEI and coadaptation across three different periods (pre-colonial, colonial, and post-independence). I show that people and elephants were coadapted in the pre-colonial period when people were highly mobile and hunted elephants with rudimentary technologies in ways that supported human development across southern Africa with minimal impact on elephants. European colonization brought sweeping changes, including through the introduction of guns and the development of the ivory trade that led to massive declines in elephant populations. Development policies that were magnified in the years following independence, including the establishment of land policies that settled communities, additionally disrupted the formally fluid nature of HEI. Simultaneously, wildlife conservation policies that coincided with dramatic increases in elephant populations shape how people perceive HEI and elephants as a predominant environmental force today. I argue that the incorporation of wider historical contexts, where necessary through the practice of bricolage, reveals coadaptation across time and offers understanding of possibilities of coexistence where people and elephants thrive alongside each other.

AB  - The increasing discharge and ubiquitous occurrence of novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) in aquatic environments have initiated intense global concerns; however, little information is available regarding their structure-related trophodynamics in marine food webs. In this study, a tropical marine food web including 29 species (18 fish and 11 invertebrate species) was collected from coral reef waters of the Xisha Islands, the South China Sea, for an analysis of 11 representative NBFRs. The mean Sigma NBFR concentrations generally increased in the following sequence: sea cucumbers (0.330 ng/g lw) < crabs (0.380 ng/g lw) < shells (2.10 ng/g lw) < herbivorous fishes (2.30 ng/g lw) < carnivorous fishes (4.13 ng/g lw), with decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) and hexabromobenzene (HBB) as the predominant components. Trophic magnification was observed for all of the investigated NBFRs, with trophic magnification factors (TMFs) ranging from 1.53 (tetrabromobisphenol A bis(dibromopropyl ether)) to 5.32 (HBB). Significant negative correlations were also found between the TMFs and the tested in vitro transformation clearance rates (CLin vitro) for the target NBFRs except for bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,4,5,6-tetrabromo-phthalate (TBPH) (p < 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed that the transformation rate is a more powerful predictor for TMFs than the hydrophobicity of NBFRs in this marine food web.

AB  - BackgroundPigs are excellent large animal models with several similarities to humans. They provide valuable insights into biomedical research that are otherwise difficult to obtain from rodent models. However, even if miniature pig strains are used, their large stature compared with other experimental animals requires a specific maintenance facility which greatly limits their usage as animal models. Deficiency of growth hormone receptor (GHR) function causes small stature phenotypes. The establishment of miniature pig strains via GHR modification will enhance their usage as animal models. Microminipig is an incredibly small miniature pig strain developed in Japan. In this study, we generated a GHR mutant pig using electroporation-mediated introduction of the CRISPR/Cas9 system into porcine zygotes derived from domestic porcine oocytes and microminipig spermatozoa.Methods and resultsFirst, we optimized the efficiency of five guide RNAs (gRNAs) designed to target GHR in zygotes. Embryos that had been electroporated with the optimized gRNAs and Cas9 were then transferred into recipient gilts. After embryo transfer, 10 piglets were delivered, and one carried a biallelic mutation in the GHR target region. The GHR biallelic mutant showed a remarkable growth-retardation phenotype. Furthermore, we obtained F1 pigs derived from the mating of GHR biallelic mutant with wild-type microminipig, and GHR biallelic mutant F2 pigs through sib-mating of F1 pigs.ConclusionsWe have successfully demonstrated the generation of biallelic GHR-mutant small-stature pigs. Backcrossing of GHR-deficient pig with microminipig will establish the smallest pig strain which can contribute significantly to the field of biomedical research.

AB  - Background Identification of biomarkers, which are measurable characteristics of biological datasets, can be challenging. Although amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) can be considered potential biomarkers, identifying important ASVs in high-throughput sequencing datasets is challenging. Noise, algorithmic failures to account for specific distributional properties, and feature interactions can complicate the discovery of ASV biomarkers. In addition, these issues can impact the replicability of various models and elevate false-discovery rates. Contemporary machine learning approaches can be leveraged to address these issues. Ensembles of decision trees are particularly effective at classifying the types of data commonly generated in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) studies due to their robustness when the number of features in the training data is orders of magnitude larger than the number of samples. In addition, when combined with appropriate model introspection algorithms, machine learning algorithms can also be used to discover and select potential biomarkers. However, the construction of these models could introduce various biases which potentially obfuscate feature discovery. Results We developed a decision tree ensemble, LANDMark, which uses oblique and non-linear cuts at each node. In synthetic and toy tests LANDMark consistently ranked as the best classifier and often outperformed the Random Forest classifier. When trained on the full metabarcoding dataset obtained from Canada's Wood Buffalo National Park, LANDMark was able to create highly predictive models and achieved an overall balanced accuracy score of 0.96 +/- 0.06. The use of recursive feature elimination did not impact LANDMark's generalization performance and, when trained on data from the BE amplicon, it was able to outperform the Linear Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression models, and Stochastic Gradient Descent models (p <= 0.05). Finally, LANDMark distinguishes itself due to its ability to learn smoother non-linear decision boundaries. Conclusions Our work introduces LANDMark, a meta-classifier which blends the characteristics of several machine learning models into a decision tree and ensemble learning framework. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply this type of ensemble approach to amplicon sequencing data and we have shown that analyzing these datasets using LANDMark can produce highly predictive and consistent models.

AB  - Introduction The most striking feature of depression is sadness and a loss of interest in activities, which represents a major cause of disability globally. Therefore, it is necessary to identify novel antidepressants for clinical practice. Ginsenoside Rh2 (Rh2) is one of the major bioactive ginsenosides that can be extracted from Panax ginseng and has been demonstrated to improve both memory and learning. The purpose of this study was to provide broad insight into the mechanisms underlying depression and gain greater insights into antidepressant therapy. Methods In this study, we first established an effective and feasible depression animal model of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and behavioral testing was evaluated by the forced swim test (FST), the tail suspension test (TST) and the sucrose preference test. Following pretreatment with Rh2 (10 and 20 mg/kg), the immobility time of mice was reduced without affecting locomotor activity in both the FST and TST. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to investigate the activation of the hippocampal BDNF signaling pathway and hippocampal neurogenesis. Results Different concentrations of Rh2 significantly reduced depressive-like symptoms in CUMS-induced mice and downregulated the effects of the BDNF signaling cascade and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the administration of K252a completely prevented the antidepressant-like activity of Rh2 in mice. Conclusion The results indicated that Rh2 possesses the antidepression action via the positive regulation of the BDNF-TrkB pathway.

AB  - The ecological relationship among plants, rhizobacteria and plant consumers has attracted the attention of researchers due to its implications in field crops. It is known that, the rhizosphere is occupied not only by rhizobacteria which grant benefits to the plants but also by bacteria which are detrimental for them. In this work, we construct and analyze a plants-rhizobacteria-plant consumers system. In the modeling process, it is assumed that there is a conditioned interaction between plants and bacteria in the rhizosfera such that there is a mutualistic relationship at low densities of rhizobacteria and the relationship is parasitic or competitive at higher densities of them. Benefits granted by rhizobacteria include mechanisms that increase the plant growth and defense mechanisms against plant consumers. From the analysis of the model and its simplified version, we show that scenarios of coexistence of all populations can occur for a wide range of values of the parameters which describe biotic or abiotic factors; however, these scenarios are in risk since scenarios of exclusion of species can occur simultaneously due to the presence of bistability phenomena. The results obtained can be useful for the decision makers to design interventions strategies on field crops when plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria are used.

As a result, eight undescribed compounds, including four zwitterionic alkylpyridinium salts, hippospondines A -D (1-4), and four 3-alkylpyridine alkaloids, hippospondines E (5), F (6), and (+/-)-hippospondine G (7), were isolated from the marine sponge H. lachne, together with one known 3-alkylpyridine alkaloid (8). The undescribed structures were elucidated by HRESIMS, NMR, DP4+ and CP3 probability analysis, and the Snatzke's method. Hippospondines A -D (1-4) represent the rare example of inner salt type alkylpyridinium alkaloid with a farnesyl moiety. Compounds 1-3 and 8 were subjected to cytotoxic and lymphocyte proliferation assays. Compound 3 exhibited a weak promotion effect on the ConA-induced T lymphocyte proliferation.

AB  - Hydrosocial territories scholarship has contributed to advancing relational, power-sensitive, multiscalar understandings of water and its governance. Grounded in critical water studies, political ecology, and political geography, this scholarship draws attention to how water distributions are contested between different interest groups and their respective notions of how water is and should be governed at multiple interrelated spatial and temporal scales. We provide an overview of the literature on hydrosocial territories with the objective of tracing the development and application of this framework since its introduction in the mid-2010s. The article summarizes how hydrosocial territories research has developed conceptually, methodologically, and thematically. We find that hydrosocial territories research employs largely qualitative methodologies to study water-related disputes surrounding a diversity of themes including hydraulic infrastructures, agricultural production and export, urbanization, river basin management, extractive industries, and conservation. We conclude with a reflection on potential ways forward for hydrosocial territories scholarship.

AB  - Extant Malagasy members of the genus Macronycteris are broadly distributed across the island and vary in size with respect to sex, bioclimatic zone, and intraspecific clade affinity. An extinct Quaternary species, M. besaoka, was considered morphologically distinct from modern Macronycteris based on its robust mandibles and wider molars. Since its description, taxonomic and phylogenetic revisions have reshaped our understanding of Malagasy Macronycteris. This included the discovery of the cryptic species M. cryptovalorona and the recognition of two clades within M. commersoni. Recent augmentation of museum cranial collections of Malagasy members of the genus has permitted renewed investigation into morphological trends. Herein, we examine craniodental morphology of modern Malagasy Macronycteris spp., and investigate the validity of M. besaoka through nonparametric multivariate methods. The results of this study support M. besaoka as a valid species. Further, some specimens previously diagnosed as M. besaoka are best associated with modern M. commersoni from the dry bioclimatic zone. These results have implications for the history of the bat community at Anjohibe Cave, as well as the identification of other Macronycteris subfossils from dry western Madagascar.

AB  - Introduction. Liver fibrosis is caused by continuous wound healing responses to various harmful stimuli, including viral infection, drugs, alcohol, and autoimmune liver disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of extracts of Periplaneta americana (EPA) in rats with pig serum-induced liver fibrosis to preliminarily assess the antifibrotic effect of EPA.
   Material and methods. Seventy rats were randomly divided into 7 groups (10 rats in each group): HC, the healthy control group; FC, the fibrotic control group; TL, low-dose EPA treatment group group; TM, medium-dose EPA group; TH, high-dose EPA treatment group; TC1, Panax notoginseng/Salvia mitiorrhiza treatment control group 1; TC2, colchicine treatment control group 2. TC1 and TC2 were used as the positive control to demonstrate the difference between EPA and the effects of other compounds. The liver fibrosis model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mL pig serum twice a week for 13 weeks in all groups except for the HC group. The hepatic fibrosis model was established at the 7th week, and followingly, the corresponding compounds were administered once a day in all groups for 6 weeks. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity was determined in rat blood serum. We also measured liver fibrosis-related serum markers, including hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN), type III pre-collagen (PC-III) and type IV collagen (IV-C). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson stainings were used to assess liver morphology and determine the stage of fibrosis. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the protein expression of NF-kappa B, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in rat liver tissue.
   Results. Compared with that of the HC group, the liver tissue of the FC group presented obvious liver damage and collagen deposition. The serum levels of ALT, AST, HA, LN, PC-III and IV-C and the expression of NF-kappa B, alpha-SMA, TGF-beta 1 and TIMP-1 in the FC group were significantly higher than those in the HC group, the EPA treatment groups, the TC1 group and the TC2 group (P < 0.01). The levels of serum ALT, AST, HA, LN, PC-III and IV-C and the expression of alpha-SMA, NF-kappa B, TGF-beta 1 and TIMP-1 in the TL, TC1 and TC2 groups were significantly higher than those TM and TH groups (P < 0.05). EPA treatment significantly improved liver function, decreased collagen deposition and reversed the pathological changes related to liver fibrosis.
   Conclusions. We found that EPA could reduce liver inflammation, suppress liver cell degeneration and necrosis, and reduce the formation of liver fibrous tissue. Its mechanism might be associated with inhibiting the expression of TGF-beta 1, TIMP-1, NF-kappa B and alpha-SMA to block signal transduction pathways in the hepatic fibrosis process. Therefore, EPA, as a traditional Chinese medicine, might be potentially used to prevent and treat hepatic fibrosis in the future. However, further more experiments are necessary to verify its effectiveness and possible signaling pathways.

AB  - IntroductionMaternal sleep deprivation (MSD), which induces inflammation and synaptic dysfunction in the hippocampus, has been associated with learning and memory impairment in offspring. Melatonin (Mel) has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective function. However, the beneficial effect of Mel on MSD-induced cognitive impairment and its mechanisms are unknown.MethodsIn the present study, adult offspring suffered from MSD were injected with Mel (20 mg/kg) once a day during postnatal days 61-88. The cognitive function was evaluated by the Morris water maze test. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA and protein levels of synaptic plasticity associated proteins were examined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting.ResultsThe results showed that MSD impaired learning and memory in the offspring mice. MSD increased the levels of interleukin (IL)-1creIL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and decreased the expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, tyrosine kinase receptor B, postsynaptic density protein-95, and synaptophysin in the hippocampus. Furthermore, Mel attenuated cognitive impairment and restored markers of inflammation and synaptic plasticity to control levels.ConclusionsThese findings indicated that Mel could ameliorate learning and memory impairment induced by MSD, and these beneficial effects were related to improvement in inflammation and synaptic dysfunction.

AB  - Biochar exhibits substantial potential for interaction with clay minerals upon its introduction into the environment. However, the precise impact of this interaction on the surface properties of biochar and its capacity for metal sorption, particularly in relation to varying biochar particle sizes, remains unclear. Therefore, this study focused on biochar particles derived from pig bone, varying in size, and subjected them to treatment with two common clay minerals (kaolinite and montmorillonite). The objective was to scrutinize their influence on the physicochemical properties of biochar and its binding affinity for Cadmium (Cd). The results revealed that postinteraction with kaolinite and montmorillonite, the Cd sorption capacity of large biochar particles (250-425 mu m) saw respective increments of 11.6% and 26.6%, whereas the Cd removal capacity of small biochar particles (25-75 mu m) experienced reductions of 8.8% and 18.5%, respectively. Additionally, the surface area of the large biochar particles increased by 19.5% and 32.9%, while that of the small biochar particles decreased by 31.3% and 17.7% after interactions with kaolinite and montmorillonite, respectively. Through the analysis of 2D-FTIRCOS, it was determined that regardless of particle size, COO- on the initial pig bone biochar exhibited the highest sensitivity for Cd adsorption. However, after interaction with kaolinite and montmorillonite, Al-O and Si-O-Al groups were identified as the most responsive for the small biochar particles, while -OH and O-P-O groups exhibited heightened sensitivity for the large biochar particles in adsorbing Cd. The results of this study offer valuable insights into how typical clay minerals can impact the surface properties and metal sorption capacity of biochar of varying particle sizes, which is advantageous for optimizing the production and environmental applications of biochar.

AB  - The rising incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), particularly among underrepresented populations, highlights the urgent need for tools that can uncover clinically meaningful, population-specific genomic alterations. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway plays a key role in tumor progression, survival, and therapeutic resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC), yet its impact in EOCRC remains insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we developed AI-HOPE-PI3K, a conversational artificial intelligence platform that integrates harmonized clinical and genomic data for real-time, natural language-based analysis of PI3K pathway alterations. Built on a fine-tuned biomedical LLaMA 3 model, the system automates cohort generation, survival modeling, and mutation frequency comparisons using multi-institutional cBioPortal datasets annotated with clinical variables. AI-HOPE-PI3K replicated known associations and revealed new findings, including worse survival in colon versus rectal tumors harboring PI3K alterations, enrichment of INPP4B mutations in Hispanic/Latino EOCRC patients, and favorable survival outcomes associated with high tumor mutational burden in FOLFIRI-treated patients. The platform also enabled context-specific survival analyses stratified by age, tumor stage, and molecular alterations. These findings support the utility of AI-HOPE-PI3K as a scalable and accessible tool for integrative, pathway-specific analysis, demonstrating its potential to advance precision oncology and reduce disparities in EOCRC through data-driven discovery.

AB  - Monitoring the weight of fattening pigs represents a fundamental requirement for efficient livestock management. While traditional weight measurement approaches have demonstrated operational limitations in largescale farming environments, computer vision-based estimation methods have faced accuracy challenges due to the variability in pig postures. This study introduces the Cascade Vision Detection Algorithm for Monitoring Fattening Pig Weight (CVDA-MFPW), which integrates four complementary methodological components into a comprehensive end-to-end weight monitoring pipeline: Cascaded Visual Detection for systematic image processing, Posture-Based Quality Screening for automated pose assessment, Point Cloud-Based Morphometric Feature Extraction for precise measurement acquisition, and Morphological Feature-Based Weight Estimation for accurate prediction. The research methodology leveraged a dataset comprising 117 fattening pigs, yielding 17,406 samples for instance segmentation and 6,048 samples for keypoint recognition and morphological feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that the RTM-Det instance segmentation algorithm achieved robust performance metrics, with average precision rates of 94.69% and 91.84% for bounding boxes and masks respectively. The RTM-Pose keypoint detection system exhibited strong accuracy with a 90.59% average precision rate. Edge deployment evaluation revealed particularly favorable outcomes within the high posture score range (66-100), achieving a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6.53, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.08, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 3.63%, with a Coefficient of Determination (R2) of 0.82. The system demonstrated consistent performance across different hardware platforms, with inference times of 7.85 and 22.18 s on varying configurations, suggesting feasibility for deployment in commercial livestock management systems.

AB  - Simple Summary The housing patterns of gestating sows affect their health and welfare. In this study, the differences between behavior and stress hormone levels were assessed when sows were housed in a group housing system compared to individual stalls; in addition, the disease resistance and resilience of their piglets were compared. In our investigation, the group-housed sows showed more exploratory behavior, less vacuum chewing, less sitting behavior, and lower stress hormone levels throughout pregnancy. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection test revealed that the offspring of group-housed sows showed better resistance and resilience to disease. Therefore, the gestating sows raised in a group housing system and their piglets are healthier and have improved welfare. Our results show that a group housing system provides higher welfare standards, with conditions that are more suitable for gestating sows in modern pig production. Being in a confined environment causes chronic stress in gestating sows, which is detrimental for sow health, welfare and, consequently, offspring physiology. This study assessed the health and welfare of gestating sows housed in a group housing system compared to individual gestation stalls. After pregnancy was confirmed, experimental sows were divided randomly into two groups: the group housing system (GS), with the electronic sow feeding (ESF) system; or individual stall (IS). The behavior of sows housed in the GS or IS was then compared; throughout pregnancy, GS sows displayed more exploratory behavior, less vacuum chewing, and less sitting behavior (p < 0.05). IS sows showed higher stress hormone levels than GS sows. In particular, at 41 days of gestation, the concentration of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and adrenaline (A) in IS sows was significantly higher than that of GS sows, and the A level of IS sows remained significantly higher at 71 days of gestation (p < 0.01). The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) test was carried out in the weaned piglets of the studied sows. Compared with the offspring of gestating sows housed in GS (PG) or IS (PS), PG experienced a shorter period of high temperature and showed a quicker return to the normal state (p < 0.05). Additionally, their lower levels of stress hormone (p < 0.01) suggest that PG did not suffer from as much stress as PS. These findings suggested that gestating sows housed in GS were more able to carry out their natural behaviors and, therefore, had lower levels of stress and improved welfare. In addition, PG also showed better disease resistance and resilience. These results will provide a research basis for the welfare and breeding of gestating sows.

AB  - To enhance the sorption efficiency of heavy metals by modified biochar, biochars derived from pig manure at different pyrolyzing temperatures (300 degrees C, 500 degrees C and 700 degrees C) were oxidized and thiolated using H2O2 and 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, respectively. The physicochemical properties of biochars and sorption kinetics, isotherms, and mechanisms for Pb and Cd were studied. Oxidation and thiolation decreased the aromaticity and ash content, and increased the polarity and the specific surface area and pore volume of biochars. Oxidation introduced oxygen-containing functional groups into biochars, and the oxidation reaction took place at C=C bonds. The thiolation of oxidized biochar prepared at moderate-temperature had the highest sulfur content (4.43%) due to that this biochar was rich in oxygen-containing groups, which can act as the active sites for thiol groups loading. Sorption capacity of biochars for heavy metals increased by 2.58-4.22 times with the increase of pyrolyzing temperature, except the original biochar prepared at moderate-temperature, which had the highest Pb sorption capacity. The distribution coefficient of heavy metals onto modified biochars was enhanced by up to 85.4%. Oxidization treatment was more suitable for immobilization of low concentrations of Cd onto low- and moderate-temperatures biochars, while thiolation treatment was more suitable for immobilization of high concentrations of heavy metals. The sorption of heavy metals by biochars occurred via cation exchange, precipitation, cation-pi EDA interactions and complexation. The contribution percentage of complexing with functional groups increased after modification. The results suggest that oxidization and thiolation treatments of animal manure biochars are promising methods for the treatment of heavy metals polluted environment. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (Cytb) of the Japanese field vole (Microtus montebelli), an herbivorous rodent, was subjected to an analysis of sequence variation with the objective of elucidating the population histories of this species. Construction of a phylogenetic tree revealed the existence of several region-specific lineages in Honshu and Kyushu, which were evenly separated from each other. In consideration of the documented time-dependent evolutionary rates of rodents, the estimated divergence times indicate that the region-specific lineages of M. montebelli emerged 160,000-300,000 years ago. In a haplotype network, the region-specific lineages from northern and central Honshu tended to show star-shaped clusters, with additional internal star-shaped clusters, indicative of two periods of population expansion. The onsets of these expansions were estimated to have occurred 15,000 and 10,000 years ago, respectively, suggestive of association with the two periods of rapid warming following the last glacial maximum (LGM). In contrast, such predicted post-LGM expansion events were less pronounced in the southern lineages, implying latitudinal dependence of the effect of the LGM on population dynamics. Sado Island haplotypes exhibited a network with a star-shaped pattern and a 10,000-yearold expansion signal, surrounded by a Honshu haplotype cluster with a 15,000-year-old expansion signal, suggesting that post-LGM expansion events contributed to the formation of the Sado population. A reanalysis of Cytb sequences of the Japanese hare (Lepus brachyurus), which has a similar geographic range to the voles, yielded results that were consistent with those of the vole analysis, confirming that the characteristics of the post-LGM expansion event were dependent on latitude, involved two successive expansion events, and enabled migration across deep straits. It seems reasonable to infer that the environmental changes that occurred during the warm periods following the LGM were a contributing factor in the expansion of the distribution range of newly emerged haplotype groups.

AB  - An important component of post-release monitoring of biological control of invasive plants is the tracking of species interactions. During post-release monitoring following the initial releases of the weevil Ceutorhynchus scrobicollis Nerenscheimer and Wagner (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) on garlic mustard, Alliaria petiolata (Marschall von Bieberstein) Cavara and Grande (Brassicaceae), in Ontario, Canada, we identified the presence of larvae of the tumbling flower beetle, Mordellina ancilla Leconte (Coleoptera: Mordellidae), in garlic mustard stems. This study documents the life history of M. ancilla on garlic mustard to assess for potential interactions between M. ancilla and C. scrobicollis as a biological control agent. Garlic mustard stems were sampled at eight sites across southern Ontario and throughout the course of one year to record the prevalence of this association and to observe its life cycle on the plant. We found M. ancilla to be a widespread stem-borer of late second-year and dead garlic mustard plants across sampling locations. This is the first host record for M. ancilla on garlic mustard. The observed life cycle of M. ancilla indicates that it is unlikely to negatively impact the growth and reproduction of garlic mustard and that it is unlikely to affect the use of C. scrobicollis as a biological control agent.

Ceci est la premi & egrave;re fois que nous observons l'association entre C. scrobicollis et l'alliaire officinale. Nous confirmons que M. ancilla consomme la moelle des tiges de l'alliaire officinale vers la fin de la vie de cette plante bisanuelle et continue de consommer la moelle de la plante morte, & eacute;mergeant l'ann & eacute;e prochaine. Selon nos donn & eacute;es, il est improbable que M. ancilla ait un effet sur ni l'agent de lutte biologique C. scrobicollis, ni la croissance out la reproduction de l'alliaire officinale.

AB  - Albino tea cultivars have high economic value because their young leaves contain enhanced free amino acids that improve the quality and properties of tea. Zhonghuang 1 (ZH1) and Zhonghuang 2 (ZH2) are two such cultivars widely planted in China; however, the environmental factors and molecular mechanisms regulating their yellow-leaf phenotype remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that both ZH1 and ZH2 are light- and temperature-sensitive. Under natural sunlight and low-temperature conditions, their young shoots were yellow with decreased chlorophyll and an abnormal chloroplast ultrastructure. Conversely, young shoots were green with increased chlorophyll and a normal chloroplast ultrastructure under shading and high-temperature conditions. RNA-seq analysis was performed for high light and low light conditions, and pairwise comparisons identified genes exhibiting different light responses between albino and green-leaf cultivars, including transcription factors, cytochrome P450 genes, and heat shock proteins. Weighted gene coexpression network analyses of RNA-seq data identified the modules related to chlorophyll differences between cultivars. Genes involved in chloroplast biogenesis and development, light signaling, and JA biosynthesis and signaling were typically downregulated in albino cultivars, accompanied by a decrease in JA-ILE content in ZH2 during the albino period. Furthermore, we identified the hub genes that may regulate the yellow-leaf phenotype of ZH1 and ZH2, including CsGDC1, CsALB4, CsGUN4, and a TPR gene (TEA010575.1), which were related to chloroplast biogenesis. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying leaf color formation in albino tea cultivars.
   ZH1 and ZH2 were identified as light- and temperature-sensitive albino tea cultivars. WGCNAidentified hub genes regulating the albino phenotype of ZH1 and ZH2.

AB  - Extracellular senile plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles are two devastating brain proteinopathies that are indicative of Alzheimer's disease, the most prevalent type of dementia. Currently, no effective medications are available to stop or reverse Alzheimer's disease. Ginkgo biloba extract, commonly referred to as EGb 761, is a natural product made from the leaves of the G. biloba tree. It has long been demonstrated to have therapeutic benefits in Alzheimer's disease. The current study assessed the beneficial effects of EGb 761 against Alzheimer's disease in comparison with memantine, a standard treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The scopolamine-heavy metals mixture rat Alzheimer's disease model is a newly created model to study the effects of EGb 761 oral therapy on cognitive performance and other Alzheimer's disease-like changes over a 28-day experimental period. This new Alzheimer's disease model provides better criteria for Alzheimer's disease hallmarks than the conventional scopolamine model. The EGb 761 reversed memory and learning deficits induced by the scopolamine-heavy metals mixture. These outcomes were linked to a more pronounced inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase, caspase-3, hippocampal amyloid-beta protein (A beta 1 - 42), phosphorylated tau protein counts, and proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor- alpha and interleukin-1 beta ) compared to the memantine-treated group. Furthermore, EGb 761 treatment considerably reduced lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) and improved reduced glutathione levels compared to memantine. Our results suggest EGb 761 ' s potential in treating central nervous system disorders. It's a promising candidate for future Alzheimer's disease therapeutic exploration. This study also highlights the need for future research to focus on the positive benefits of herbal medicines.

AB  - The function of medial entorhinal cortex layer II (MECII) excitatory neurons has been recently explored. MECII dysfunction underlies deficits in spatial navigation and working memory. MECII neurons comprise two major excitatory neuronal populations, pyramidal island and stellate ocean cells, in addition to the inhibitory interneurons. Ocean cells express reelin and surround clusters of island cells that lack reelin expression. The influence of reelin expression by ocean cells and interneurons on theirown morphological differentiation and that of MECII island cells has remained unknown. To address this, we used a conditional reelin knockout (Reln cKO ) mouse to induce reelin deficiency postnatally in vitro and in vivo . Reelin deficiency caused dendritic hypertrophy of ocean cells, interneurons and only proximal dendritic compartments of island cells. Ca 2+ recording showed that both cell types exhibited an elevation of calcium frequencies in Reln cKO , indicating that the hypertrophic effect is related to excessive Ca 2+ signalling. Moreover, pharmacological receptor blockade in Reln cKO mouse revealed malfunctioning of GABA B , NMDA and AMPA receptors. Collectively, this study emphasizes the significance of reelin in neuronal growth, and its absence results in dendrite hypertrophy of MECII neurons.

AB  - A catalogue of natural enemies considered and released as biological control (biocontrol) agents against invasive alien plants in South Africa has been maintained for many years, and is updated here to include the period 2011-2020. The current catalogue reorders and separates data for exotic natural enemies that have been approved as classical biocontrol agents, from those on exotic natural enemies that have been considered but not released, exotic natural enemies that have been inadvertently introduced into South Africa with host plants that include target weed species, and locally sourced natural enemies that have been considered as bioherbicides. Ninety weed species have been targeted for biocontrol, with 310 exotic natural enemies considered, 136 classified as de jure or de facto classical biocontrol agents, and 92 established in the field on 66 target weeds. Ten of these species were found to have established independently of being released while research on them was in progress. An additional six exotic species have been found established on target weeds, and 11 locally sourced natural enemies have been considered for inundative or augmentative biocontrol, of which two have been developed commercially. Of the exotic natural enemies deliberately established, 35% inflict extensive damage to their host plants. Insects make up the majority of biocontrol agents (90%), with the balance of 8% being fungi and 2%, mites. Both establishment rates and damage levels vary between taxa. Five biocontrol agents previously considered established, have not been found in the field for several years and their persistence is in doubt. Outcomes of biocontrol at a plant population level are indicated for 54 target weeds on which agents have been established for over a decade. The increase in numbers of target weeds considered, as well as biocontrol agents released, over the past decade, has been enabled by continued generous funding and an efficient release-approval process.

TI  - deepNGS navigator: exploring antibody NGS datasets using deep contrastive learning
T2  - BIOINFORMATICS
LA  - English
AB  - Motivation High-throughput sequencing uncovers how B-cells adapt in response to antigens by generating B-cell-receptor (BCR) sequences at an unprecedented scale. As BCR datasets grow to millions of sequences, using efficient computational methods becomes crucial. One important aspect of antibody sequence analysis is detecting clonal families or clusters of related sequences, whether they come from immunization, synthetic-libraries or even ML-generated datasets.Results We introduce deepNGS Navigator, a computational tool that leverages language models and contrastive learning to transform antibody sequences into intuitive 2D representations. The resulting 2D maps offer a visualization of overall diversity of input datasets, which can be clustered based on the sequence distances and their densities across the map. Beyond grouping related sequences, the 2D maps also represent mutational patterns inferred from sequence embeddings, enabling trajectory analysis and clustering within the projected space. By overlaying properties such as charge, the map helps identify clusters of interest for further investigation while also flagging potentially noisy or non-specific sequences with higher risk. We demonstrate deepNGS Navigator's utilities on several datasets, including: (i) a synthetic-library from a yeast-display targeting HER2, (ii) a machine learning-generated dataset with a hierarchical structure, (iii) NGS sequences from a llama immunized against COVID RBD, (iv) human naive and memory B-cell sequences, and (v) an in silico dataset simulating B-cell clonal lineages.Availability and implementation The deepNGS Navigator source code is available at: github.com/prescient-design/deepngs-navigator and github.com/prescient-design/deepngs-navigator-panel-app.

AB  - Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) are a large-bodied species of flatfish that are important culturally, economically, and as a key predator in marine systems in the USA and Canada. The species has a wide distribution, and complex life history including large-scale migrations to spawn and feed, making it potentially susceptible to climate change impacts. We examined the potential changes in halibut distribution and relative abundance that may arise from changing temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations using species distribution models (SDMs) and future climate scenarios downscaled by two regional ocean models. SDMs were fit with both environmental variables (depth, near-bottom temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration) and spatial random field components (representing unknown habitat-related variables). The best-fitting models, trained on data from 2009 to 2013, were able to account for 33 % and 53 % of the variation in small and large halibut catch-per-unit-effort in the annual set-line survey data from 2014 to 2020. The results suggest that the response of Pacific halibut to climate change in British Columbia and Washington waters is likely to depend on changes in dissolved oxygen concentration. Pacific halibut appear sensitive to changes in dissolved oxygen, yet relatively tolerant to increases in temperature. Projections for 2046-2065 period suggest that future decreases in near-bottom dissolved oxygen in shallow waters that small halibut inhabit are likely to result in moderate decreases in relative abundance. Projected changes in relative abundance are less certain for large Pacific halibut, due to disagreement in the regional ocean models near-bottom dissolved oxygen projections at mid depths (300-600 m) where large Pacific halibut are more common. Overall, the relative abundance of Pacific halibut is expected to decrease in most areas of British Columbia. Future management strategies will need to account for the projected changes in distribution and abundance and their uncertainty.

AB  - INGA FOOD, S.A. initiated a crossbreeding program between two Iberian pig varieties, Retinto (R) and Entrepelado (E), with the goal of producing a hybrid sow (F1). Several studies have been conducted to evaluate its productive performance, and these studies have revealed differences in litter size between the two reciprocal crosses, suggesting the presence of genomic imprinting effects. To further investigate these effects, this study introduces a multivariate gametic model designed to estimate gametic correlations between paternal and maternal effects originating from both genetic backgrounds involved in the reciprocal crosses. The dataset consisted of 1258 records (the total number born-TNB and the number born alive-NBA) from 203 crossbred dams for the Entrepelado (sire) x Retinto (dam) cross and 700 records from 125 crossbred dams for the Retinto (sire) x Entrepelado (dam) cross. All animals were genotyped using the GeneSeek((R)) GPP Porcine 70 K HDchip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The results indicated that the posterior distribution of the gametic correlation between paternal and maternal effects was distinctly different between the two populations. Specifically, in the Retinto population, the gametic correlation showed a positive skew with posterior probabilities of 0.78 for the TNB and 0.80 for the NBA. On the other hand, the Entrepelado population showed a posterior probability of a positive gametic correlation between paternal and maternal effects of approximately 0.50. The differences in the shape of the posterior distribution of the gametic correlations between paternal and maternal effects observed in the two varieties may account for the distinct performance outcomes observed in the reciprocal crosses.

AB  - IntroductionMesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) are central in immune anatomy. MLNs are associated with the composition of gut microbiota, affecting the central system and immune system. Gut microbiota was found to differ among individuals of different social hierarchies. Nowadays, excision of MLNs is more frequently involved in gastrointestinal surgery; however, the potential side effects of excision of MLNs on social dominance are still unknown. MethodsMLNs were removed from male mice (7-8 weeks old). Four weeks after MLN removal, social dominance test was performed to investigate social dominance; hippocampal and serum interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were investigated; and histopathology was used to evaluate local inflammation of the ileum. The composition of the gut microbiota was then examined to understand the possible mechanism, and finally intraperitoneal injection of IL-10 was used to validate the effect of IL-10 on social dominance. ResultsThere was a decrease in social dominance in the operation group compared to the control group, as well as a decrease in serum and hippocampal IL-10 levels, but no difference in serum and hippocampal IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha levels, and no local inflammation of the ileum after MLN removal. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis showed that the relative abundance of the class Clostridia was decreased in the operation group. This decrease was positively associated with serum IL-10 levels. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of IL-10 in a subset of mice increased social dominance. ConclusionsOur findings suggested that MLNs contributed to maintaining social dominance, which might be associated with reduced IL-10 and the imbalance of specific flora in gut microbiota.

AB  - Porcine steroid hormone profiles have some unique characteristics. We previously studied human and murine steroidogenesis using steroidogenic cells-derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). To investigate porcine steroidogenesis, we induced steroidogenic cells from porcine subcutaneous preadipocytes (PSPA cells), which originate from MSCs. Using cAMP, adenovirus-mediated introduction of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1)/adrenal 4binding protein (Ad4BP) induced the differentiation of PSPA cells into sex steroid-producing cells. Introducing SF-1/Ad4BP also induced the aldo-keto reductase 1C1 (AKR1C1) gene. Porcine AKR1C1 had 178-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, which converts androstenedione and 11-ketoandrostenedione into testosterone (T) and 11-ketotestosteorne (11KT). Furthermore, differentiated cells expressed hydroxysteroid 118-dehydrogenase 2 (HSD11B2) and produced 11KT. HSD11B2 was expressed in testicular Leydig cells and the adrenal cortex. 11KT was present in the plasma of both immature male and female pigs, with slightly higher levels in the male pigs. T levels were much higher in the male pigs. It is noteworthy that in the female pigs, the 11KT levels were >10-fold higher than the T levels. However, castration altered the 11KT and T plasma profiles in the male pigs to near those of the females. 11KT induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in porcine vascular endothelial cells. These results indicate that 11KT is produced in porcine adrenal glands and testes, and may regulate cardiovascular functions through eNOS expression.

AB  - IntroductionMaternal nicotine use has been suggested to affect the behavior of children and is linked to changes in neurological systems; however, the specific mechanism is yet to be understood. MethodsMice were used to establish a maternal nicotine intoxication model. At postnatal day 60 (adolescent stage), male offspring were tested for behavioral tasks including sucrose preference, open field, elevated plus maze, light/dark box, object recognition, Morris water maze (MWM), and forced swimming. Enzyme-linked immunoassays were used to measure plasma concentrations of neurotransmitters including norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and corticosterone. Serotonin transporter (Sert), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), cAMP response element binding protein (Creb), and phosphorylated (p)Creb mRNA levels were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. ResultsMale offspring of nicotine-intoxicated dams had significantly reduced sucrose preference, mobility time in the forced swimming test, and locomotor and exploratory activities. Offspring in the maternal nicotine intoxication group showed increased signs of depressive- and anxiety-like behavior. Recognition memory in the MWM was compromised in these animals. The hippocampal and prefrontal cortical regions showed significant changes in Bdnf, pCreb, and Sert gene expression, whereas CREB mRNA levels were unaffected. Moreover, compared to the controls, neurogenesis and neuronal viability were also reduced in these animals. ConclusionPrenatal nicotine exposure might affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and reduce neurogenesis, potentially leading to depressive-like behaviors and cognitive deficiencies in male offspring.

AB  - IntroductionEpilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases, while over one third of adults with epilepsy still have inadequate seizure control. Although mutations in salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) have been identified in epileptic encephalopathy, it is not known whether blocking SIKs can prevent pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures.MethodsWe first determined the time course of SIKs (including SIK 1, 2, and 3) in the hippocampus of PTZ treated mice. And then, we evaluated the effects of anti-epilepsy drug valproate acid (VPA) on the expression of SIK 1, 2, and 3 in the hippocampus of PTZ treated mice. Next, we investigated the effect of different dose of SIKs inhibitor YKL-06-061 on the epileptic seizures and neuronal activation by determining the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) in the PTZ treated mice.ResultsWe found that PTZ selectively induced enhanced expression of SIK1 in the hippocampus, which was blocked by VPA treatment. Notably, YKL-06-061 decreased seizure activity and prevented neuronal overactivity, as indicated by the reduced expression of IEGs in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.ConclusionOur findings provide the first evidence that SIK1 affects gene regulation in neuronal hyperactivity, which is involved in seizure behavior. Targeting SIK1 through the development of selective inhibitors may lead to disease-modifying therapies that reduce epilepsy progression.
   A schematic illustration of the proposed mechanism for YKL-06-061 prevents PTZ-induced seizures in mice. PTZ induces high expression of SIK1, leading IEGs overexpression and appearing seizure behavior in mice. SIKs inhibitors (YKL-06-061) reduce the expression of IEGs, thereby improving epilepsy of mice.image

AB  - Simple Summary The main aim of this preliminary study was to evaluate the effects of replacing soybean meal with lupins on carcass traits, meat characteristics, meat characteristics, and meat fatty acid profile in lambs. Two trials were conducted: In trial 1, the soybean meal was partially replaced by Lupinus albus or Lupinus luteus; in trial 2, lambs were fed four diets with graded levels of Lupinus luteus, ranging from 0 to 200 g/kg. The lambs were slaughtered to evaluate carcass characteristics, meat composition, and fatty acids profile. Carcass composition was not affected (p > 0.05) by diet in both trials. Meat quality attributes did not vary (p < 0.05) between trials 1 and 2. Overall, fatty acid content was not affected by diet (p > 0.05) in both trials. Soybean meal produced the same results as lupins in this study, indicating the latter as a potential alternative protein source, although research should focus on meat palatability. The objective of this preliminary study was to evaluate the effects of partial replacement of soybean meal by lupins on lambs' diets, on the carcass traits, meat characteristics, and meat fatty acid profile. Two trials were conducted: In trial 1, the soybean meal (control; C) was partially replaced by Lupinus albus or Lupinus luteus (50 g/kg; LA5 and LL5, respectively); in trial 2, lambs were fed four diets with graded levels of Lupinus luteus (0, 100, 150 and 200 g/kg; C, LL10, LL15, LL20, respectively). At the end of the feeding trials, animals were slaughtered to evaluate carcass characteristics and meat composition, including fatty acids. Carcass composition in tissues was not affected (p > 0.05) by diet in both trials. Additionally, no significant (p < 0.05) differences were observed in meat quality attributes between diets in trials 1 and 2. Overall, the Longissimus muscle's fatty acid content was not affected by diet (p > 0.05) in both trials. Carcass and meat quality was overall comparable between lambs fed with soybean meal and lupins, indicating the latter as a potential alternative protein source. However, the lack of significant differences could also be attributed to the small sample size.

AB  - Introduction: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has put some health systems under pressure, especially in low- and middle-income countries. We aimed at evaluating the impact of COVID-19 emergency on the management of people with epilepsy (PWE) living in the rural communities of the Gran Chaco area of the Plurinational State of Bolivia.
   Materials and methods: We selected a sample of PWE living in the rural communities of the Bolivian Chaco. A standardized questionnaire was developed, consisting of six questions addressing drug availability, drug discontinuation, personnel responsible for drug retrieval during the lockdown, and the presence of seizures in the two months preceding the interview. Questionnaires were administered by community health workers of the rural health centers in September 2020.
   Results: Seventy PWE (38 men, 54.3%; mean age 26.9 +/- 16.7) were interviewed. During the lockdown the large majority of them (n = 51, 73.9%) reported an irregular medication intake mainly due to the lack of antiseizure medications in the local health posts, leading to an increase in seizure frequency.
   Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has unmasked the frailty of the Bolivian health system, especially for the management of chronic diseases such as epilepsy in the rural communities. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary Post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) caused the destruction of tight junction and epithelial cells, resulting in the increased gut permeability of pathogenic E.coli, and the reduction of the growth performance. Stimbiotic (STB), while generating specific Xylo-oligosaccharides and a positive effect on gut health, has been introduced as an antibiotics alternative. This study evaluated the effect in weaned piglets of experimentally induced PWD. Our results showed that the pigs were challenged by Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC). STB significantly increased the growth performance, immunity and intestinal health compared with the non-supplemented group. Therefore, STB can be used as an effective additive for weaned piglets. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of stimbiotic (STB), a xylanase and xylo-oligosaccharide complex. A total of 36 male weaned pigs with initial body weights of 8.49 +/- 0.10 kg were used in a 3-week experiment. The experiment was conducted in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement (six replicates/treatment) of treatments consisting of two levels of challenge (challenge and non-challenge) and three levels of STB (0, 0.5, and 1 g/kg diet). Supplementations STB 0.5 g/kg (STB5) and STB 1 g/kg (STB10) improved the G:F (p = 0.04) in piglets challenged with STEC. STB supplementation, which also decreased (p < 0.05) the white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. Supplementations STB5 and STB10 improved (p < 0.01) the lymphocytes and neutrophils in piglets challenged with STEC on 14 dpi. Additionally, supplementations STB5 and STB10 improved (p < 0.01) the tumor necrosis factor-alpha in piglets challenged with STEC on 3 dpi. Supplementations STB5 and STB10 also improved the villus height-to-crypt depth ratio (p < 0.01) in piglets challenged with STEC. Supplementation with STB reduced (p < 0.05) the expression levels of calprotectin. In conclusion, STB could alleviate a decrease of the performance, immune response, and inflammatory response induced by the STEC challenge.

AB  - Robust visual analysis of pigs in densely housed groups is essential for various applications within digital phenotyping and Precision Livestock Farming, including animal counting, posture recognition, tracking, body dimension measurement, and welfare assessment. However, the transferability and scalability of existing methods across diverse farming environments remain significant challenges. In this study, we addressed these issues by proposing a modular design that decouples environmental variations from individual animal variability. At the framework-level, we introduced a Rotated Bounding Box (RBB) detector combined with an Auto-Visual Prompt strategy to effectively suppress background interference and achieve seamless scene adaptation. At the task-level, we developed a Multi-task Super-Resolution Network (MT-SRnet) capable of simultaneously predicting pig keypoints, masks, and postures from low-resolution inputs. Our experimental results demonstrate that MT-SRnet maintains high accuracy (Keypoints-95.33 % mPCK; Mask-95.53 % mIoU; posture-89.72 % accuracy) while substantially reducing model complexity by over 30-fold. Moreover, the proposed approach achieves a substantial increase in inference speed (up to similar to 17,000 pigs/s), highlighting its practical suitability for real-time monitoring under resource-limited conditions.

AB  - Introduction Since December 2019, a serious health crisis caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2 affected all aspects of human lives. The available data about COVID-19-associated Rhino-Orbital-Cerebral Mucormycosis (CA-ROCM) survival issues are based on studies on small populations with limited follow-up durations. Therefore, this multicenter cohort of a large population with CA-ROCM is aiming to report the one-year survival rate and investigate the potential responsible risk factors affecting the mortality.<br /> Materials and Methods This prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study included CA-ROCM patients from eight tertiary ophthalmology centers across Iran. Demographic, clinical, and therapeutic data were collected and patients were followed for a year. Survival analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards models to identify mortality-associated risk factors. The research protocol is also available on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05097664).<br /> Results Among the 246 patients, 183 (74.4%) survived within a year and 63 (25.6%) died. Significant mortality risk factors included need for orbital exenteration (HR = 3.01 vs. other treatments, p = 0.019), advanced disease stage (HR = 2.43 stage IV vs. II, p = 0.02), age (HR = 1.05, p < 0.001), and diabetes duration (HR = 1.05, p = 0.002). Paradoxically, steroid administration for COVID management was associated with improved survival (HR = 2.72 for no steroids, p = 0.018).<br /> Discussion COVID-19-associated Rhino-Orbital-Cerebral Mucormycosis carries a substantial one-year survival rate of 74.4% in Iran. Age, diabetes, advanced disease stage, and need for orbital exenteration are the probable fatal risk factors. Interestingly, administration of steroids for COVID management was associated with a better survival.

AB  - Hydatid disease is a neglected zoonotic parasitic disease caused by cysts of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. Canids, especially domestic dogs, are definitive hosts of the parasite and are the most pragmatic targets for control programs. A governmental dog deworming campaign was established in 1979 to control hydatidosis in southern Chile, which succeeded in reducing the prevalence of canine echinococcosis in Tierra del Fuego province from 68.4% (in 1978) to 1.2% (in 2002). In 2004, however, the program was dismantled to reduce costs, and since then, no follow-up echinococcosis monitoring has been conducted. We surveyed 356 domestic dogs and interviewed owners or workers at 45 ranches in Chilean Tierra del Fuego during the summer of 2015-2016. Faecal flotation was employed to detect Taeniidae eggs, and PCR was used to test faecal samples for Echinococcus granulosus. Taeniidae eggs and Echinococcus sp. DNA were detected in the faeces of 45.4% (147/324) and 6.9% (23/331) of dogs, respectively. Infrequent dog deworming and the presence of culpeo foxes (Lycalopex culpaeus) were significant predictors of the prevalence of Echinococcus sp. DNA and Taeniidae eggs. Furthermore, the presence of introduced chilla foxes (Lycalopex griseus), the municipality, and several operational characteristics of ranches (number of sheep, frequency of sheep slaughter, number of dogs, frequency of removal of dog faeces, feeding of dogs with sheep viscera) were also predictive of the prevalence of Taeniidae eggs. Our findings reveal an ongoing risk of echinococcosis with pathogen maintenance in ranch dogs in Chilean Tierra del Fuego, and in the absence of adequate control programmes, there is a tangible risk of re-emergence of hydatid disease as a public health concern.

AB  - Genetically modified pigs are very useful thanks to their applications in basic research, biomedicine, and meat production. There are different methods for producing them, including cloning and the microinjection or electroporation of oocytes and zygotes. Easier techniques are being developed, such as lipofection, which involves the encapsulation of the CRISPR/Cas9 system into vesicles that are introduced into cells. We compared the embryo development and mutation rates associated with different conditions of lipofection treatment with the electroporation technique in zona-pellucida-intact porcine oocytes. We found that the lipofection treatment, once optimized, was as effective as the electroporation technique in terms of the embryo development and mutation rates. In addition, an increment in the concentration in the media of the liposomes-CRISPR/Cas9 system complexes had a detrimental effect on the embryo development parameters, which could indicate a possible toxic effect. The achievement of generating mutant embryos via lipofection without removing the zona pellucida could open up a new, easy, and cheap way of producing genetically modified pigs.
   The generation of genetically modified pigs has an important impact thanks its applications in basic research, biomedicine, and meat production. Cloning was the first technique used for this production, although easier and cheaper methods were developed, such as the microinjection, electroporation, or lipofection of oocytes and zygotes. In this study, we analyzed the production of genetically modified embryos via lipofection of zona-pellucida-intact oocytes using Lipofectamine (TM) CRISPRMAX (TM) Cas9 in comparison with the electroporation method. Two factors were evaluated: (i) the increment in the concentration of the lipofectamine-ribonucleoprotein complexes (LRNPC) (5% vs. 10%) and (ii) the concentration of ribonucleoprotein within the complexes (1xRNP vs. 2xRNP). We found that the increment in the concentration of the LRNPC had a detrimental effect on embryo development and a subsequent effect on the number of mutant embryos. The 5% group had a similar mutant blastocyst rate to the electroporation method (5.52% and 6.38%, respectively, p > 0.05). The increment in the concentration of the ribonucleoprotein inside the complexes had no effect on the blastocyst rate and mutation rate, with the mutant blastocyst rate being similar in both the 1xRNP and 2xRNP lipofection groups and the electroporation group (1.75%, 3.60%, and 3.57%, respectively, p > 0.05). Here, we showed that it is possible to produce knock-out embryos via lipofection of zona-pellucida-intact porcine oocytes with similar efficiencies as with electroporation, although more optimization is needed, mainly in terms of the use of more efficient vesicles for encapsulation with different compositions.

AB  - Species of the digenean genus Enenterum Linton, 1910 (Lepocreadioidea: Enenteridae) are characterised primarily by their elaborate oral suckers, which are divided into varying numbers of anteriorly directed lobes, and their host-restriction to herbivorous marine fishes of the family Kyphosidae. We describe Enenterum petrae n. sp. from the brassy chub Kyphosus vaigiensis (Quoy & Gaimard) collected off Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia. Enenterum petrae n. sp. is readily differentiated from congeners by its unique oral sucker morphology, in having a minute pharynx, and the combination of a genital cap and accessory sucker. We also provide the first record of Enenterum kyphosi Yamaguti, 1970 from Australia based on material obtained from the blue sea chub Kyphosus cinerascens (Forssk??l) collected off Lizard Island and North Stradbroke Island, Queensland. Morphologically, our specimens of E. kyphosi agree closely with descriptions of this species from Hawaii and South Africa, and despite lack of molecular data from outside of Australian waters, we consider all three reports to represent a single, widespread species. The first ITS2 and COI mtDNA gene sequences for species of Enenterum are provided and molecular phylogenetic analyses of 28S rDNA gene sequences place these species in a strongly-supported clade with the type-species of the genus, Enenterum aureum Linton, 1910. The oral suckers of both E. kyphosi and E. petrae n. sp. can be interpreted as having varying numbers of lobes depending on the particular specimen and how the division between lobes is defined. Scanning electron microscopical images improves understanding of the morphology of the enenterid oral sucker, and permits speculation regarding the evolutionary history leading to its specialisation in this lineage.

AB  - Tomato produces a number of terpenes in their glandular trichomes that contribute to host plant resistance against pests. While glandular trichomes of cultivated tomato Solanum lycopersicum primarily accumulate a blend of monoterpenes, those of the wild tomato species Solanum habrochaites produce various sesquiterpenes. Recently, we have identified two groups of sesquiterpenes in S. habrochaites accessions that negatively affect the performance and choice behavior of the potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae). Aphids are piercing-sucking herbivores that use their mouthpart to penetrate and probe plant tissues in order to ultimately access vascular tissue and ingest phloem sap. Because secondary metabolites produced in glandular trichomes can affect the initial steps of the aphid feeding behavior, introducing the formation of defensive terpenes into additional plant tissues via metabolic engineering has the potential to reduce tissue penetration by aphids and in consequence virus transmission. Here, we have developed two multicistronic expression constructs based on the two sesquiterpene traits with activity toward M. euphorbiae previously identified in S. habrochaites. Both constructs are composed of sequences encoding a prenyl transferase and a respective S. habrochaites terpene synthase, as well as enhanced green fluorescent protein as a visible marker. All three coding sequences were linked by short nucleotide sequences encoding the foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A self-processing oligopeptide which allows their co-expression under the control of one promoter. Transient expression of both constructs under the epidermis-specific Arabidopsis CER5-promoter in tomato leaves demonstrated that formation of the two sets of defensive sesquiterpenes, beta-caryophyllene/alpha-humulene and (-)-endo-alpha-bergamotene/(+)-alpha-santalene/(+)-endo-beta-bergamotene, can be introduced into new tissues in tomato. The epidermis-specific transgene expression and terpene formation were verified by fluorescence microscopy and tissue fractionation with subsequent analysis of terpene profiles, respectively. In addition, the longevity and fecundity of M. euphorbiae feeding on these engineered tomato leaves were significantly reduced, demonstrating the efficacy of this novel aphid control strategy.

AB  - The global livestock production system faces significant challenges for sustainable development, including feed resource shortage and environmental pressures. Precision animal nutrition is crucial in addressing these challenges, in which the mathematical model is an indispensable tool. The traditional mathematical models exhibit certain limitations, particularly in accommodating the emerging demands of precision nutrition and feeding for individuals. New technologies, especially big data and artificial intelligence (AI), have shown great potential to mitigate the above shortcomings. This review has summarized the current landscape and applications of big data and AI-powered modeling in animal nutrition and feeding, covering techniques including intelligent data acquisition, in vitro kinetics and multi-omics data mining, data augmentation, advanced and explainable machine learning algorithms, multi-objective and heuristic algorithms, and life cycle assessment-based sustainability evaluation with case studies in pigs and alternative feed ingredients. Furthermore, this review has introduced the next-generation model techniques, including those based on large language models, multi-agents, and embodied AI robots, depicted the potential translation of the advancements from animal nutrition to human health, and discussed the limitations of AI-powered modeling techniques. These pioneering techniques will provide new tools and paradigms for research and practices in animal nutrition and further promote animal husbandry's sustainable development.

AB  - This study provides the first comprehensive investigation of the residual concentrations of eight classes of antimicrobial agents (AMs, 20 compounds) in 13 swine wastewater treatment facilities in Japan. These facilities implemented the aerobic activated sludge (AS) or its alternative methods. The maximum concentrations before treatment were found at the level of 7100, 6900, 6000, 3600, 3400, and 1400 mu g/L for tilmicosin, oxytetracycline (OTC), chlortetracycline, lincomycin , sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim, respectively. The highest detection rate (96.3%) in influents was noted for the morantel, which was a feed additive. The seasonal difference in residual concentration was much greater for tetracyclines (TCs) and macrolides (MLs) when their residual concentrations were high, especially in the cold season. There was a positive correlation between the purchased quantity of TCs and fluoroquinolones (FQs) and their residue levels detected in the effluents (p < 0.01). The estimated removal rate of AMs was greater than 80%. In contrast, on a few occasions, it was diminished due to failing operating conditions, such as water temperature and AS rate in the aeration tank. The estimated ecological risks of AMs in effluents based on risk quotients (RQs) considered to enhance the selection pressure for drug resistance (RQs-AMR) were high for TCs and FQs, whereas ecotoxicological effects (RQs-ENV) to aquatic organisms were higher for sulfonamides and MLs. When OTC usage ceased, its concentration in wastewater decreased rapidly; however, it remained longer period in the effluents, probably due to OTC desorption from the AS. The concentrations (and respective RQs) of TCs were decreased by >99.8% and >92% in the influents and effluents, respectively. This data suggested that it is essential to reduce the amount used and introduce more efficient methods and operating conditions to constantly remove AMs during the treatment to reduce the risk of AM discharge from swine farms.

AB  - The rising popularity of ecotourism on the Tibetan Plateau has intensified the tension between wildlife conservation and economic development. Conventional wildlife displays often fail to achieve high-fidelity, non-invasive representations of animal morphology and typically lack immersive, interactive features, limiting public engagement in ecological protection. To address these limitations, this study presents a fur simulation algorithm based on the Texture Procedural Overlay Technique (TPOT), integrated with Augmented Reality (AR) technology, focusing on the endangered white-lipped deer in the Sanjiangyuan region. The proposed TPOT-based algorithm enhances the visual realism of fur through multi-layered procedural texturing and physical property fusion. Combined with an AR-driven interactive framework, it seamlessly integrates high-resolution 3D models into real-world environments, significantly improving user immersion and engagement. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the approach surpasses traditional static display fidelity and animation rendering efficiency methods. User feedback further validates its effectiveness for scientific research and environmental education. This work introduces an innovative technological solution for wildlife conservation on the Tibetan Plateau and provides a practical reference for applying digital technologies in ecotourism.

AB  - The H11 antigens, located on the intestinal microvilli of Haemonchus contortus, comprise a group of homologous aminopeptidases essential for the parasite's digestion of blood meals. Native H11 proteins are promising vaccine antigens, capable of eliciting robust protective immunity against H. contortus in sheep and goats. However, recombinant forms of H11, produced either in conventional expression systems or in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans, failed to replicate the protective efficacy of the native form, most likely due to two critical factors: improper glycosylation and protein misfolding. To address these limitations, we developed a novel strategy to produce recombinant Haemonchus antigens in glycoengineered insect cells. By introducing three C. elegans genes that alter the native N-glycosylation pathways of Hi5 insect cells we successfully expressed soluble H11 and GA1 antigens featuring nematode-specific glycan epitopes, including tri-fucosylated structures and the Gal beta 1,4Fuc motif. The glycoengineered H11 proteins retained aminopeptidase activity and stimulated cytokine secretion from ovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. These findings establish a platform for producing bioactive vaccine antigens against the parasitic nematode H. contortus.

AB  - An outstanding issue in the study of insect host races concerns the idea of 'recursive adaptive divergence', whereby adaptation can occur repeatedly across space and/or time, and the most recent adaptive episode is defined by one or more previously similar cases. The host plant shift of the apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh) (Diptera: Tephritidae, Carpomyini), from ancestral downy hawthorn [Crataegus mollis (Torr. & A. Gray) Scheele] to introduced, domesticated apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) in the eastern USA has long served as a model system for investigating ecologically driven host race formation in phytophagous insect specialists. Here, we report results from an annual geography survey of eclosion time demonstrating a similar ecological pattern among nascent host-associated populations of the fly recently introduced ca. 40 years ago from its native range in the east into the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region of the USA. Specifically, using data collected from 25 locations across 5 years, we show that apple-infesting fly populations in the PNW have rapidly and repeatedly shifted (and maintained differences in) their adult eclosion life-history timing to infest two novel hawthorn hosts with different fruiting phenologies - a native species (Crataegus douglasii Lindl.) and an introduced species (Crataegus monogyna Jacq.) - generating partial allochronic reproductive isolation in the process. The shifts in the PNW parallel the classic case of host race formation in the eastern USA, but have occurred bi-directionally to two hawthorn species with phenologies slightly earlier (black hawthorn) and significantly later (ornamental hawthorn) than apple. Our results imply that R. pomonella can both possess and retain extensive-standing variation (i.e., 'adaptive memory') in diapause traits, even following introductions, to rapidly and temporally track novel phenological host opportunities when they arise. Thus, 'specialized' host races may not constitute evolutionary dead ends. Rather, adaptive phenotypic and genetic memory may carry over from one host shift to the next, recursively facilitating host race formation in phytophagous insects.

AB  - Myocardial injury leads to an irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes (CM). The implantation of human engineered heart tissue (EHT) has become a promising regenerative approach. Previous studies exhibited beneficial, dose -dependent effects of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived EHT patch transplantation in a guinea pig model in the subacute phase of myocardial injury. Yet, advanced heart failure often results from a chronic remodeling process. Therefore, from a clinical standpoint it is worthwhile to explore the ability to repair the chronically injured heart. In this study human EHT patches were generated from hiPSC-derived CMs (15 x 10(6) cells) and implanted epicardially four weeks after injury in a guinea pig cryo-injury model. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography after a follow-up period of four weeks. Hearts revealed large transmural myocardial injuries amounting to 27% of the left ventricle. EHT recipient hearts demonstrated compact muscle islands of human origin in the scar region, as indicated by a positive staining for human Ku80 and dystrophin, remuscularizing 5% of the scar area. Echocardiographic analysis demonstrated no significant functional differ-ence between animals that received EHT patches and animals in the cell-free control group (fractional area change 36% vs. 34%). Thus, EHT patches engrafted in the chronically injured heart but in contrast to the sub-acute model, grafts were smaller and EHT patch transplantation did not improve left ventricular function, highlighting the difficulties for a regenerative approach.

AB  - Xylariomycetidae (Ascomycota) is a highly diversified group with variable stromatic characters. Our research focused on inconspicuous stromatic xylarialean taxa from China, Italy, Russia, Thailand and the United Kingdom. Detailed morphological descriptions, illustrations and combined ITS-LSU-rpb2-tub2-tef1 phylogenies revealed 39 taxa from our collections belonging to Amphisphaeriales and Xylariales. A new family (Appendicosporaceae), five new genera (Magnostiolata, Melanostictus, Neoamphisphaeria, Nigropunctata and Paravamsapriya), 27 new species (Acrocordiella photiniicola, Allocryptovalsa sichuanensis, Amphisphaeria parvispora, Anthostomella lamiacearum, Apiospora guiyangensis, A. sichuanensis, Biscogniauxia magna, Eutypa camelliae, Helicogermslita clypeata, Hypocopra zeae, Magnostiolata mucida, Melanostictus longiostiolatus, M. thailandicus, Nemania longipedicellata, N. delonicis, N. paraphysata, N. thailandensis, Neoamphisphaeria hyalinospora, Neoanthostomella bambusicola, Nigropunctata bambusicola, N. nigrocircularis, N. thailandica, Occultitheca rosae, Paravamsapriya ostiolata, Peroneutypa leucaenae, Seiridium italicum and Vamsapriya mucosa) and seven new host/geographical records are introduced and reported. Divergence time estimates indicate that Delonicicolales diverged from Amphisphaeriales + Xylariales at 161 (123-197) MYA. Amphisphaeriales and Xylariales diverged 154 (117-190) MYA with a crown age of 127 (92-165) MYA and 147 (111-184) MYA, respectively. Appendicosporaceae (Amphisphaeriales) has a stem age of 89 (65-117) MYA. Ancestral character state reconstruction indicates that astromatic, clypeate ascomata with aseptate, hyaline ascospores that lack germ slits may probably be ancestral Xylariomycetidae having plant-fungal endophytic associations. The Amphisphaeriales remained mostly astromatic with common septate, hyaline ascospores. Stromatic variations may have developed mostly during the Cretaceous period. Brown ascospores are common in Xylariales, but they first appeared in Amphisphaeriaceae, Melogrammataceae and Sporocadaceae during the early Cretaceous. The ascospore germ slits appeared only in Xylariales during the Cretaceous after the divergence of Lopadostomataceae. Hyaline, filiform and apiospores may have appeared as separate lineages, providing the basis for Xylariaceae, which may have diverged independently. The future classification of polyphyletic xylarialean taxa will not be based on stromatic variations, but the type of ring, the colour of the ascospores, and the presence or absence or the type of germ slit.

AB  - Simple Summary Whether a pig should be placed on its back or sternum to facilitate endotracheal intubation is currently not known and a subject of debate. Enrolling participants with different clinical anaesthesia backgrounds, we aimed at assessing which recumbency (dorsal versus sternal) is advantageous, and if operator experience can influence the results. Using objective and subjective outcomes, we found that sternal recumbency is advantageous if compared to dorsal, but that this is true only for operators lacking experience in anaesthetising animals. Experts' confidence in intubating various animal species with different techniques probably minimized the influence of recumbency. Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is challenging in pigs. We compared the number of attempts and time to perform ETI, and the subjective perception of ease, while the animal was positioned in dorsal (DR) or sternal (SR) recumbency, as well as assessed whether operator experience influences the outcome. Participants were divided into three groups: undergraduates (ST; veterinary students), graduates (GR; veterinarians without specific anaesthesia training) and experts (EX; veterinary anaesthesia intern/resident and diplomate of the European College of Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia). Each participant intubated one freshly euthanised pig in DR and ST. Number of attempts and time to correctly perform ETI, number of oesophageal intubations and answers to Likert-scale questions on larynx visualization and ease of endotracheal tube introduction and advancement were recorded. Thirty-three participants were enrolled (15 ST, 10 GR and 8 EX). Less attempts (p = 0.002) and time (p = 0.002) to correctly perform ETI were needed in SR for the ST group. In 21/119 and 5/48 ETI attempts, oesophageal intubation was performed in DR and SR, respectively. Larynx visualization (p < 0.001) and endotracheal tube introduction (p < 0.001) were perceived as easier in SR for the ST group. No difference between recumbencies was found in perceived ease to advance the endotracheal tube. For inexperienced operators, intubation in SR can be recommended.

AB  - IntroductionThe barrier function of the gut is important for many organs and systems, including the brain. If gut permeability increases, bacterial fragments may enter the circulation, giving rise to increased systemic inflammation. Increases in bacterial translocation are reflected in higher values of blood markers, including lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and soluble cluster of differentiation 14 (sCD14). Some pioneer studies showed a negative association between bacterial translocation markers and brain volumes, but this association remains scarcely investigated. We investigate the effect of bacterial translocation on brain volumes and cognition in both healthy controls and patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD). Materials and methodsHealthy controls (n = 39) and SSD patients (n = 72) underwent an MRI-scan, venipuncture and cognition assessments. We investigated associations between LBP and sCD14 and brain volumes (intracranial volume, total brain volume, and hippocampal volume) using linear regression. We then associated LBP and sCD14 to cognitive function using a mediation analysis, with intracranial volume as mediator. ResultsHealthy controls showed a negative association between hippocampal volume and LBP (b = -0.11, p = .04), and intracranial volume and sCD14 (b = -0.25, p = .07). Both markers were indirectly associated with lower cognitive functioning in healthy controls (LBP: b = -0.071, p = .028; sCD14: b = -0.213, p = .052), mediated by low intracranial volume. In the SSD patients, these associations were markedly less present. ConclusionThese findings extend earlier studies suggesting that increased bacterial translocation may negatively affect brain volume, which indirectly impacts cognition, even in this young healthy group. If replicated, this finding stresses the importance of a healthy gut for the development and optimal functioning of the brain. Absence of these associations in the SSD group may indicate that other factors such as allostatic load, chronic medication use and interrupted educational carrier had larger impact and attenuated the relative contribution of bacterial translocation.

AB  - Introduction Adversities during the perinatal period can decrease oxygen supply to the fetal brain, leading to various hypoxic brain injuries, which can compromise the regularity of brain development in different aspects. To examine the catecholaminergic contribution to the link between an early-life hypoxic insult and adolescent behavioral aberrations, we used a previously established rat model of perinatal hypoxia but altered the hypobaric to normobaric conditions.Methods Exploratory and social behavior and learning abilities were tested in 70 rats of both sexes at adolescent age. Inherent vertical locomotion, sensory-motor functions and spatial learning abilities were explored in a subset of animals to clarify the background of altered exploratory behavior. Finally, the concentrations of dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline in midbrain and pons, and the relative expression of genes for DA receptors D1 and D2, and their down-stream targets (DA- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr 32 kDa, the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A, and inhibitor-5 of protein phosphatase 1) in the hippocampus and thalamus were investigated in 31 rats.Results A lesser extent of alterations in exploratory and cognitive aspects of behavior in the present study suggests that normobaric conditions mitigate the hypoxic injury compared to the one obtained under hypobaric conditions. Increased exploratory rearing was the most prominent consequence, with impaired spatial learning in the background. In affected rats, increased midbrain/pons DA content, as well as mRNA levels for DA receptors and their down-stream elements in the thalamus, but not the hippocampus, were found.Conclusion We can conclude that a mild hypoxic event induced long-lasting disbalances in mesothalamic DA signaling, contributing to the observed behavioral alterations. The thalamus was thereby indicated as another structure, besides the well-established striatum, involved in mediating hypoxic effects on behavior through DA signaling.

AB  - Translocation of elephants is used to mitigate human-elephant conflict in Asia and Africa. However, few studies investigate how translocations affect the movements and social behaviour of individuals following their release, which may have important implications for whether translocated animals survive and succeed. Using GPS-tracking data, we explored movements of five translocated bull elephants (Loxodonta africana) moved to Tsavo, Kenya, and compared them with five resident bull elephants. Position data was collected hourly for 1 year (March 2018-March 2019), and analysed to investigate home range, displacement rates, problematic behaviour and group size. Of the five translocated elephants, three were illegally killed and one continued to break fences and raid crops. Only one elephant stayed away from human settlement. We found group size and composition to be significantly different, with translocated elephants observed in smaller groups with no female elephant interactions. All elephants showed variation in home ranges and displacement rates, but differences were not significant between resident and translocated elephant groups. For future translocations, we recommend careful consideration of elephant social systems, elephant age, timing, release site and proximity to human settlements that might create human-elephant conflict. This will improve chance for success of such high-stake and expensive translocations.

AB  - Simple Summary Animals have always lived with humans, but their presence in cities is growing. This phenomenon warrants a specific reflection on the advantages of human-animal interactions as a potential nature-based solution (solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which provide environmental, social, and economic benefits). This article aims to provide an overview of the current situation of animals in cities and to explore the roles of animals and their interactions with humans in such a context. Through the lens of the European project IN-HABIT in Lucca (Italy) (which aims to codify an integrated policy on the relationship between people and animals that will then be transferred and replicated in other cities), we investigated all these aspects. In addition, our work suggests the need for the involvement of different stakeholders in the implementation of actions that aim to valorize human-animal relationships and their positive effects.Abstract In recent decades, nature-based solutions (NBSs) have spread in scientific research, and they are increasingly deployed in cities' strategic planning. While the number of nonhuman animals in cities is growing, a specific reflection on the advantages of human-animal interactions as potential NBSs is still lacking. This article aims to provide an overview of the current situation of animals in cities and to explore the roles of animals and their interactions with humans in such a context. These topics are crucial to the European project IN-HABIT in Lucca (Italy), which aims to codify an integrated policy on the relationship between people and animals; its outputs will then be transferred and replicated in other cities. This article concludes by highlighting the need for the involvement of different stakeholders in public-private-people partnerships to implement actions that aim to valorize human-animal relationships and their positive effects. This study presents a perspective on the relevance of animal NBSs to increase the quality of life in cities, both for citizens and for animals living in cities, and to also introduce the opportunity to develop an integrated animal urban policy able to valorize human-animal interactions in cities.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), such as naringin (NG), Eucommiol, isopsoralen, icariin, Astragalus polysaccharides, and chondroitin sulfate, contained in Drynariae Rhizoma, Eucommiae Cortex, Psoralea corylifolia, Herba Epimedii, Astragalus radix and deer antler, are considered promising candidates for enhancing the healing of osteoporotic defects due to their outstanding bone homeostasis regulating properties. They are commonly used to activate bone repair scaffolds. Aim of the review: Bone repair scaffolds are inadequate to meet the demands of osteoporotic defect healing due to the lack of regulation of bone homeostasis. Therefore, selecting bone scaffolds activated with TCM to improve the therapeutic effect of repairing osteoporotic bone defects. Materials and methods: To gather information on bone scaffold activated by traditional Chinese medicine, we conducted a thorough search of several scientific databases, including Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scifinder, Baidu Scholar, PubMed, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Results: This review discusses the mechanism of TCM active ingredients in regulating bone homeostasis, including stimulating bone formation and inhibiting bone resorption process and the healing mechanism of traditional bone repair scaffolds activated by them for osteoporotic defect healing. Conclusion: In general, the introduction of TCM active ingredients provides a novel therapeutic approach for modulating bone homeostasis and facilitating osteoporotic defect healing, and also offers a new strategy for design of other unconventional bone defect healing materials.

AB  - Research on the welfare of pet guinea pigs and connections between their behaviour and husbandry practices is scarce. Through an online survey among 1181 German-speaking guinea pig caretakers, we investigated husbandry practices (including social composition, housing type, free roaming, enrichment, and feeding), human-animal interactions, and guinea pig behaviour. Most participating caretakers seemed attentive to their animals' needs and welfare, as shown by the prevalence of self-built enclosures (42.8%) and fenced floor areas (21.1%), with various enrichment and furnishings, and mostly balanced nutrition. Husbandry practices that can negatively impact welfare, such as individual housing and no constant access to hay, were observed for 7.5% and 0.4% of the animals, respectively. Eating and resting next to conspecifics and locomotor play occurred several times per day in 87.6%, 48.1%, and 19.9% of animals, respectively. Biting, running up and down and bar chewing were rare (several times per day in 0.4%, 2.9%, and 0.7% of animals, respectively). We found significant associations of guinea pig behaviour with human-animal interactions and housing conditions. For instance, affiliative behaviour and locomotor play and use of enrichment were more frequently reported in the case of more frequent positive human-animal interactions and food enrichment. Our results provide additional knowledge to support consultations on behaviour and husbandry practices.

AB  - The detection method of Camellia oleifera fruits is not only an essential part of the Camellia oleifera fruit detection and locating process, but also a key foundation of the vision robot harvesting. Due to the occlusions of branches and leaves, as well as the overlap of fruits, it is a daunting task to improve the precision of Camellia oleifera fruit detection in a natural environment. In this paper, we propose a YOLO-COF lightweight multiclass occlusion target detection method for Camellia oleifera fruit, introducing K-means++ clustering algorithm under the framework of YOLOv5s to automatically filter and select the target dataset; incorporating Coordinate Attention to enhance the feature extraction ability of occluded target and improve the generalizability and robustness of the model. The study assesses four categories of datasets: complete fruit occlusion NO, fruit occluded by leaf OL, fruit occluded by branches OB, and fruit occluded by other fruits OF, combining the new detection model and comparing with five Faster R-CNN, YOLOv4-MobileNetV3, YOLOv4-CSPDarknet, YOLOv5s, and YOLOv5x models. The experimental results indicate that the AP values of YOLO-COF for the detection of NO, OL, OB, and OF are 0.97, 0.94, 0.93, and 0.92, respectively. In comparison to other neural network models, YOLO-COF is well-balanced in terms of precision, speed, and size. Its mAP value is 94.10%, its frame rate is 74.8FPS, and its model size is 27.1 MB. The proposed model has the potential to facilitate the operational decision-making of vision robot during the process of Camellia oleifera fruit harvesting.

AB  - IntroductionTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is a public health concern with limited treatment options because it causes a cascade of side effects that are the leading cause of hospital death. Thioredoxin is an enzyme with neuroprotective properties such as antioxidant, antiapoptotic, immune response modulator, and neurogenic, among others; it has been considered a therapeutic target for treating many disorders. MethodsThe controlled cortical impact (CCI) model was used to assess the effect of recombinant human thioredoxin 1 (rhTrx1) (1 mu g/2 mu L, intracortical) on rats subjected to TBI at two different times of the light-dark cycle (01:00 and 13:00 h). We analyzed the food intake, body weight loss, motor coordination, pain perception, and histology in specific hippocampus (CA1, CA2, CA3, and Dental Gyrus) and striatum (caudate-putamen) areas. ResultsBody weight loss, reduced food intake, spontaneous pain, motor impairment, and neuronal damage in specific hippocampus and striatum regions are more evident in rats subjected to TBI in the light phase than in the dark phase of the cycle and in groups that did not receive rhTrx1 or minocycline (as positive control). Three days after TBI, there is a recovery in body weight, food intake, motor impairment, and pain, which is more pronounced in the rats subjected to TBI at the dark phase of the cycle and those that received rhTrx1 or minocycline. ConclusionsKnowing the time of day a TBI occurs in connection to the neuroprotective mechanisms of the immune response in diurnal variation and the usage of the Trx1 protein might have a beneficial therapeutic impact in promoting quick recovery after a TBI.

AB  - The late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) witnessed the intensification of climatic gradients with the onset of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age. During this time, high latitudes were characterized by the spread of ice sheets, whereas the palaeotropics hosted the emergence of vast, verdant, coal-forming, swamp forests. Not only were the planet's landscapes transformed through proliferation and diversification of vascular plants, but the evolution of diverse insect groups, including 'primitive' roachoids, reconfigured the terrestrial fauna. Here, we re-examine and describe new roachoid taxa from Moscovian strata of the Benxi Formation. The studied insect material was sourced from early 20th century collections held in the Swedish Museum of Natural History and the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, and is co-preserved with a broad array of plant fossils-some with evidence of herbivory damage. Our findings introduce Tangshanblatta inexpectata gen. et sp. nov. (Phyloblattidae), Pseudaphtoromylacris paucinervis gen. et sp. nov. (in the family Pseudaphtoromylacridae, fam. nov.), Spilarchimylacris kaipingense sp. nov. (Archimylacridae), and Etomylacris straeleni sp. nov. and Sooblattella ater sp. nov. (both Mylacridae). We establish Pseudaphtoromylacridae on the basis of several new characters that clearly differentiate it from related families. Etomylacris is restored from synonymy with Mylacris. The co-preserved plant fossils reveal a rich palaeovegetation including pteridophytes, 'pteridosperms', sphenophytes, conifers, and arborescent lycophytes. The remains of these plants bear seven distinct damage types belonging to four functional feeding groups: hole feeding, margin feeding, piercing and sucking, and oviposition. This diversity of insects, plants, and herbivory strategies signifies a relatively complex food web in the Carboniferous tropical coal-forming forests of northeast China. This study also demonstrates the value of historical museum collections and the importance of inter-institutional collaboration for piecing together palaeobiodiversity and palaeoecological information from now inaccessible fossil sites.

AB  - The livestock sector plays an essential role in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, where fodder crop production has been largely identified as the main contributor to their environmental impact. This research evaluates the attributional environmental impacts of introducing food industry subproducts such as apple and olive pomaces to reduce the proportion of maize grain in the formulation of diets for fattening pigs, according to four alternatives, including the current diet with 69% maize. For this, the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology has been used to determine the hotspots associated to these changes, considering a cradle-to-gate approach and two functional units: 1 kg of feed diet (FU1) and 1 kg of weight gain (FU2). Furthermore, the potential environmental consequences of using these subproducts for pig diet have also been considered with a consequential LCA methodology. The results show that the best diet was the one containing about 33% maize and 43% subproducts for all categories analysed. In addition, the allocation method used to assign subproduct loads, including mass, economic, and zeroburdens allocation, is crucial to validate the assumptions and recommendations for this strategy. The consequential LCA results suggest that this strategy could involve both positive and negative impacts (considered as environmental credits), depending on the substitutes for the avoided maize stover and the potential displaced bioproducts that could be obtained from these subproducts, mainly for bioenergy production.

AB  - Alkaline stress is a major concern in aquaculture that badly affects the aquatic species' health and hemostasis. This research investigated the effect of carbonate alkalinity exposure on the gills and kidney organs as important organs for hemostasis, as well as the ameliorative role of camel protein hydrolysates (CPH) as dietary additives against alkaline stress detrimental impacts in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The fish (n = 160) were divided into four groups (G1, G2, G3, and G4), with the control (G1) fed a basal diet, while G2 was fed a basal diet supplemented with 75 g CPH/kg and was reared in freshwater (carbonate alkalinity of 1.4 mu mol/L, pH = 7.19). The G3 and G4 were reared in alkaline water (carbonate alkalinity of 23.8 mu mol/L, pH = 8.65) and fed the same diets as G1 and G2 for 30 days, respectively. The fish were stocked under a water temperature of 26.4 +/- 1.5 degrees C, and the diets were introduced to the fish three times daily at a rate of 4% of their body weight. The results of this research showed that alkaline exposure increased kidney function parameters (creatinine, urea, and uric acid), glucose, and cortisol levels in the exposed fish. Alkaline exposure reduced the blood electrolytes level (calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and chloride) and branchial antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and reduced glutathione) and elevated malondialdehyde level in the exposed fish. Significant downregulation of the branchial expression of Na+/K+ ATPase alpha-3 subunit (0.17-fold), calcium/calmodulin-dependant protein kinase 1 beta (0.23 fold), chloride channel protein 2 (0.38-fold), solute carrier family 12 a 2 (0.33-fold), and solute carrier family 4 a 4 (0.21-fold) was in the fish-reared under carbonate alkalinity stress. Alkaline exposure induced severe histopathological changes in the gills and kidney tissue architecture including inflammatory, circulatory, degenerative, and progressive responses. Supplementation of the Nile tilapia diet with 75 g CPH/kg ameliorated renal function and balanced the blood electrolytes, glucose, and cortisol levels in the alkaline-exposed fish. Modulation of the branchial gene expression profile and improving the gills and kidney microstructure were consequences of feeding on CPH diets during alkaline stress situations. Overall, fortifying the Nile tilapia diets with 75 g CPH/kg helps the fish restore their hemostasis and metabolic status during alkaline stress exposure which enables the sustainable culture of this species in such conditions.

AB  - PurposeMRI-based whole-brain manual segmentation methods are considered the gold standard for brain volumetric analysis, but are time-consuming and prone to human error. Automated segmentation tools like FreeSurfer can identify differences in brain volumes between healthy and non-healthy individuals. Deep-learning-based segmentation tools, such as FastSurfer, offer faster processing times, but further validation is needed, particularly in pediatric cases. This study aims to compare FastSurfer with FreeSurfer in a pediatric cohort and compare the volume estimates with previously published reference values.MethodsA multicenter cohort of 448 subjects aged 4-18 years from three centers was used to compare FastSurfer with FreeSurfer. Validation metrics, including the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), relative volume differences (RVD), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), were computed. Hemispheric asymmetries were assessed by calculating a hemispheric asymmetry index.FindingsThe segmentation methods demonstrated high agreement, with a mean DSC across subjects and regions of interest of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.79; 0.95), RVD of 0.3% (95% CI: -7.6%; 7.4%), and ICC of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.52; 0.94). After a visual inspection, which led to the exclusion of 12 subjects with segmentation errors, growth charts for relative volume estimates of 15 anatomical brain regions were generated, revealing varying growth patterns across ages. A potential clinical application is illustrated by plotting a patient's data on these growth charts, showing a specific atrophy pattern.ConclusionTo our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the use of FastSurfer in volumetric analysis of a pediatric population. Our findings suggest that FastSurfer is a reliable segmentation tool for pediatric data and is particularly promising for clinical practice due to its high accuracy despite rapid processing times. The morphometric data, growth charts, and code are publicly accessible.

AB  - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has pointed out the high vulnerability of developing countries to climate change, which is expected to impact food and income security. Sheep farming is one of the main animal productions among the families located in the most vulnerable regions of the semiarid region of Pernambuco state, a Brazilian territory known for its high temperatures, low relative humidity, and high net solar radiation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify different regions of Pernambuco that may be more suitable for different breeds of sheep, based on non-parametric statistics and kriging maps of the temperature and humidity index (THI). THI values were determined based on mean annual temperature and wind speed extracted from the TerraClimate remote sensing database. Pernambuco state presented THI values ranging from 66 to 79, with the hair breeds having a high potential for exploitation in almost all territories, including the main meat-producing breeds. The East Friesian breed, a high milk producer, would be well suited to the Agreste mesoregion, a territory that, like the Pajeu and Moxoto microregions, also proved favorable for the introduction of three wool breeds (Suffolk, Poll Dorset, and Texel) known as major meat producers. The kriging maps of the THI values successfully allowed the identification of strategic development regions of Pernambuco state with high potential for sheep breeding.

AB  - Total number born (TNB), number of stillborn (NSB), and gestation length (GL) are economically important traits in pig production, and disentangling the molecular mechanisms associated with traits can provide valuable insights into their genetic structure. Genotype imputation can be used as a practical tool to improve the marker density of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips based on sequence data, thereby dramatically improving the power of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In this study, we applied Beagle software to impute the 50 K chip data to the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data with average imputation accuracy (R-2) of 0.876. The target pigs, 2655 Large White pigs introduced from Canadian and French lines, were genotyped by a GeneSeek Porcine 50K chip. The 30 Large White reference pigs were the key ancestral individuals sequenced by whole-genome resequencing. To avoid population stratification, we identified genetic variants associated with reproductive traits by performing within-population GWAS and cross-population meta-analyses with data before and after imputation. Finally, several genes were detected and regarded as potential candidate genes for each of the traits: for the TNB trait: NOTCH2, KLF3, PLXDC2, NDUFV1, TLR10, CDC14A, EPC2, ORC4, ACVR2A, and GSC; for the NSB trait: NUB1, TGFBR3, ZDHHC14, FGF14, BAIAP2L1, EVI5, TAF1B, and BCAR3; for the GL trait: PPP2R2B, AMBP, MALRD1, HOXA11, and BICC1. In conclusion, expanding the size of the reference population and finding an optimal imputation strategy to ensure that more loci are obtained for GWAS under high imputation accuracy will contribute to the identification of causal mutations in pig breeding.

AB  - Premise Extrafloral nectaries have mainly been studied in angiosperms, but have also been reported in 39 fern species. Here we provide a global review of nectaries in ferns and examined their structure, function, and nectar sugar composition in two genera. Methods We searched in the literature and living plant collections of botanical gardens for indications of fern nectaries, observed nectar-feeding animals, studied the morphoanatomy in the two genera Aglaomorpha and Campyloneurum, and analyzed the total sugar concentrations and ratios of 16 species. Diurnal nectar release was observed with time-lapse photography. Results We found evidence for nectaries in 101 species of ferns from 11 genera and 6 families. Most of the nectary-bearing species were tree ferns (Cyatheaceae) and epiphytic ferns of the family Polypodiaceae. Nectaries consisted of cytoplasm-rich parenchyma with large nuclei and an epidermis with or without stomata, were attached to amphiphloic vascular bundles, and released nectar on the lower leaf surface mainly on expanding leaves during the night. Sugar concentrations varied between species (3.8-15.3%) but not between genera, and were sucrose-dominant (3 spp.), sucrose-rich (7), or hexose-rich (3). In the greenhouse, introduced ants, scale insects, and snails fed on the nectar. Conclusions The wide taxonomic distribution, variable morphology, locations, and sugar compositions point to multiple evolutionary origins of fern nectaries. Nectar release in young leaves might attract mutualistic ants to protect leaves against herbivores only during this most vulnerable developmental stage. Even ex-situ, fern nectar is a valuable food source because it attracted several opportunistic animal species.

AB  - Intraspecific variation in animal mating systems can have important implications for ecological, evolutionary and demographic processes in wild populations. For example, patterns of mating can impact social structure, dispersal, effective population size and inbreeding. However, few species have been studied in sufficient detail to elucidate mating system plasticity and its dependence on ecological and demographic factors. Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) have long been regarded as a textbook example of a polygynous mating system, with dominant 'beachmaster' males controlling harems of up to several hundred females. However, behavioural and genetic studies have uncovered appreciable geographic variation in the strength of polygyny among elephant seal populations. We, therefore, used molecular parentage analysis to investigate patterns of parentage in a small satellite colony of elephant seals at the South Shetland Islands. We hypothesised that dominant males would be able to successfully monopolise the relatively small numbers of females present in the colony, leading to relatively high levels of polygyny. A total of 424 individuals (comprising 33 adult males, 101 adult females and 290 pups) sampled over 8 years were genotyped at 20 microsatellites and reproductive success was analysed by genetically assigning parents. Paternity could only be assigned to 31 pups (10.7%), despite our panel of genetic markers being highly informative and the genotyping error rate being very low. The strength of inferred polygyny was weak in comparison to previous genetic studies of the same species, with the most successful male fathering only seven pups over the entire course of our study. Our results show that, even in a species long regarded as a model for extreme polygyny, male reproductive skew can vary substantially among populations.

AB  - Premise Exploring how functional traits vary and covary is important to understand plant responses to environmental change. However, we have limited understanding of the ways multiple functional traits vary and covary within invasive species. Methods We measured 12 leaf traits of an invasive plant Chromolaena odorata, associated with plant or leaf economics, herbivore defense, and drought resistance on 10 introduced populations from Asia and 12 native populations from South and Central America, selected across a broad range of climatic conditions, and grown in a common garden. Results Species' range and climatic conditions influenced leaf traits, but trait variation across climate space differed between the introduced and native ranges. Traits that confer defense against herbivores and drought resistance were associated with economic strategy, but the patterns differed by range. Plants from introduced populations that were at the fast-return end of the spectrum (high photosynthetic capacity) had high physical defense traits (high trichome density), whereas plants from native populations that were at the fast-return end of the spectrum had high drought escape traits (early leaf senescence and high percentage of withered shoots). Conclusions Our results indicate that invasive plants can rapidly adapt to novel environmental conditions. Chromolaena odorata showed multiple different functional trait covariation patterns and clines in the native and introduced ranges. Our results emphasize that interaction between multiple traits or functions should be considered when investigating the adaptive evolution of invasive plants.

AB  - Background Hypertension is a well-established risk factor for cognitive impairment, brain atrophy, and dementia. However, the relationship of other types of hypertensions, such as isolated hypertension on brain health and its comparison to systolic-diastolic hypertension (where systolic and diastolic measures are high), is still relatively unknown. Due to its increased prevalence, it is important to investigate the impact of isolated hypertension to help understand its potential impact on cognitive decline and future dementia risk. In this study, we compared a variety of global brain measures between participants with isolated hypertension to those with normal blood pressure (BP) or systolic-diastolic hypertension using the largest cohort of healthy individuals. Methods Using the UK Biobank cohort, we carried out a cross-sectional study using 29,775 participants (mean age 63 years, 53% female) with BP measurements and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We used linear regression models adjusted for multiple confounders to compare a variety of global, subcortical, and white matter brain measures. We compared participants with either isolated systolic or diastolic hypertension with normotensives and then with participants with systolic-diastolic hypertension. Results The results showed that participants with isolated systolic or diastolic hypertension taking BP medications had smaller gray matter but larger white matter microstructures and macrostructures compared to normotensives. Isolated systolic hypertensives had larger total gray matter and smaller white matter traits when comparing these regions with participants with systolic-diastolic hypertension. Conclusions These results provide support to investigate possible preventative strategies that target isolated hypertension as well as systolic-diastolic hypertension to maintain brain health and/or reduce dementia risk earlier in life particularly in white matter regions.

AB  - As scientists involved in identifying and helping to implement actions to conserve declining populations of threatened species, we are concerned at the mismatch between the speed and extent of many currently observed declines and the fitness-for-purpose and scale of implementation of conservation programmes. Accurate and rapid diagnosis of the external causes of declines should be an important component of most species conservation programmes. We propose a stepwise framework to ensure that this can be done in a timely way. Central to our proposals is the recognition that seeking a perfect diagnosis can foreclose options for successful remedial action in a rapidly accelerating conservation crisis. We therefore outline approaches that may be used when detailed data are lacking or sparse. Solution. Expand the use of the diagnostic processes we describe to identify and test effective actions to halt and reverse species' population declines.

AB  - Increasing pig productivity and maintaining animal health without the use of antibiotics and other growth stimulants are key challenges in modern pig farming. In addition to the long-standing ban on the use of antibiotics in livestock farming, in 2022, the EU also introduced a ban on the use of zinc oxide in piglet feeding due to the environmental contamination risks. In order to overcome the food deficit and improve the overall productivity of the industry, selective breeding is being carried out in pig farming to enhance the litter size of sows. However, this often leads to the birth of a large number of small piglets that require special care to ensure adequate nutrition to support their growth and development. One such approach is the use of functional amino acids in animal feeding, as recent studies have shown the impact of amino acids on metabolism and the body as a whole, their utilization, exchange, and application to improve productivity, health, and animal well-being. The correct selection and use of functional amino acids in pig feeding can contribute not only to increased productivity but also to improved product quality and reproductive performance. The aim of this review was to summarize data from the last 10-15 years regarding the use of functional amino acids in the feeding of pigs from various groups. An analysis of the literature showed that the use of functional amino acids in pig feeding can enhance their productivity and serve as an alternative to banned substances, especially during critical periods of life, as well as for stimulating growth and productivity in animals.

AB  - Multiple introductions of tea (Camellia sinensis) to the United States since the 1850s have resulted in US tea germplasm that are currently poorly characterized. To resolve questions concerning the relatedness and regional adaptability of US tea germplasm, 32 domestic individuals were evaluated using 10 InDel markers, and compared with a background population of 30 named and registered Chinese varieties of tea. The marker data were analyzed via a neighbor-joining cladistic tree derived from Nei's genetic distance, STRUCTURE, and Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components, which revealed four genetic groups. Nineteen individuals selected from the four groups were assessed for seven leaf traits, two floral descriptors, and leaf yield, to identify plants best adapted to Florida field conditions. Our analyses compared with available historical records led us to estimate the most likely provenance of some of the US individuals, to precisely identify tea plant material and to choose most diverse accessions for breeding tea improved for adaptability, yield and quality.

AB  - Classical biological control aims to suppress alien invasive plant populations by introducing host-specific natural enemies from the native range. This relies on the assumption that invasive plant populations in the invaded range benefit from the release of natural enemies. Pre-release surveys in the invaded range are a useful way to determine if enemy release applies to a particular invasive alien plant, and to determine what other factors may contribute to the invasion. Similarly, pre-release surveys gather information that can be used to compare invaded sites before and after the release of biological control agents and may also identify whether natural enemies have been accidentally introduced into the country. Pre-release surveys were conducted in South Africa on the invasive Nymphaea mexicana Zuccarini (Nymphaeaceae) to gather such information about this species, for which a biological control programme is being developed. There was lower diversity and abundance of herbivores in the native range compared to South Africa, suggesting that N. mexicana does experience enemy release at most sites in South Africa. This support for the enemy release hypothesis justifies the investment in biological control for its management. However, a native weevil, Bagous longulus Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), was found feeding and reproducing on N. mexicana at three sites, resulting in damage to the leaves and suggesting that a novel association has formed between these species. Bagous longulus may have potential to be distributed to sites of N. mexicana where it is not present, though further investigation is necessary to confirm if its host range is suitable for this to be a safe endeavour. With the exception of sites where B. longulus was present, leaf sizes were large and damage was low, and there is no evidence that any natural enemies have been accidentally introduced from the native range. Findings such as these emphasise the importance of conducting thorough surveys during the development of biological control programmes.

AB  - The sodium smelting of vanadium-titanium magnetite (VTM) can realize a multi-component comprehensive utilization of VTM. To broaden the application of the vanadium-bearing pig iron produced through this process, it is imperative to maintain the titanium content in molten iron at a very low level. In this study, the effects of temperature, the added amounts of sodium carbonate and anthracite, and the smelting time on the titanium content of molten iron were investigated using thermodynamic calculations and experiments. The results indicate that the introduction of sodium carbonate makes the reduction reaction of VTM a relatively low-temperature smelting system. In the smelting process, the Ti content in molten iron increases with the increase in temperature and decreases with the addition of sodium carbonate, while the amount of anthracite added has little effect on it. The appropriate technological parameters were determined as temperature: 1150-1250 degrees C, smelting time: >= 2 h, anthracite consumption: 25-35%, and sodium carbonate consumption: >= 60%. In addition, it was determined that the Ti impurities in the V-bearing pig iron were mainly (Ti,V)(C,N), CaTiO3, and Na2TiO3. All results obtained from this work contribute to the comprehensive utilization of VTM, and also provide theoretical support for the sodium smelting of VTM.

AB  - Introduction Agarwood, a prized aromatic resin from Aquilaria sinensis, is formed as a defensive response to injury or fungal infection. However, the factors influencing its chemical composition remain poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the relationship between endophytic fungal communities and volatile oil content in ordinary-type and Qinan-type A. sinensis. Methods Using high-throughput sequencing, we analyzed the fungal composition in both the healthy wood and agarwood layers of different A. sinensis germplasms. Additionally, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed to quantify the volatile oil content. Results The results revealed that the fungal community composition in the agarwood layer differed between the two types of A. sinensis, with Fusarium, Hermatomyces, and Rhinocladiella linked to sesquiterpene production (r>0.8, p<0.01), while Microidium, Cladosporium, and Cephalotrichum were associated with chromone levels (r>0.8, p<0.01). Furthermore, the volatile oil content in Qinan-type agarwood was significantly higher than that in ordinary-type agarwood, with distinct chemical profiles observed in each germplasm. Discussion These findings provide critical insights into the role of endophytic fungi in shaping agarwood's chemical composition and have practical implications for enhancing agarwood production in the industry. Consequently, this research has significant implications for the agarwood industry, as it enhances our understanding of how fungi influence resin quality and paves the way for improving the efficiency of agarwood induction, ultimately leading to higher-quality and more sustainable production.

AB  - The nasal septal island (NSI) is a sensory patch of neuroepithelium located within the soft tissue of the nasal septum in dromedaries. The island has unique anatomical features, including the specialized subepithelial glands. The aim of the present study was to describe the microscopic features and ultrastructure of these subepithelial glands and to speculate the possible functions. A total of 10 camel heads were used for the study. Unlike the serous and mucous airway glands, the NSI glands' ultrastructural features were typical for cells of the (Amine Precursor Uptake and Decarboxylation, APUD) system. These features were included, membrane bound secretory vesicles of varying electron density, smooth endoplasmic reticulum in the form of vesicles; electron dense mitochondria, abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and free ribosomes. Alcian-PAS identifiable mucus granules were not observed, except for few clusters of cells, located at the luminal surface. The probable functions were discussed on basis of cellular morphology and context. In a conclusion, the NSI subepithelial glands in dromedaries had unique anatomical structures, and as many other APUD cells, they had the machinery required for synthesis of a variable number of biologically active peptides, amines and chemical mediators.

AB  - Introduction: Object-location memory (OLM) is essential for remembering the locations of objects within an environment and is often impaired in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown promise for improving OLM, although study outcomes have varied considerably. This study aimed to identify key brain regions involved in OLM that may serve as stimulation targets for future tDCS research and to assess the test-retest reliability (TRR) of both behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Methods: Twenty healthy young adults (10 females; mean age = 25.0 years, standard deviation [SD] = 5.56) completed two task-based fMRI sessions using parallel versions of an OLM task. Participants learned associations between house images and their locations on a two-dimensional street map across four feedback-based learning stages. Sham tDCS was administered in both sessions using a focal 3 x 1 electrode montage. TRR was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for behavioral performance and task-related fMRI activation. Results: Behavioral data showed significant improvements in response accuracy (estimate = 0.211, p < 0.001) and a reduction in response latency (estimate = -0.050, p < 0.001) across learning stages. fMRI analysis revealed predominantly right-lateralized activation, including the right hippocampus, the fusiform gyrus, the precuneus, and the lateral temporo-occipital areas. Behavioral measures showed moderate to good TRR (accuracy ICC = 0.801; reaction time ICC = 0.705). Task-related fMRI activity demonstrated good-to-excellent TRR in key regions, including the fusiform and temporo-occipital cortices. Conclusion: These findings support the validity of our OLM paradigm for assessing brain stimulation effects and highlight potential cortical targets for future tDCS interventions. The observed reliability of behavioral and neural measures further reinforces the utility of this protocol in crossover study designs.

AB  - In the present study, extract (E) and bio-ferment (B) were obtained from ground and defatted thistle seeds of Silybum marianum. Their antioxidant activity was assessed using the DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP techniques, while total polyphenols were measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. High antioxidant activity was found in both the E (0.91 mmol Trolox/L +/- 0.2) and B (1.19 mmol Trolox/L +/- 0.2) using DPPH methods, so the obtained cosmetic raw materials were incorporated into hydrogel and organogel substrates to obtain cosmetic formulations with antioxidant activity. However, there is a scarcity of research providing information on the skin penetration of the main active components of S. marianum, which have an antioxidant effect. Therefore, we assessed in vitro the penetration through pig skin of the main components contained in the obtained B and E, such as silybin and taxifolin, which are part of the silymarin complex. We also used pure silymarin (S) for comparison. Among the tested preparations, H-S showed the utmost significant penetration of taxifolin, having a cumulative permeation of 87.739 +/- 7.457 mu g/cm(2). Biodegradation tests of the prepared formulations were also performed, containing cosmetic raw materials and S. Studies of the effect of the cosmetic formulations on aerobic biodegradation showed a good level of degradation for the prepared formulations, some of which (O-B and O-S) were classified as easily degradable (OECD).

AB  - Endophytic feeding behaviors, including stem borings and galling, have been observed in the fossil record from as early as the Devonian and involve the consumption of a variety of plant (and fungal) tissues. Historically, the exploitation of internal stem tissues through galling has been well documented as emerging during the Pennsylvanian (c. 323-299 million years ago (Ma)), replaced during the Permian by galling of foliar tissues. However, leaf mining, a foliar endophytic behavior that today is exhibited exclusively by members of the four hyperdiverse holometabolous insect orders, has been more sparsely documented, with confirmed examples dating back only to the Early Triassic (c. 252-250 Ma).Here, we describe a trace fossil on seed-fern foliage from the Rhode Island Formation of Massachusetts, USA, representing the earliest indication of a general, endophytic type of feeding damage and dating from the Middle Pennsylvanian (c. 312 Ma).Although lacking the full features of Mesozoic leaf mines, this specimen provides evidence of how endophytic mining behavior may have originated.It sheds light on the evolutionary transition to true foliar endophagy, contributes to our understanding of the behaviors of early holometabolous insects, and enhances our knowledge of macroevolutionary patterns of plant-insect interactions.

AB  - Introduction: Cadmium (Cd) has been recognized as a significant contributor to the pollution of farmland soils in China, and biochars have been reported to be effective in mitigating soil Cd pollution. However, most studies have been conducted in laboratory or greenhouse settings, not at a field scale, and the biochars used have been applied at unrealistically high amounts (> 10 t/ha).Methods: In this research, three biochars: rice straw biochar (RSB), pig manure biochar (PMB) and rice husk biochar (RHB) were produced from readily available farm residues. Then the effects at low-level application (1.8 and 3.6 t/ha) on Cd were investigated in a field experiment cropped with rape (Brassica campestris L.).Results: Batch adsorption experiments indicated Cd adsorption capacity of three biochars followed the order of RSB (43.5 mg/g) > PMB (33.3 mg/g) > RHB (24.4 mg/g). Field experiment indicated biochar amendments could slightly change soil pH and cation exchange capacity (CEC); yet led to considerable and significant decreases in extractable Cd concentrations [reductions of: 43%-51% (PMB), 29%-35% (RSB) and 17%-19% (RHB)]. Reduced extractable Cd correlated with lower Cd concentrations in rape plants. PMB and RSB were more effective in decreasing Cd phytoaccumulation into edible parts of rape (> 68% reduction) than RHB.Discussion: Low-level application of PMB or RSB could efficiently decrease the phytoaccumulation of Cd from soils into crops. These results demonstrate the reality of biochar-based remediation solutions to contribute to the mitigation of diffuse Cd contamination in farmland. The results also highlight the need to trail biochars in the presence of the soil to be targeted for remediation.

AB  - The septal organs are islands or patches of sensory epithelium, located in the ventral parts of the nasal septum and innervated by the olfactory nerve. The septal island in dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius) was unusually located in the rostro-dorsal part of the nasal septum, where the ethmoidal branch of the trigeminal nerve provides innervation to the island mucosa. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to reveal the microscopic and ultrastructure of this island and to explain the probable functions. Twelve septal islands from 12 healthy male camels were used. Unlike the olfactory epithelium, which has a pseudostratified structure, the island neuroepithelium had a true neural lamination. Furthermore, in electron micrographs, the receptor, bipolar, and basal cells were connected with an orderly, organized network of cell-cell communication, which had some spine synapses. This network substituted the absence of supporting cells, maintained the shape of the tissue, and held the cells together. Moreover, the receptor cells were not similar to any of the different types of olfactory sensory neurons. Instead, they possessed the apical domain that might be specialized for the detection of chemical stimuli. Interestingly, a resident population of immune cells, namely mast cells and macrophages, was observed. The probable functions were discussed based on the cellular context and architecture. The nasal septal island in dromedaries may have a role in pain perception. The receptor cells most probably work as nociceptive cells that interact with the resident immune cells to coordinate pain signaling with immune response. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart disease affecting newborns and involves stenosis of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). Surgical correction often widens the RVOT with a transannular enlargement patch, but this causes issues including pulmonary valve insufficiency and progressive right ventricle failure. A monocusp valve can prevent pulmonary regurgitation; however, valve failure resulting from factors including leaflet design, morphology, and immune response can occur, ultimately resulting in pulmonary insufficiency. A multimodal platform to quantitatively evaluate the effect of shape, size, and material on clinical outcomes could optimize monocusp design. This study introduces a benchtop soft biorobotic heart model, a computational fluid model of the RVOT, and a monocusp valve made from an entirely biological cell-assembled extracellular matrix (CAM) to tackle the multifaceted issue of monocusp failure. The hydrodynamic and mechanical performance of RVOT repair strategies was assessed in biorobotic and computational platforms. The monocusp valve design was validated in vivo in ovine models through echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and catheterization. These models supported assessment of surgical feasibility, handling, suturability, and hemodynamic and mechanical monocusp capabilities. The CAM-based monocusp offered a competent pulmonary valve with regurgitation of 4.6 +/- 0.9% and a transvalvular pressure gradient of 4.3 +/- 1.4 millimeters of mercury after 7 days of implantation in sheep. The biorobotic heart model, in silico analysis, and in vivo RVOT modeling allowed iteration in monocusp design not now feasible in a clinical environment and will support future surgical testing of biomaterials for complex congenital heart malformations.

AB  - Introduction Tea-oil Camellia species play a crucial economic and ecological role worldwide, yet their mitochondrial genomes remain largely unexplored.Methods In this study, we assembled and analyzed the complete mitochondrial genomes of Camellia oleifera and C. meiocarpa, revealing multi-branch structures that deviate from the typical circular mitochondrial genome observed in most plants. The assembled mitogenomes span 953,690 bp (C. oleifera) and 923,117 bp (C. meiocarpa), containing 74 and 76 annotated mitochondrial genes, respectively.Results Comparative genomic analyses indicated that C. oleifera and C. meiocarpa share a closer genetic relationship, whereas C. drupifera is more distantly related. Codon usage analysis revealed that natural selection plays a dominant role in shaping codon bias in these mitochondrial genomes. Additionally, extensive gene transfer events were detected among the three species, highlighting the dynamic nature of mitochondrial genome evolution in Tea-oil Camellia. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on mitochondrial genes exhibited incongruence with chloroplast phylogenies, suggesting potential discordance due to hybridization events, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), or horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Furthermore, we identified species-specific mitochondrial markers, which provide valuable molecular tools for distinguishing Tea-oil Camellia species.Discussion Our findings enhance the understanding of mitochondrial genome evolution and genetic diversity in Tea-oil Camellia, offering essential genomic resources for phylogenetics, species identification, and evolutionary research in woody plants.

AB  - Introduction Aphids are phloem sap-sucking insects and are a serious destructive pest of several crop plants. Aphids are categorized as "generalists" or "specialists" depending on their host range. Myzus persicae (Sulz.) is a generalist aphid with a broad host range while Lipaphis erysimi (Kalt.), a specialist aphid, has a narrow host range. Aphid infestation involves several sequential stages including host recognition and selection, overcoming primary plant defence barriers, feeding on phloem sap and detoxification of host defence responses. Information on the molecular basis of variations between generalist and specialist aphids with reference to the above processes is limited.Methods In the current study, we generated transcriptome data of M. persicae and L. erysimi from adult and nymph stages and analysed the differential expression of genes between adults of the generalist and specialist aphid and similarly, between nymphs of the two aphid species. We categorized these differentially expressed genes into nine different categories namely, chemosensation-related, plant cell wall degrading enzymes, detoxification-related, digestive enzymes, peptidases, carbohydrate-, lipid-, amino acid-metabolism and reproduction. We also identified putative effector molecules in both M. persicae and L. erysimi from the transcriptome data,Results and discussion Gene expression analysis identified 7688 and 8194 differentially expressed unigenes at adult and nymph stages, respectively of M. persicae and L. erysimi. M. persicae showed significantly higher levels of expression in a greater number of unigenes (5112 in adults and 5880 in nymphs) in contrast to the specialist, L. erysimi (2576 in adults and 2314 in nymphs) in both developmental stages. In addition, M. persicae displayed a greater number (350 in adults and 331 in nymphs) of upregulated unigenes involved in important processes such as host recognition, plant cell wall degradation, detoxification, digestion and metabolism, which correlate with its dynamic and polyphagous nature in contrast to the specialist (337 in adults and 251 in nymphs). We also observed a greater number of putative effectors in M. persicae (948 in adults and 283 in nymphs) than L. erysimi (797 in adults and 245 in nymphs). Based on our analysis, we conclude that the generalist aphid, M. persicae has a more diversified and stronger arsenal of genes that influence its polyphagous feeding behaviour and effective response to plant defence mechanisms against insect-herbivory. Our study provides a compendium of such candidate genes that would be most useful in studies on aphid biology, evolution and control.

AB  - Simple Summary Data on hepatitis E virus (HEV) strains circulating in carnivores are still limited. However, serological evidence suggests that their exposure to HEV infection is more common than expected. In addition, close relatives of Orthohepevirus C detected in rats and in human patients with persistent hepatitis have been detected in ferrets, minks, and foxes, providing a rationale for investigating the presence of HEV or HEV-like viruses in wild carnivores. Herewith, we report the identification and the nearly full-genome (7212 nucleotides) characterization of an HEV Gt3 strain detected in a faecal specimen collected from a wolf found dead in Northwestern Italy. This finding poses questions concerning the potential role of wolves as HEV mechanical, passive carriers, favouring the introduction and spread of HEV in the environment. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is a major health problem worldwide. In developed countries, zoonotic transmission of HEV genotypes (Gt) 3 and 4 is caused by the ingestion of raw or undercooked meat of infected pigs and wild boars, the main reservoirs of HEV. However, additional animals may harbour HEV or HEV-related strains, including carnivores. In this study, we investigated the molecular epidemiology of orthohepeviruses in wild canids by screening a total of 136 archival faecal samples, collected from wolves (42) and red foxes (94) in Northwestern Italy. Orthohepevirus RNA was identified in a faecal specimen, collected from a wolf carcass in the province of La Spezia (Liguria Region, Italy). The nearly full-length (7212 nucleotides) genome of the strain HEV/81236/Wolf/2019/ITA (GenBank accession no. MZ463196) was determined by combining a sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) approach with the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing platform. Upon phylogenetic analysis, the HEV detected in wolf was segregated into clade HEV-3.1, displaying the highest nucleotide (nt) identity (89.0-93.3%) to Gt3 strains belonging to subtype c. Interestingly, the wolf faecal sample also contained porcine astrovirus sequences, endorsing the hypothesis of a dietary origin of the HEV strain due to preying habits.

AB  - Infection with bovine leukemia virus (BLV) leads to enzootic bovine leukosis, the most prevalent neoplastic disease in cattle. Due to the lack of commercially available vaccines, reliable eradication of the disease can be achieved through the testing and elimination of BLV antibody-positive animals. In this study, we developed a novel competitive ELISA (cELISA) to detect antibodies against BLV capsid protein p24. Recombinant p24 protein expressed by Escherichia coli, in combination with the monoclonal antibody 2G11 exhibiting exceptional performance, was used for the establishment of the cELISA. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 98.85 % and 98.13 %, respectively. Furthermore, the established cELISA was specific for detecting BLV-specific antibodies, without cross-reactivity to antisera for six other bovine viruses. Significantly, experimental infection of cattle and sheep with BLV revealed that the cELISA accurately monitors seroconversion. In a performance evaluation, the established cELISA displayed a high agreement with Western blotting and the commercial BLV gp51 cELISA kit in the detection of 242 clinical samples, respectively. In conclusion, the novel p24 cELISA exhibited the potential to be a reliable and efficient diagnostic tool for BLV serological detection with a broad application prospect.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Psychogenic nonepileptic (functional) seizures (FS) clinically resemble epileptic seizures (ES) with both often preceded by traumatic brain injury (TBI). FS and ES emergence and occurrence after TBI may be linked to aberrant neurobehavioral stress responses. We hypothesized that neural activity signatures in response to a psychosocial stress task would differ between TBI + FS and TBI + ES after controlling for TBI status (TBI-only). Methods: In the current multicenter study, participants were recruited prospectively from Rhode Island Hospital, Providence Rhode Island Veterans Administration Medical Center, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham Medical Center. Previous diagnoses of TBI, ES, and FS were verified based on data collected from participants, medical chart and record review, and, where indicated, results of EEG and/or video -EEG confirmatory diagnosis. TBI + ES (N = 21) and TBI + FS (N = 21) were matched for age and sex and combined into an initial group (TBI + SZ; N = 42). A TBI-only group (N = 42) was age and sex matched to the TBI with seizures (TBI + SZ) group. All participants completed an fMRI control math task (CMT) and stress math task (SMT) based on the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST). Results: The TBI + SZ group (n = 24 female) did not differ in mood or anxiety severity compared to TBI-only group (n = 24 female). However, TBI + FS group (n = 11 female) reported greater severity of these symptoms compared to TBI + ES (n = 13 female). The linear mixed effects analysis identified neural responses that differed between TBI-only and TBI + SZ during math performance within the left premotor cortex and during auditory feedback within bilateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus/amygdala regions. Additionally, neural responses differed between TBI + ES and TBI + FS during math performance within the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral amygdala during auditory feedback within the supplementary motor area. All tests comparing neural stress responses to psychiatric symptom severity failed to reach significance. Discussion: Controlling for TBI and seizure status, these findings implicate specific nodes within frontal, limbic, and sensorimotor networks that may maintain functional neurological symptoms and possibly distinguish FS from ES. This study provides class II evidence of differences in neural responses to psychosocial stress between ES and FS after TBI.

AB  - This study investigated the antioxidant activity DPPH, ABTS, and Folin-Ciocalteu methods of betulin (compound 1) and its derivatives (compounds 2-11). Skin permeability and accumulation associated with compounds 1 and 8 were also examined. Identification of the obtained products (compound 2-11) and betulin isolated from plant material was based on the analysis of H-1- NMR and C-13-NMR spectra. The partition coefficient was calculated to determine the lipophilicity of all compounds. In the next stage, the penetration through pig skin and its accumulation in the skin were evaluated of ethanol vehicles containing compound 8 (at a concentration of 0.226 mmol/dm(3)), which was characterized by the highest antioxidant activity. For comparison, penetration studies of betulin itself were also carried out. Poor solubility and the bioavailability of pure compounds are major constraints in combination therapy. However, we observed that the ethanol vehicle was an enhancer of skin permeation for both the initial betulin and compound 8. The betulin 8 derivative showed increased permeability through biological membranes compared to the parent betulin. The paper presents the transformation of polycyclic compounds to produce novel derivatives with marked antioxidant activities and as valuable intermediates for the pharmaceutical industry. Moreover, the compounds contained in the vehicles, due to their mechanism of action, can have a beneficial effect on the balance between oxidants and antioxidants in the body, minimizing the effects of oxidative stress. The results of this work may contribute to knowledge regarding vehicles with antioxidant potential. The use of vehicles for this type of research is therefore justified.

AB  - Seabirds are wide-ranging organisms often used to track marine pollution, yet the effect of migration on exposure over the annual cycle is often unclear. We used solar geolocation loggers and stable isotope analysis to study the effects of post breeding dispersal and diet on persistent organic pollutant (POP) and mercury (Hg) burdens in rhinoceros auklets, Cerorhinca monocerata, breeding on islands along the Pacific Coast of Canada. Hg and four classes of POPs were measured in auklet eggs: organochlorine insecticides (OCs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and perfluoralkyl substances (PFASs). Stable isotope values of adult breast feathers grown during winter were used in conjunction with geolocation to elucidate adult wintering latitude. Wintering latitude was the most consistent and significant predictor of some POP and of Hg concentrations in eggs. The magnitude and pattern of exposure varied by contaminant, with PPCBs, PPBDEs and DDE decreasing with wintering latitude, and mirex, perfluoro-n-tridecanoic acid, and Hg increasing with latitude. We suggest that concentrations of these contaminants in rhinoceros auklet eggs are influenced by variation in uptake at adult wintering locations related to anthropogenic inputs and oceanic and atmospheric transport.

AB  - The growing demand for high-performance components in aerospace, medical, and micro-motor industries has accelerated the adoption of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies for producing wear-resistant and durable coatings. Among these, laser cladding is a prominent AM process for fabricating tungsten carbide (WC)-reinforced nickel-based metal matrix composites (MMCs) due to their excellent hardness, thermal stability, and wear resistance. However, issues such as thermal cracking and residual stress remain critical challenges, largely driven by mismatches between WC particles and the Ni-based matrix. This study presents a fully coupled thermomechanical phase-field modeling framework for simulating the laser cladding process of WC-NiCrBSiFe coatings, capturing thermal history, morphology evolution, and crack dynamics during solidification. Parametric investigations indicate that 30 wt% WC achieves the optimal trade-off between hardness, fracture toughness, and resistance to hot cracking. In contrast, higher WC content increases brittleness and residual stress, intensifying crack formation. The novelty of this work lies in introducing a new order parameter for WC particle distribution and incorporating scaled fracture toughness and related properties to enhance the model's predictive accuracy; developing a multi-application simulation framework that integrates multi-scale thermal effects into damage modeling; defining a particle-aware phase-field formulation that simplifies material transitions using a diffusive interface function; and implementing microstructural heterogeneity through Voronoi tessellation to enable realistic simulation of crack propagation mechanisms. These advancements provide a deeper understanding of microstructure-sensitive damage behavior and offer practical guidance for optimizing laser cladding processes in critical AM applications.

AB  - Simple Summary The rhinoceros iguana (Cyclura cornuta cornuta), like many other iguana species, has become severely endangered as a result of human activities, earning the highest level of protection under the CITES convention for protected species. Moreover, it has been classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The rhinoceros iguana belongs to the family Iguanidae and is native to the island of Hispaniola. Since its population has declined, the Canary Island Government has promoted an initiative for its recovery in a completely natural environment. The limited literature regarding the anatomy of this species motivated us to investigate its cranial structures by using modern imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with anatomical dissection, to obtain helpful information on the structures that form the rhinoceros iguana's head. In this paper, we attempted to elaborate on an atlas of the head of the rhinoceros iguana, applying modern imaging techniques such as CT and MRI. Furthermore, by combining the images acquired through these techniques with macroscopic anatomical sections, we obtained an adequate description of the relevant structures that form the head of this species. This anatomical information could provide a valuable diagnostic tool for the clinical evaluation of different pathological processes in iguanas such as abscesses and osteodystrophy secondary to nutrient imbalances, skull malformations, fractures, and neoplasia.

AB  - Hearing impairment is a common disease affecting a substantial proportion of the global population. Currently, the most effective clinical treatment for patients with sensorineural deafness is to implant an artificial electronic cochlea. However, the improvements to hearing perception are variable and limited among healthy subjects. Moreover, cochlear implants have disadvantages, such as crosstalk derived from the currents that spread into non-target tissue between the electrodes. Here, in this work, we describe terahertz wave modulation, a new and minimally invasive technology that can enhance hearing perception in animals by reversible modulation of currents in cochlear hair cells. Using single-cell electrophysiology, guinea pig audiometry, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that THM can reversibly increase mechano-electrical transducer currents (similar to 50% higher) and voltage-gated K+ currents in cochlear hair cells through collective resonance of -C=0 groups. In addition, measurement of auditory brainstem response (ABR) in guinea pigs treated with THM indicated a similar to 10 dB increase in hearing sensitivity. This study thus reports a new method of highly spatially selective hearing enhancement without introducing any exogeneous gene, which has potential applications for treatment of hearing disorders as well as several other areas of neuroscience.

AB  - Simple Summary Feed additives based on medicinal plants, such as neem and moringa plant extracts, are used to mitigate rumen methane emissions, but data regarding their effects on lamb meat quality are scarce. This study investigated the effects of oral supplementation of neem and moringa leaf extracts on the carcass quality and meat fatty acid composition of lambs. Neem leaf extracts had no effect on carcass fat and meat fatty acid composition. Whereas, Moringa leaf extract improved the meat fatty acid composition of lambs compared to the monensin treatment. There is an increased interest in the use of medicinal plants as alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters and as agents for methane production mitigation. This study investigated the effects of Azadirachta indica and Moringa oleifera feed additives on the carcass and meat quality of lambs. Forty South African Mutton Merino lambs, weighing between 29 and 43 kg, were randomly assigned to four treatment groups (n = 10 lambs/treatment) and fed a basal total mixed ration (TMR) containing soybean meal (17%), yellow maize (28%), Alfalfa hay (20%), Eragrostis curvula hay (22.2%), molasses (6.0%), wheat offal (5%), urea (0.8%) and vitamin premix (0.5%) on a DM basis. The dietary treatments: TMR diet (control); TMR diet with A. indica leaf extract (A. indica leaf extract at a dosage of 50 mg per kg of feed: neem); TMR diet with M. oleifera leaf extract (M. oleifera leaf extract at a dosage of 50 mg per kg DM of feed: moringa); TMR diet with monensin (at a dosage of 50 mg monensin sodium per kg of feed: positive control). After an adaptation period of 10 days to the experimental conditions, the lambs from all treatment groups were fed ad libitum with the experimental diets. The lambs were slaughtered at a live weight of 60-65 kg after a 23 week trial period. The plant extract dietary additives had no significant effects on the carcass characteristics of the lambs. In comparison to monensin, supplementing with moringa leaf extracts resulted in a higher proportion of C18:1n9c (45.0% +/- 0.57 vs. 40.5% +/- 0.80; p < 0.05), total MUFAs (47.3% +/- 0.66 vs. 42.6% +/- 0.87; p < 0.05), and UFA:SFA ratio (1.01 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.85 +/- 0.03; p < 0.05), which may be beneficial for human health. Our results suggest that natural feed additives, such as A. indica and M. oleifera leaf extracts, can be included in lamb diets without compromising meat fatty acid composition. The negative economic impacts of such technologies on animal production and farm profitability should not be expected.

AB  - Dioxins might be introduced into the food chain through a direct or an indirect pathway. The main source of human exposure to dioxins is food of animal origin, whereas feeds are the main route of exposure of farmed animals to dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls. The aim of the study was to simulate dioxin passage from feed to tissues on farm animals using transfer models, and, in addition, to assess the risk to consumers of food of animal origin. From over 700 feed samples analyzed over the course of 9 years (2013-2021), those exceeding the maximum permissible levels set down in Commission Regulation No 277/2012/EU were selected. These samples being derived from real cases of dioxin contamination made it possible to present the most realistic picture of the effects these feed materials could have had if they had entered the food chain. Three species of animals were selected (laying hens, dairy cattle and slaughter pigs), for which feed materials with dioxin contents exceeding the maximum permissible level were selected in accordance with the nutritional recommendations. The calcu-lated PCDD/PCDF concentrations in chicken eggs, cow's milk and pork were above the maximum permissible level in most cases.

AB  - Introduction The cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii Glover) is a major global agricultural pest that damages cotton and numerous other economically significant crops through feeding and virus transmission. It possesses high adaptability and rapid reproduction rates, contributing to widespread resistance to chemical insecticides and thereby reducing the effectiveness of such control methods. It should be noted that plants have developed advanced chemical defense mechanisms over long periods of synergistic evolution, allowing them to synthesize volatile compounds. These compounds not only defend against herbivorous insects but also crucially reduce the development of pest resistance. Consequently, this study strives to explore plant-emitted volatiles as a potential eco-friendly alternative for aphid management.Methods In this study, we first tested the behavioral responses of A. gossypii to the volatile blends of fifteen native plant species in Xinjiang, China, using a Y-tube olfactometer and cage experiments. We identified six out of fifteen plant species that were repellent to A. gossypii. We then collected the volatile compounds of repellent plants using a headspace collection method and used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify the key components. The antennal responses of winged A. gossypii to the compounds were evaluated with an antennal potential test. Finally, further testing using a Y-tube olfactometer and Petri dish experiments.Results We identified six out of fifteen plant species (i.e. Anethum graveolens L., Juglans regia L., Rhaponticum repens L., Karelinia caspia Pall., Launaea polydichotoma Ostenf., and Brassica rapa L.) that were repellent to A. gossypii. We collected the volatile compounds of these six repellent plants and identified thirty-one key components. Our electroantennogram (EAG) tests revealed that sixteen of the thirty-one compounds caused significant antennal responses in winged A. gossypii. Further testing using a Y-tube olfactometer and Petri dish experiments confirmed fourteen compounds that repelled intact, winged cotton aphids.Discussion Our study report that the volatiles of four plant species - R. repens, K.caspia, L. polydichotoma, and B. rapa - present a significant repellent effect on winged cotton aphids, suggesting that these compounds might be useful for eco-friendly cotton aphid pest management. These results provide essential theoretical foundations and practical knowledge for the application of plantderived repellent volatiles.

AB  - IntroductionSecondary metabolites in plants play a crucial role in defense mechanisms against insects, pests, and pathogens. These metabolites exhibit varying distributions within and among plant parts under different biotic and abiotic conditions. Understanding the intricate relationships between secondary metabolites and insect populations can be helpful for elucidating plant defense mechanisms and enhancing agricultural managing efficiencies.ObjectiveTo investigate the influence of the glucosinolate profile in the leaves of three cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L.) varieties on insect loads.MethodsGlucosinolate profiles across different leaf positions (such as bottom, middle, and center) and leaf shapes (such as curly and non-curly leaf) of three cabbage varieties (Xiagan [XGA], Xiaguang [XGU], and Qiangxia [QIX]) were analyzed by using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The insect loads were recorded by visually inspecting the upper and lower layers of each target leaf.ResultsIncreasing concentrations of four glucosinolates, namely, glucoiberin, progoitrin, glucoraphanin, and glucobrassicin, were positively related to insect loads. While increasing concentrations of the other four glucosinolates, such as neoglucobrassicin, 4-methoxyglucobrassicin, sinigrin, and gluconapin, were negatively related to insect loads. Furthermore, both glucosinolate synthesis and insect loads were significantly higher in the curly-shaped and middle-position leaves than in the non-curly-shaped and bottom- and central-position leaves across the cabbage varieties.ConclusionDifferences in glucosinolate profiles across leaf positions and shapes strongly influenced the insect loads of the three Brassica varieties. This link may further extend our understanding of the real defense power of a particular variety against herbivore damage.
   This study reveals that specific glucosinolates in three cabbage varieties correlate with insect loads. Higher insect loads were linked to glucoiberin, progoitrin, glucoraphanin, and glucobrassicin, while neoglucobrassicin, 4-methoxyglucobrassicin, sinigrin, and gluconapin showed negative correlations. Curly-shaped and middle-position leaves had higher glucosinolate levels and insect loads. These findings highlight the importance of leaf position and shape in plant defense mechanisms.

AB  - IntroductionToxoplasmosis is one of the most important health-threatening diseases with worldwide distribution and global impact. It is caused by Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), an intracellular apicomplexan parasite that can evade the host immune responses and establish a chronic infection. The available treatments are not efficient against this stage and have many adverse effects. There are no available effective vaccines, apart from Toxovax((R)), which is used in sheep to prevent abortion. Studies documented that prolactin (PRL) had in vivo and in vitro anti-Toxoplasma effects. Detailed research was recommended about the mechanisms of such inhibitory effects.AimThis study was designed to assess the possible protective role of the recombinant prolactin (rPRL) against T. gondii.Materials and MethodsSixty experimentally infected mice with T. gondii were used. The treated mice received rPRL for five days before infection. Serum prolactin levels were measured; survival rate was monitored; number, size, and DNA of T. gondii cysts in the brain were measured; and histopathological and immunological studies were done.ResultsThere was a significant increase in the survival rate of the rPRL-treated mice, a significant decrease in the number, size, and DNA amount of T. gondii cysts in the brain with a noticeable improvement of histopathological lesions in the brain and liver tissues when compared to the infected untreated group. These effects seem to be achieved through stimulating humoral and cell-mediated immune responses that were evident by the significant rise in serum levels of anti-Toxoplasma IgM, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha .ConclusionThe rPRL elicited robust immune responses, which provided efficient protection against murine T. gondii infection.

AB  - Introduction: The Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST) has become a popular test of memory and, in particular, of hippocampal function. It has been heavily used in research settings and is currently included as an alternate outcome measure on a number of clinical trials. However, as it typically requires similar to 15 min to administer and benefits substantially from an experienced test administrator to ensure the instructions are well-understood, its use in trials and in other settings is somewhat restricted. Several different variants of the MST are in common use that alter the task format (study-test vs. continuous) and the response prompt given to participants (old/similar/new vs. old/new).
   Methods: In eight online experiments, we sought to address three main goals: (1) To determine whether a robust version of the task could be created that could be conducted in half the traditional time; (2) To determine whether the test format or response prompt choice significantly impacted the MST's results; and (3) To determine how robust the MST is to repeat testing. In Experiments 1-7, participants received both the traditional and alternate forms of the MST to determine how well the alternate version captured the traditional task's performance. In Experiment 8, participants were given the MST four times over approximately 4 weeks.
   Results: In Experiments 1-7, we found that test format had no effect on the reliability of the MST, but that shifting to the two-choice response format significantly reduced its ability to reflect the traditional MST's score. We also found that the full running time could be cut it half or less without appreciable reduction in reliability. We confirmed the efficacy of this reduced task in older adults as well. Here, and in Experiment 8, we found that while there often are no effects of repeat-testing, small effects are possible, but appear limited to the initial testing session.
   Discussion: The optimized version of the task developed here (oMST) is freely available for web-based experiment delivery and provides an accurate estimate of the same memory ability as the classic MST in less than half the time.

AB  - Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a key diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), interacting with Wnt and Hippo/YAP pathways related to cancer proliferation. Modulating GPC3 gene expression can induce liver cancer cell death by disrupting growth factor signaling, cell adhesion, and metabolic regulation. This study presents the development of a non-viral ultralarge porous CRISPR-Cas9 silica nano-depot to perform targeted GPC3 genome editing for the treatment of HCC. The synthesized ultralarge porous silica nano-depot (UPSND) encapsulates substantial CRISPR-Cas9-ribonucleoprotein complexes with a remarkable 98.3% loading efficiency. The UPSND-mediated GPC3 CRISPR-Cas9 therapy significantly suppresses cancer cell proliferation by modulating the Wnt and Hippo/YAP pathways. The efficiency of GPC3 gene deletion is observed to be 5.1-fold higher than that of commercial lipid-based GPC3 CRISPR-Cas9 in both human and murine genes, with minimal off-target effects. In vivo systemic administration of GPC3 Cas9-RNP@UPSND resulted in preferential accumulation within hepatic tissues in orthotopic HCC mouse models, leading to complete tumor eradication and enhancing T-cell tumor-infiltration. Furthermore, the GPC3 CRISPR-Cas9@UPSND treatment exhibits superior anti-proliferative efficacy in tumor-growth prevention compared to Codrituzumab, as evidenced by the analysis of Ki67 and GPC3 expression, along with serum GPC3 levels. These findings underscore the translational potential of the non-viral UPSND nanoplatform-based CRISPR GPC3 genome editing, offering a promising targeted therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.

AB  - The nutritional components and protein quality of genetically modified maize expressing phytase gene (GM) were analyzed and evaluated in this study. The nutritional components were analyzed by Chinese national standard methods. The ileostomy Bama miniature pigs were utilized to analyze the true digestibility of protein and amino acids. The digestible indispensable amino acid score (DIAAS) was adopted to evaluate the protein quality of GM, its parental maize (PM) and commercial available maize Zhengdan 958 (ZD). Meanwhile, the widely used protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) was also calculated and compared with DIAAS. The content of protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals of all the strains of maize are in the normal ranges of OECD and/or ILSI. The DIAAS of GM, PM, and ZD were 54.57, 31.75, and 33.91, respectively, and the first limiting amino acid for GM, PM, and ZD was lysine. In conclusion, the introduction of phyA2 gene in GM maize does not disturb the digestion of protein/amino acid, but has the ability to promote the digestion of amino acids.

AB  - Introduction: Declining spatial working memory (WM) is an early hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sleep disturbance exacerbates spatial WM and increases AD risk. The GABAergic system, crucial for sleep regulation, may mediate this link. We thus investigate the relationship between spatial WM and hippocampal GABAergic signaling during rapid eye movement sleep deprivation (REM-SD) in AD model mice. Methods: We assessed spatial and non-spatial WM, locomotor activity, and anxiety-like behavior in 6-month-old triple transgenic (3xTg) AD mice and wild-type (WT) controls, with and without REM-SD (5 days, 4 h/day). We then used immunofluorescence to quantify GABA(A)alpha 1, GABA(B)R1, GAD67, and GABA levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus and analyze the correlations with behavioral outcomes. Results: REM-SD increased locomotor activity, reduced anxiety-like behavior, and improved non-spatial WM in 3xTg-AD mice. Conversely, REM-SD impaired spatial WM in WT mice, which was also demonstrated in 3xTg-AD mice. Increased hippocampal GABA levels are correlated with improved non-spatial WM in 3xTg+SD mice. In contrast, impaired spatial WM in WT+SD mice was associated with elevated hippocampal GABA and GABA(B)R1, decreased hippocampal GAD67, and reduced PFC GABA levels. Notably, spatial WM in 3xTg+SD and 3xTg control mice related to increased GABA(A)alpha 1 in the PFC and hippocampus and GAD67 in hippocampal CA1, along with decreased GABABR1 and GAD67 in the dentate gyrus. Conclusion: REM-SD-induced alterations in WM performance are linked to GABAergic signaling changes in the PFC and hippocampus, with distinct patterns in WT and 3xTg-AD mice. This study provides insight into AD pathologies and potential therapeutic targets for sleep-related cognitive impairments.

AB  - Globally, human-wildlife conflict (HWC) is a burning issue, which the conservationists have attempted to address through various conservation strategies. One of the widely adopted strategies is the provision of compensation for the loss caused by wildlife. The existing mechanism of compensation in Nepal is time-consuming and insufficient. This study, therefore, attempts to assess the feasibility of a community-based insurance scheme (CBIS), which is expected to be time-efficient with no additional burden to farmers. The CBIS scheme is an insurance mechanism to be operated by a locally elected committee and provides compensation to the premium paying farmers only. The study was carried out in the Jhapa District of Nepal, one of the most affected districts by wild elephants. We conducted a household survey using a questionnaire for 509 respondents from the five most affected villages. We chose a choice experiment to determine the preferences of respondents for CBIS. Four activities including compensation for crop damage, and human casualties (serious injuries and death), and fence management were selected under the CBIS. The regression analysis revealed that only the compensation for crop damage was statistically significant. The estimated annual crop damage caused by elephants was worth USD 1.49 million. The estimated premium exceeded the expected insurance payout, indicating the suitability of the scheme. The estimated premium was USD 0.38 per hectare for a 1% increase in damage payout. The total annual premium would be USD 0.136 million for a 25% payment of the damage, while the expected annual insurance payout would be USD 77,788. The annual premium can be lower if the government allocates the budget for the CBIS, out of the existing relief distribution program. The engagement of local municipalities in the CBIS management can make the scheme more viable.

AB  - 1-Ethoxy-2,3-difluoro-4-(trans-4-propylcyclohexyl)benzene (EDPrB) is a typical fluorinated liquid-crystal monomer (LCM). LCMs contaminants are becoming increasingly concerning due to their potential persistence, bioaccumulation, toxicity, and broad prevalence in environmental and human samples. However, LCM metabolism is poorly understood. Herein, by introducing selected EDPrB into the appropriate liver microsomes in vitro, we examined the metabolic path-ways of LCM in humans, rats, pigs, Cyprinus carpio, crucian carp, and Channa argus. A total of 20 species-dependent metabolites were identified and structurally elucidated by gas and liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spec-trometry for the first time. Dealkylation, H-abstraction, and hydroxylation reactions are the primary metabolic path-ways. Half of these in vitro metabolites were found in the urine, serum, and fecal samples of Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to EDPrB. Toxicity predictions indicate that 17 metabolites can be classified as toxic. According to the Ecolog-ical Structure Activity Relationships (ECOSAR), a number of metabolites exhibit equivalent or greater aquatic toxicity to that of EDPrB. Toxicity Estimation Software Tool (T.E.S.T.) predicts that some metabolites exhibit developmental toxicity and mutagenicity in rats. These findings suggest that biotransformation should be particularly emphasized, and more toxicological and monitoring studies should be performed to assess the ecological and human safety of LCMs.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Nutritional strategies during pregnancy in swine production are considered essential to increase the number of piglets born alive and improve their survival and development. Amino acids, such as glutamine, are among the best compound to introduce in commercial farms after obtaining positive results in trials carried out in selected swine breeds. However, several critical productive factors have to be assessed before translating these strategies to the farm level to ensure the best balance between benefits and investments. The current study focused on the effects of prenatal L-glutamine supplementation on the offspring of Iberian gilts and sows under farm conditions. It is the first trial of amino acid supplementation during pregnancy carried out in traditional swine breeds. These non-selected swine breeds show productive or physiological differences that could affect the supplementation effect. Indeed, although there were changes at the molecular and tissue level, these effects did not turn into advantageous effects for the offspring of traditional breeds. The present study shows the importance of pre-testing nutritional strategies under the final conditions and breeds of implementation and the need to deepen at the molecular level to improve the biological interpretation of findings.
   The use of amino acids during pregnancy, such as glutamine (Gln), seems to be a promising strategy in selected swine breeds to improve the offspring prenatal development. The main goal of the current study was to assess the development of the offspring from parity 1-3 sows of a traditional breed, which were supplemented with 1% glutamine after Day 35 of gestation, under farm conditions. A total of 486 (288 treated) piglets from 78 (46 treated) Iberian sows were used. At birth and slaughterhouse, fatty acid composition, metabolism, and mTOR pathway gene expression were analyzed. At birth, treated newborns showed greater amounts of specific amino acids in plasma, such as glutamine, asparagine, or alanine, and sigma n-3 fatty acids in cellular membranes than control newborns. The expression of genes belonging to mTOR Complex 1 was also higher in treated piglets with normal birth-weight. However, these findings did not improve productive traits at birth or following periods in litters from supplemented gilts (parity 1) or sows (parities 2-3). Thus, further research is needed to properly understand the effects of prenatal glutamine supplementation, particularly in traditional swine breeds.

AB  - Simple Summary The translocation of elephants is a management tool developed in the 1980s during the culling operations at the Kruger National Park, South Africa, to remove "surplus" elephants from fenced properties. Elephants live in large social networks and form strong social bonds within their family units. In particular, the mother-offspring bond is crucial to the learning and development of social skills and social and environmental competence of the calves. The leadership role and experience of the matriarch appear to be an important factor in providing the necessary knowledge to optimise social and environmental skills and competence. The translocation of smaller groups of elephants results in the social disruption of these networks. This paper looks at the social and ecological aspects of such disruption and what it implies for elephants. A herd of Orphans and a translocated herd consisting of two families were observed over several years. The Orphans demonstrated marked effects of social disruption by splitting more frequently and for longer periods than the family herd and experiencing accelerated reproduction. Social disruption may therefore reduce learning opportunities with implications for elephant society as well as for conservation. African elephants (Loxodonta africana) exhibit a long developmental period during which they acquire complex social and ecological knowledge through social networks. Central to this is that matriarchs and older individuals play an important role as repositories of information gained through experience. Anthropogenic interventions-including poaching, culling, translocation, and hunting-can disrupt elephants' social networks, with implications for individual fitness and potential long-term population viability. Here, we draw on a unique long-running, individual-based dataset to examine the impacts of translocation on a population of elephants in South Africa, taking into consideration demographic rates, social dynamics, and ecological decision-making. Specifically, we compared two translocated groups: a group of unrelated culling Orphans and a family herd. We found that the Orphan group experienced accelerated reproductive rates when compared with the family herd. The Orphan group also fissioned more frequently and for longer periods of time, suggesting lower cohesiveness, and were less decisive in their large-scale movement decisions. These results add to the growing body of literature on the downstream impacts of social disruption for elephants. Whilst the translocation of culling Orphans is no longer practised in South Africa, we encourage careful consideration of any elephant translocation and the resulting social disruption.

AB  - Introduction Stress-related disorders, such as major depression, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder, lead to considerable disease burden and are notoriously difficult to treat. These disorders are characterized by striking sex differences, but the neurobiological underpinnings of the disparities in mental health between men and women remain largely undefined. With an improved understanding of the biological factors that promote or protect against psychopathology, it may become possible to design interventions that enhance resilience. Preclinical research using rodent models can provide fundamental insight into potential sex differences in the neurobiological consequences of stress, which could have important implications for our understanding of stress-related disorders.Methods Towards this end, the current work compared stress-induced alterations in DNA methylation and behavior in male and female c57BL/6 mice. A subchronic stress paradigm consisting of five days of mild stressors was used, and behavioral outcomes were assessed using the elevated plus maze and the light-dark emergence, open field, forced swim and effort-related reward choice tests.Results Statistical analyses using two-way ANOVAs revealed that although some of the effects of stress in the light-dark emergence test were specific to females, both sexes were susceptible to several behavioral consequences of this stress paradigm. Stress was also shown to decrease global DNA methylation in the nucleus accumbens one week following the end of stress exposure in both sexes, but no significant effects were observed two hours following stress. In the hippocampus, no global DNA methylation differences were observed at either time point. Targeted evaluations using methylation-specific PCR revealed sex differences in stress-induced changes in DNA methylation at sites in the prodynorphin and inhibitory kappa B kinase beta genes in the nucleus accumbens. In contrast, no significant sex-by-stress interactions were observed for methylation changes in the hippocampus, although stress significantly increased DNA methylation of prodynorphin and inhibitory kappa B kinase beta two hours after the final stress exposure and reduced methylation of the NEMO and D2 dopamine receptor genes one week following stress.Discussion Overall, these findings provide further evidence of sex differences in stress susceptibility and suggest that sex differences in epigenetic adaptations to stress could contribute to the partially distinct behavioral outcomes of stress in males and females.

AB  - Subterranean termites depend nutritionally on their gut microbiota, which includes protozoa as well as taxonomically and functionally diverse bacteria. Our previous metavirome study revealed a high diversity and novel families of bacteriophages in the guts of Coptotermes formosanus workers from New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. Two assembled bacteriophage genomes (Phages TG-crAlp-04 and 06, family Podoviridae) existed in all colonies and showed similarity to a prophage (ProJPt-Bp1) previously sequenced from a bacterial endosymbiont (Candidatus Azobacteroides pseudotrichonymphae, CAP) of protozoa in the gut of a termite species of the genus Prorhinotermes from Taiwan. In this study the genomes of Phage TG-crAlp-04 and 06 were subjected to detailed functional annotation. Both phage genomes contained conserved genes for DNA packaging, head and tail morphogenesis, and phage replication. Approximately 30% of the amino acid sequences derived from genes in both genomes matched to those of ProJPt-Bp1 phage or other phages from the crAss-like phage group. No integrase was identified; the lack of a lysogeny module is a characteristic of crAss-like phages. Primers were designed to sequence conserved genes of the two phages and their putative host bacterium (CAP) to detect their presence in different termite species from native and introduced distribution ranges. Related strains of the host bacterium were found across different termite genera and geographic regions. Different termite species had separate CAP strains, but intraspecific geographical variation was low. These results together with the fact that CAP is an important intracellular symbiont of obligate cellulose-digesting protozoa, suggest that CAP is a core gut bacterium and co-evolved across several subterranean termite species. Variants of both crAss-like phages were detected in different Coptotermes species from the native and introduced range, but they did not differentiate by species or geographic region. Since similar phages were detected in different termite species, we propose the existence of a core virome associated with core bacterial endosymbionts of protozoa in the guts of subterranean termites. This work provides a strong basis for further study of the quadripartite relationship of termites, protozoa, bacteria, and bacteriophages.

AB  - Introduction This study reports for the first time the complete sequence characteristics of the mitochondrial genome of the tea plant cultivar Camellia sinensis cv. 'Baihaozao'. It systematically unveils its multi-chromosomal structure, RNA editing patterns, and adaptive evolutionary mechanisms, providing critical theoretical insights into the structural complexity and evolutionary mechanisms of the tea plant mitochondrial genome.Methods The mitochondrial genome was fully analyzed using genome sequencing and annotation techniques. RNA editing sites were predicted to evaluate editing patterns. Codon usage bias analysis was conducted to identify high-frequency codons. Repeat sequence analysis was used to characterize dispersed and tandem repeats. Adaptive evolutionary analysis, based on Ka/Ks ratios, was performed to investigate gene selection pressures.Results The mitochondrial genome consists of 11 linear chromosomes, with a total length of 909,843 bp and a GC content of 45.62%. A total of 73 functional genes were annotated, among which 14 variable genes (e.g., ribosomal protein coding genes) retain intact functions without pseudogenization, which is rare among Theaceae plants. RNA editing site prediction revealed significant spatial heterogeneity, with the cox1 gene being a hotspot containing 19 editing sites. Approximately 58.49% of editing events were concentrated on the second base of codons, and 48.61% of the sites resulted in amino acid changes from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Codon usage bias analysis showed significant enrichment of high-frequency codons, including UUU (phenylalanine), AUU (isoleucine), and UUC (phenylalanine). The genome's repeat sequences were predominantly dispersed repeats (70.6%), with forward and palindromic repeats of 30-40 bp being dominant. Tandem repeats exhibited significant distribution heterogeneity among chromosomes. Adaptive evolution analysis showed that most PCGs (protein-coding genes) had Ka/Ks ratios below 1 (ranging from 0.07 to 0.78), with the atp9 gene showing the lowest ratio (0.07), while the mttB gene exhibited a significantly higher Ka/Ks ratio of 3.48. Additionally, 1.62% of the mitochondrial genome sequence was homologous to the chloroplast genome, carrying 26 complete functional genes, including 15 tRNA and 2 rRNA genes.Discussion Codon usage bias may be related to mutation pressure due to the high AT content of the genome or reflect adaptive selection pressures for translational efficiency. The Ka/Ks results align with the widespread purifying selection observed in mitochondrial genomes, while the high Ka/Ks ratio of the mttB gene suggests it might be under positive selection to adapt to environmental pressures. The evolutionary evidence of inter-organelle gene transfer highlights the homologous sequences between mitochondria and chloroplasts. Overall, these findings systematically elucidate the adaptive evolutionary mechanisms and functional regulation of the tea plant mitochondrial genome.

AB  - In exchange for extrafloral nectar, ants deter herbivores from the plants decreasing the herbivore damage, and increasing plant performance in terms of growth and survival. Plants of different sexes may exhibit differences in the investment of resources for defence, thereby differentially decreasing the amount of energy available to other physiological processes. In this context, little is known about sex-related differences in the outcome of ant-plant interactions in plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). In the present study, we conducted ant-exclusion experiments in the field to test for sex-related differences in the outcome of ant-plant interactions in vegetative and reproductive buds of Opuntia robusta in individuals of different sexes in two populations: trioecious and dioecious. We applied tanglefoot to some plant and others were allowed ant access, and measured herbivory, relative growth rates and survival probabilities of buds during the growing season when EFNs are active. We counted the number of ants foraging in EFNs of flowers and cladodes of different sexes. We hypothesized that differences in resource investment to defence between sexes change the outcome of ant-plant interactions in terms of the number of ants foraging on EFNs, herbivory, growth, and survival probabilities. Our results suggest sex-specific strategies in the investment of resources for defence mediated by EFNs in O. robusta, wherein males, females and hermaphrodites from both populations respond differentially to ant presence and herbivores. These sex-related differences affected the outcome of the ant-plant interactions, influencing changes in number of ants foraging on EFNs, and the resulting herbivory, growth and survival of flowers and cladodes among the different sexes and among populations. Our results suggest that the maintenance of EFNs in O. robusta is costly, reflecting some trade-offs between growth/survival and defence. Buds visited by ants tended to grow slowly and survive worse in the trioecious population; in the dioecious population they grew slower but survived better. Overall, a greater number of ants visiting EFNs was related to lower herbivore damage, greater growth and survival of flowers and cladodes. Our study underscores the importance of considering plant sex in the outcome of ant-plant interactions. Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - IntroductionAccumulating evidence highlights the key role of adult neurogenesis events in environmental challenges, cognitive functions and mood regulation. Abnormal hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in anxiety-like behaviors and social impairments, but the possible mechanisms remain elusive.MethodsThe present study questioned the contribution of altered excitation/inhibition as well as excessive neuroinflammation in regulating the neurogenic processes within the Social Decision-Making (SDM) network, using an adult zebrafish model displaying NMDA receptor hypofunction after sub-chronic MK-801 administration. For this, the alterations in cell proliferation and newborn cell densities were evaluated using quantitative 5-Bromo-2 '-Deoxyuridine (BrdU) methodology.ResultsIn short-term survival experiments. MK-801-treated zebrafish displayed decreased cell proliferation pattern within distinct neurogenic zones of telencephalic and preoptic SDM nodes, in parallel to the social withdrawal and anxiety-like comorbidity. BrdU+ cells co-expressed the pro-inflammatory marker IL-1 beta solely in MK-801-treated zebrafish, indicating a role of inflammation. Following the cessation of drug treatment, significant increases in the BrdU+ cell densities were accompanied by the normalization of the social and anxiety-like phenotype. Importantly, most labeled cells in neurogenic zones showed a radial glial phenotype while a population of newborn cells expressed the early neuronal marker TOAD or mGLuR5, the latter suggesting the possible involvement of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in neurogenic events.DiscussionOverall, our results indicate the role of radial glial cell proliferation in the overlapping pathologies of anxiety and social disorders, observed in many neuropsychiatric disorders and possibly represent potential novel targets for amelioration of these symptoms.

AB  - Florida Administrative Code (FAC) 5E-2.0311, "Performance Standards and Acceptable Test Conditions for Preventive Termite Treatments for New Construction," approved in 2003, currently remains without change as originally written. This Code requires broad revision to include updating existing and new termite management methods and technologies, describing acceptable testing protocols that objectively evaluate termite management product efficacy, and clearly and accurately define product performance standards required for approval and use in Florida, USA. This manuscript provides modification and expansion of the existing Code, first in outline form, then followed by a proposed complete revision including detailed explanations for each outline heading and sub-heading. Efficacy requirements, acceptable test conditions, and performance standards requirements are described for termite management products, materials, and non-chemical physical exclusion barriers. We also include testing protocols for field plot and structure efficacy tests. Minimum performance standards also are described for field plots and structure tests to include: (1) termiticide applications to soil, (2) termite baiting systems, (3) pesticides applied directly to wood and building components, (4) pesticide combination mixtures, and (5) new application technologies, products, and methodologies. Although this manuscript addresses revision of a specific Florida Administrative Code, it also is appropriate for consideration by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as well as regulatory entities in other states responsible for pesticide regulation and consumer protection services when writing or revising their code requirements for termite management.

AB  - IntroductionThe Camellia oleifera (C. oleifera) cultivars 'Huashuo' (HS) and 'Huaxin' (HX) are new high-yielding and economically valuable cultivars that frequently encounter prolonged cold weather during the flowering period, resulting in decreased yields and quality. The flower buds of HS sometimes fail to open or open incompletely under cold stress, whereas the flower buds of HX exhibit delayed opening but the flowers and fruits rarely drop. MethodsIn this study, flower buds at the same development stage of two C. oleifera cultivars were used as test materials for a combination of physiological, transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, to unravel the different cold regulatory mechanisms between two cultivars of C. oleifera. Results and discussionKey differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) involved in sugar metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and hormone signal transduction were significantly higher in HX than in HS, which is consistent with phenotypic observations from a previous study. The results indicate that the flower buds of HX are less affected by long-term cold stress than those of HS, and that cold resistance in C. oleifera cultivars varies among tissues or organs.This study will provide a basis for molecular markers and molecular breeding of C. oleifera.

AB  - Pig genome editing using the oviductal nucleic acid delivery (GONAD) method with electroporation would allow the efficient obtention of genetically modified pigs. However, oocytes and zygotes at various stages after ovulation must be targeted, and cumulus cell attachment and mosaic mutations are major obstacles. Therefore, we investigated whether two parameters (electroporation timing and the cumulus cell attachment) influence the effectiveness of multiplex genome editing by electroporation in porcine oocytes or zygotes. Three gRNAs targeting either GGTA1, CMAH or B4GALNT2 were introduced individually into oocytes and zygotes with and without cumulus cells at three different time points, 0 h before in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and 5 h and 10 h after IVF initiation. The introduction of gRNAs into oocytes and zygotes did not significantly affect the rates of blastocyst formation and total mutation of the resulting blastocysts irrespective of cumulus cell attachment and electroporation timing. In conclusion, the electroporation timing and the cumulus cell attachment did not interfere with the efficient delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to the oocytes/zygotes, indicating that porcine genome editing in the oviduct using GONAD method may be possible.

AB  - Domestic pigs have become increasingly popular as a model for human diseases such as neurological diseases. Drug discovery platforms have increasingly been used to identify novel compounds that combat neurodegeneration. Currently, bioactive molecules such as melatonin have been demonstrated to offer a neuroprotective effect in several studies. However, a neurodegenerative platform to study novel compounds in a porcine model has not been fully established. In this study, characterized porcine induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) were used for evaluation of the protective effect of melatonin against chemical and pathogenic stimulation. First, the effects of different concentrations of melatonin on the proliferation of porcine iNSCs were studied. Second, porcine iNSCs were treated with the appropriate concentration of melatonin prior to induced degeneration with dimethyl sulfoxide or Zika virus (ZIKV). The results demonstrated that the percentages of Ki67 expression in porcine iNSCs cultured in 0.1, 1, and 10 nM melatonin were not significantly different from that in the control groups. Melatonin at 1 nM protected porcine iNSCs from DMSO-induced degeneration, as confirmed by a dead cell exclusion assay and mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m) analysis. In addition, pretreatment with melatonin reduced the percentage of dead porcine iNSCs after ZIKV infection. Melatonin increased the Delta psi m, resulting in a decrease in cell degeneration. However, pretreatment with melatonin was unable to suppress ZIKV replication in porcine iNSCs. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the anti-degenerative effect of melatonin against DMSO- and ZIKV-induced degeneration in porcine iNSCs.

AB  - Predation is one of the most important extrinsic factors acting upon animal populations and is a strong selective force in the evolution of form and function. Understanding the impact of predation on bird population dynamics is crucial for understanding the predation pressure of bird populations and implementing conservation strategies, especially for threatened or endemic bird species. In this paper, we sorted the predation events in the wild Crested Ibis population in Yangxian County, Shaanxi Province, from 1981 to 2021 and in the reintroduced Crested Ibis population in Ningshan from 2008 to 2021. With the use of age-classified Leslie matrix models to simulate Crested Ibis populations under different predation pressures, the random population growth rate was estimated, and the impact of predation on population dynamics was evaluated. The results showed that snakes and raptors were the main predators of Crested Ibis in the wild and reintroduced populations, and the number of dead individuals was unevenly distributed within the three age classes in both the wild population (df = 2, chi(2) = 13.236, p < 0.05) and reintroduced population (df = 2, chi(2) = 49.273, p < 0.01). Predation caused a reduction in the potential annual population growth rate of 2.37% (confidence interval [CI]: 2.29-2.45) in the wild population and 2.88% (CI: 2.82-2.94) in the reintroduced population. The overall average growth rates of the wild and reintroduced populations derived from population model simulations were 12.84 and 18.13%, respectively, which suggested that the wild and reintroduced populations was increasing under the current predation pressure and that the impact of predation on the population was acceptable and sustainable.

AB  - In respect of pig instance segmentation, the application of traditional computer vision techniques is constrained by sundries barrier, overlapping, and different perspectives in the pig breeding environment. In recent years, the attention-based methods have achieved remarkable performance. In this paper, we introduce two types of attention blocks into the feature pyramid network (FPN) (see nomenclature table) framework, which encode the semantic interdependencies in the channel (named channel attention block (CAB)) (see nomenclature table) and spatial (named spatial attention block (SAB)) (see nomenclature table) dimensions, respectively. By integrating the associated features, the CAB selectively emphasizes the interdependencies among the channels. Meanwhile, the SAB selectively aggregates the features at each position through a weighted sum of the features at all positions. A dual attention block (DAB) (see nomenclature table) is proposed to integrate CAB features with SAB information flexibly. A total of 45 pigs with 8 pens are captured as the experiment subjects. In comparison with such state-of-art attention modules as convolutional block attention module (CBAM) (see nomenclature table), bottleneck attention module (BAM) (see nomenclature table), and spatial-channel squeeze & excitation (SCSE) (see nomenclature table), embedding DAB can contribute to the most significant performance improvement in different task networks with distinct backbone networks. Especially with HTC-R101-DAB (hybrid task cascade) (see nomenclature table), the best performance is produced, with the AP0.5 (average precision) (see nomenclature table) AP0.75, AP0.5:0.95, and AP0.5:0.95-large reaching 93.1%, 84.1%, 69.4%, and 71.8%, respectively. Also, as indicated by ablation experiments, the SAB contributes more than CAB. Meanwhile, the predictive results appear a trend of increasing initially and decreasing afterwards after different numbers of SAB are merged. Besides, as revealed by the visualization of attention maps, attention blocks can extract regions with similar semantic information. The attention-based models also produce outstanding segmentation performance on public dataset, which evidences the practicability of our attention blocks. Our baseline models are available1.

AB  - After the drastic redevelopment of the banks of the River Meuse in recent years, on both the Dutch and Belgian sides of the river, numerous exceptional exotic plants unexpectedly appeared. Although their precise introduction vector is difficult to determine with certainty, most of these species have most likely germinated from the old, long-buried seed bank that was uncovered by the works. The seeds were introduced many decades ago (at least 50 but perhaps more like 100 years ago, or even longer) via the wool processing industry, about 50 km further upstream, along the River Vesdre in Belgium. Here, we present a commented and illustrated overview of the 59 taxa observed in recent years. They belong to a very limited number of families that are known to have hard, long-lived seeds (mainly Fabaceae and Malvaceae, which together represent 48 taxa). Most taxa are native to the Mediterranean area, but are often widely naturalized elsewhere in the world, including in wool farming areas, while some are endemic to Australia, South Africa, or South America. The following species had not been recorded before in the Netherlands: Cullen cinereum, Dichondra micrantha, Erodium carolinianum, Lotus ornithopodioides, Malva olbia, Malvastrum americanum, Sida acuta, S. rohlenae, S. sivarajanii, Sphaeralcea purpurata, Tarasa tenella, Trifolium hirtum, T. spumosum, and T. squarrosum. Nicotiana glauca was reported for the first time in Belgium. The most remarkable species are depicted. Perhaps these records are of limited relevance for the Dutch and Belgian flora, because - as in the past - probably none of these wool aliens will be able to establish permanently (although this cannot be ruled out entirely, given the changing climate). Our findings highlight the exceptional longevity of seeds of certain plant families.

AB  - Introduction: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant proliferative disease affecting the bone marrow hematopoietic system and has a poor long-term outcome. Exploring genes that affect the malignant proliferation of AML cells can facilitate the accurate diagnosis and treatment of AML. Studies have confirmed that circular RNA (circRNA) is positively correlated with its linear gene expression. Therefore, by exploring the effect of SH3BGRL3 on the malignant proliferation of leukemia, we further studied the role of circRNA produced by its exon cyclization in the occurrence and development of tumors.Methods: Genes with protein-coding function obtained from the TCGA database. we detected the expression of SH3BGRL3 and circRNA_0010984 by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We synthesized plasmid vectors and carried out cell experiments, including cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell differentiation by cell transfection. We also studied the transfection plasmid vector (PLVX-SHRNA2-PURO) combined with a drug (daunorubicin) to observe the therapeutic effect. The miR-375 binding site of circRNA_0010984 was queried using the circinteractome databases, and the relationship was validated by RNA immunoprecipitation and Dual-luciferase reporter assay. Finally, a protein-protein interaction network was constructed with a STRING database. GO and KEGG functional enrichment identified mRNA-related functions and signaling pathways regulated by miR-375.Results: We identified the related gene SH3BGRL3 in AML and explored the circRNA_0010984 produced by its cyclization. It has a certain effect on the disease progression. In addition, we verified the function of circRNA_0010984. We found that circSH3BGRL3 knockdown specifically inhibited the proliferation of AML cell lines and blocked the cell cycle. We then discussed the related molecular biological mechanisms. CircSH3BGRL3 acts as an endogenous sponge for miR-375 to isolate miR-375 and inhibits its activity, increases the expression of its target YAP1, and ultimately activates the Hippo signaling pathway involved in malignant tumor proliferation.Discussion: We found that SH3BGRL3 and circRNA_0010984 are important to AML. circRNA_0010984 was significantly up-regulated in AML and promoted cell proliferation by regulating miR-375 through molecular sponge action.

AB  - Introduction Mid-gestation is a critical period for the development of the nervous system. Exposure to exogenous harmful chemicals during this period may lead to longterm neurological developmental abnormalities in offspring. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is a commonly occurring neurotoxic environmental pollutant that can pass through the placental barrier and blood-brain barrier (BBB), thereby affecting placental nerve development.Methods To investigate the neurotoxic mechanism of B[a]P on offspring exposed in mid-gestation, pregnant rats were exposed to B[a]P (25 mg/kg) from gestation days 8 to 14. Meanwhile, as an agonist of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, lithium chloride (LiCl) was administered to observe the intervention effects.Results The results showed that in rats exposed to B[a]P in mid-gestation, the developmental nodes of the offspring were delayed, and the neurosensory sensitivity of the offspring was reduced. These offspring also had cognitive impairments in adulthood. Subsequent morphological and protein experiments showed that the exposed offspring had reduced neuronal complexity in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, decreased beta-catenin expression, and increased GSK-3 beta expression in the hippocampal tissue. However, all these indexes can be reversed by LiCl.Discussion These results suggest that B[a]P exposed in mid-gestation pregnancy may lead to neurological damage in the offspring by downregulating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.

AB  - The genus Baccharis (Asteraceae) comprises over 440 species distributed along North and South America. Some species of this genus have remarkable invasiveness, and one of these species is the South American shrub Baccharis dracunculifolia DC. Most of the introductions of non-indigenous species are held indirectly through trade, so it is believed that this species could become invasive worldwide with a particular interest in the North American continent because of the increasing sale of products derived from honey to this continent. The resin extracted from B. dracunculifolia is the leading source for preparing the green propolis produced in Southeastern Brazil. Thus, the main objective of this work is to apply an approach based on distribution modeling to investigate possible areas of high environmental suitability for B. dracunculifolia in the North American continent and the potential to the entire globe using current and two future scenaries. Our results show many areas of environmental suitability for B. dracunculifolia. This species can invade over 33 countries distributed into five continents, including North America, some of the most critical parts of the southern USA, and large areas in Mexico. Since the best way of countering biological invasions is prevention, we propose that the introduction of this species should be monitored.

AB  - Bats are often associated with several zoonotic diseases, including helminth infections. Despite their potential detrimental effects on both human and bat populations, information on helminth parasites of Philippine bats remains scarce. Here, we identify gastrointestinal helminths parasitizing bats collected from a cave complex in Cavinti, Laguna Province, Philippines, determine their prevalence (P) and mean intensity (MI), and investigate relationship of helminth prevalence and intensity with bat host characteristics including sex, diet, age, and roosting habit. We isolated 581 individuals of helminths representing six taxa (three trematodes, two nematodes, one cestode) from the gastrointestinal tract of sampled bats. Helminths were observed in 82 out of 172 bats captured (P = 47.67%), with Miniopteruspaululus having the highest infection rate (P = 91.3%) and highest MI (18 +/- 4.5/infected bat). Helminths parasitizing endemic bat species from the Philippines, such as Rhinolophus rufus, Rhinolophus inops, Hipposideros pygmaeus, and Ptenochirus jagori were reported here for the first time. We provide new host records for other helminth species and report the presence of two parasites, Plagiorchis sp. and Toxocara sp., known for their zoonotic potential. These data will contribute to efforts in identifying parasites and diseases harbored by bats in the country and develop additional conservation measures for bats.

A variabledata-independent acquisition (vDIA)-based spatial-omics strategy integratedwith unsupervised variational autoencoders was applied to profilethe functional mechanism underlying the action of Lactobacilluscasei-derived postbiotic supplementation in goat milkdigestion in an infant digestive system, from a metabolomics-peptidomics-proteomicsperspective. Amide and olefin derivatives were proved to elevate theactivities of pepsin and trypsin through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobicforces based on allosteric effects, and recognition of nine endopeptidasesand their cleavage to serine, proline, and aspartate were introducedby postbiotics, thereby promoting the generation of hydrophilic peptidesand elevating the bioaccessibility of goat milk protein. The peptidesoriginating from & alpha;s1-casein, & beta;-casein, & beta;-lactoglobulin,Ig-like domain-containing protein, & kappa;-casein, and serum amyloidA protein, with multiple bioactivities including angiotensin I-convertingenzyme (ACE)-inhibitory, osteoanabolic, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV)inhibitory, antimicrobial, bradykinin-potentiating, antioxidant, andanti-inflammatory activities, were significantly increased in thepostbiotic supplementation group, which was also considered to potentiallyprevent necrotizing enterocolitis through inhibiting the multiplicationof pathogenic bacteria and blocking signal transducer and activatorof transcription 1 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer ofactivated B cells inflammatory pathways. This research deepened theunderstanding of the mechanism underlying the postbiotics affectinggoat milk digestion, which established a critical groundwork for theclinical application of postbiotics in infant complementary foods.

AB  - Author summary The pig is an animal commonly used experimentally to study diseases of the heart, as well as investigate therapies to treat them, such as drugs. However, although similar, pigs differ from humans in certain aspects which may mean experimental results do not always directly translate between species. We propose a mathematical model of porcine electrophysiology which can serve as a tool to understand differences between the species and translate responses. Using new measurements along with values from literature, we built a computer model of porcine cardiac myocyte which replicated voltage and calcium behaviour over a range of pacing frequencies. The pig cell had a two-stage calcium release, unlike humans with a single stage. We predict that pigs and humans differ in the type of potassium current block that makes them most susceptible to cardiac arrhythmia. The model we developed can elucidate important differences between human and pig arrhythmia response.
   The pig is commonly used as an experimental model of human heart disease, including for the study of mechanisms of arrhythmia. However, there exist differences between human and porcine cellular electrophysiology: The pig action potential (AP) has a deeper phase-1 notch, a longer duration at 50% repolarization, and higher plateau potentials than human. Ionic differences underlying the AP include larger rapid delayed-rectifier and smaller inward-rectifier K+-currents (I-Kr and I-K1 respectively) in humans. AP steady-state rate-dependence and restitution is steeper in pigs. Porcine Ca2+ transients can have two components, unlike human. Although a reliable computational model for human ventricular myocytes exists, one for pigs is lacking. This hampers translation from results obtained in pigs to human myocardium. Here, we developed a computational model of the pig ventricular cardiomyocyte AP using experimental datasets of the relevant ionic currents, Ca2+-handling, AP shape, AP duration restitution, and inducibility of triggered activity and alternans. To properly capture porcine Ca2+ transients, we introduced a two-step process with a faster release in the t-tubular region, followed by a slower diffusion-induced release from a non t-tubular subcellular region. The pig model behavior was compared with that of a human ventricular cardiomyocyte (O'Hara-Rudy) model. The pig, but not the human model, developed early afterdepolarizations (EADs) under block of I-K1, while I-Kr block led to EADs in the human but not in the pig model. At fast rates (pacing cycle length = 400 ms), the human cell model was more susceptible to spontaneous Ca2+ release-mediated delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered activity than pig. Fast pacing led to alternans in human but not pig. Developing species-specific models incorporating electrophysiology and Ca(2+-)handling provides a tool to aid translating antiarrhythmic and arrhythmogenic assessment from the bench to the clinic.

AB  - Ambient temperature is a main parameter that determines the thriving and propagation of ectothermic insects. It affects egg and larval development as well as adults' survival and successful overwintering. Pyrrhocoris apterus is a herbivorous bug species almost ubiquitous in Eurasia. Its distribution extends from the Atlantic Coast to Siberia, Northwest China and Mongolia. After introduction, it established successfully in the USA, Central America, India and Australia, which indicates a high invasive potential of this species. We determined the climatic conditions in Central Europe in a habitat where P. apterus has been continuously observed for decades. We conducted temperature measurements in the habitat and in the microhabitats where individuals could be found during the year and set them against freely available climate data commonly used to characterize habitat climate. Our temperature measurements were also compared to thermal limits (critical thermal minima and maxima). Although ambient temperatures outside the thermal boundaries of P. apterus can and do occur in the habitat, the bugs thrive and propagate. Microhabitat measurement in winter showed that individuals sought areas with favorable temperatures for hibernation. In particular, these areas are not (always) represented in large-scale climate tables, leading to possible misinterpretation of future patterns of spread of invasive species spread.

AB  - The pursuit of alternative ingredients with improved environmental sustainability, nutritive value, and cost efficiency is crucial for modern pork production systems. Replacing soybean meals has the potential to reduce environmental impacts. This study proposes a substitution framework in which alternative ingredients are introduced to replace a growing proportion of soybean meals based on net energy equivalence. Additionally, an optimisation framework has been proposed that simultaneously addresses multiple objectives, including cost, feed weight, environmental impacts, and essential nutritional requirements. Eighteen feed mixes were obtained by introducing alternative ingredients selected from an extensive, if not systematic, literature review. Therefore, black soldier fly meal (BSF), bakery by-product (BP), and pea (P) have been introduced in feed mixes, and feed mixes were evaluated across ten environmental impact categories via a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach (ISO 14040-44), with two different functional units: 1 kg of feed mix and 1 kg of pig meat at the slaughterhouse. To assess the robustness of the optimised feed mixes under uncertainty, a cost and climate change sensitivity analysis was conducted. The results demonstrated that the introduction of BSF increased costs and environmental impacts at the single-score level (by 280% and 118%, respectively), with differences at the single-impact category level. In contrast, BP and P emerged as the most effective solutions in the substitution and optimisation approaches, respectively. BP contributed to a reduction in environmental impacts of up to 9% in optimised diets, while P achieved economic cost savings of up to 28% compared to the original diet. These findings highlighted the need to strike a balance between environmental benefits and financial viability, underscoring the importance of policy support and market incentives to make sustainable practices more accessible.

AB  - Territorial Life Cycle Assessment (TLCA) appears a promising method to support informed decision making of local actors in territorial agricultural production systems (TAPS), by assessing environmental impacts of agricultural activities and potential strategies. The objectives of this study were to i) adapt TLCA methodology to integrated environmental assessment of TAPS and ii) evaluate TLCA?s contribution to supporting informed decision making by assessing scenarios of change in TAPS. A TLCA of the agricultural sector was performed for a territory in the Aube department in France, including main crops and animal production types from raw material extraction to the first stage of processing. Exchanges of agricultural products and by-products among agricultural subsectors were considered by allocating impacts, which prevented double-counting them. Two contrasting scenarios were assessed with TLCA ? development of on-farm biogas production and reintroduction of sheep grazing ? and compared to the current situation. Results were expressed per unit area (ha), per unit biomass produced (kg) and per percentage contribution to total impacts of the territory before and after processing (at and beyond the farm gate, respectively). The main contributors (cereal and oilseed crops) did not have the highest impact at the farm scale (per ha and per kg), which highlights that contribution to total impacts of the territory is a relevant addition to the impacts per functional unit. Consideration of exchanges showed that TLCA can be used to assess effects of material interactions (biomass flows) between sectors. Scenario results showed no significant differences in impacts, except for higher water resource depletion for the biogas scenario, because most differences between scenarios were smaller than uncertainties in the input data. Other challenges were identified, such as the need to evaluate consequences of changes beyond the territory gate when performing TLCA of scenarios or the utility of characterizing the network of biomass flows in more detail. In conclusion, the methodological framework that was developed successfully identified environmental hotspots and reflected environmental impacts of material interactions between actors. Finally, it can estimate environmental impacts of future strategies, as long as uncertainty is reduced; thus, it shows potential as a decision-support tool.

AB  - Simple Summary Porcine Circovirus Type 2 (PCV2) vaccination is a widespread measure that effectively reduces infection prevalence in swine farms. However, this tool has failed to eradicate the infection, probably because of the persistence of PCV2 in the environment of the farms. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of PCV2 in different areas of swine farms to identify critical points which may act as possible viral reservoirs. Four farrow-to-wean long-term vaccinated farms were studied, sampling different surfaces from animal and non-animal areas and analyzing them by qPCR to detect and quantify the PCV2 load. The results show the near absence of PCV2 in animal areas; in contrast, the virus is frequently detected in offices, farm staff clothing and the farm perimeter. As PCV2 vaccination does not provide sterilizing immunity, the detected viral load is probably the result of low shedding from subclinically infected animals on the farm; thus, PCV2 would tend to accumulate in areas not cleaned and disinfected regularly. Nevertheless, an external source of PCV2 cannot be totally ruled out. This study shows the existence of potential critical points for PCV2 persistence in vaccinated farms, indicating the need of considering them for future eradication plans. Vaccination against Porcine Circovirus Type 2 (PCV2) even over several years has proven as an insufficient measure to eradicate the infection from farms, possibly due to not producing sterilizing immunity. Viral persistence in the farm environment has been proposed as a possible cause of reinfection, and for that reason, the main objective of this study was to identify potential critical points where PCV2 could persist in farrow-to-wean farms which had been vaccinating piglets for years. Surface samples were collected from different farm facilities with and without animals and analyzed by qPCR to detect and quantify the viral load. Most of the samples taken in animal housing facilities tested negative (96.6%); however, PCV2 was more frequently detected in samples from the offices (37.5%), the farm staff (25%) and the perimeter (21%). These results indicate that PCV2 contamination is frequent in facilities despite the long-term use of vaccination programs. Therefore, PCV2 control programs should include more exhaustive cleaning and disinfection protocols in non-animal facilities, as well as the implementation of specific biosecurity measures in these areas to minimize the risk of PCV2 introduction from external sources.

AB  - Surra is an infectious disease caused by Trypanosoma evansi (T. evansi), which is spread in developing countries. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and genetic characterization of T. evansi in cattle in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Blood samples from 150 cattle were collected and examined by a blood smear and PCR targeting the RoTat 1.2VSG gene. The findings revealed that the prevalence of T. evansi varied depending on the detection test, ranging from 20.7% to 25.3% by blood smear examination and PCR. RoTat 1.2VSG sequences analysis of two T. evansi isolates revealed little difference compared to similar sequences in the database. The phylogenetic tree revealed that local T. evansi isolates in this study were clustered with other T. evansi sequences from Egypt, India, Nigeria, Kenya, and Pakistan. The sequences in the study and the Egyptian sequence (MG674485, camel strain) were grouped into a single clade with little genetic variation. In conclusion, the results of this study urge for the introduction and adoption of appropriate control strategies to reduce the effect of T. evansi infection on cattle production in Saudi Arabia.

AB  - IntroductionComposting is a highly effective method for managing the growing quantity of agricultural waste, promoting nutrient recycling, and advancing sustainable agriculture. However, the significant amounts of volatile inorganic compounds (VICs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) generated during the composting process cannot be ignored due to their serious ecological environmental hazards and detrimental impact on human health. The types and pathways of VICs and VOCs produced during the composting process remain not well understood. MethodsIn this study, we investigated the VOCs produced during chicken manure and straw composting using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). We performed qualitative and quantitative analyses of VOCs in composting emissions gases and their correlation with odor. ResultsOur results showed that 44 VOCs were detected during composting, including 4 oxidation-containing compounds, 2 sulfur-containing organics, 5 alkanes, 19 halogenated compounds, and 14 aromatic compounds. Aromatic compounds were found to be the main component of VOCs, accounting for 59.14% of the total content. The highest VOC content was found in the pre-composting period, and the highest emitting VOC was p-Isopropyl Toluene, which reached 7870.50 mu g/m(3). We identified eight substances that were highly correlated with odor concentration (p < 0.01) and are the main odor-causing substances that need to be monitored and controlled. DiscussionOur study provides important insights into the transformation of volatile gases during the composting process. It highlights the need for proper management practices to control VOCs emissions and reduce their environmental impact.

AB  - Since determining the weight of pigs during large-scale breeding and production is challenging, using noncontact estimation methods is vital. This study proposed a novel pig weight prediction method based on a modified mask region-convolutional neural network (mask R-CNN). The modified approach used ResNeSt as the backbone feature extraction network to enhance the image feature extraction ability. The feature pyramid network (FPN) was added to the backbone feature extraction network for multi-scale feature fusion. The channel attention mechanism (CAM) and spatial attention mechanism (SAM) were introduced in the region proposal network (RPN) for the adaptive integration of local features and their global dependencies to capture global information, ultimately improving image segmentation accuracy. The modified network obtained a precision rate (P), recall rate (R), and mean average precision (MAP) of 90.33%, 89.85%, and 95.21%, respectively, effectively segmenting the pig regions in the images. Five image features, namely the back area, body length, body width, average depth, and eccentricity, were investigated. The pig depth images were used to build five regression algorithms (ordinary least squares (OLS), AdaBoost, CatBoost, XGBoost, and random forest (RF)) for weight value prediction. AdaBoost achieved the best prediction result with a coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.987, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.96 kg, a mean square error (MSE) of 12.87 kg 2 , and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 8.45%. The results demonstrated that the machine learning models effectively predicted the weight values of the pigs, providing technical support for intelligent pig farm management. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Introduction Articular cartilage is an avascular, aneural, and lymphatic tissue with limited capacity to regenerate. Numerous techniques have been employed to repair or regenerate; however, the success rate varies. In fact, most of them result in the formation of fibrocartilage, not hyaline cartilage. The future of treating cartilage defects lies in providing biological solutions through cartilage regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a promising therapy for cartilage regeneration. These cells secrete factors that enhance cartilage repair. This study studied the effects of intra-articular injection of human umbilical cord MSC (hUC-MSC) secretome on cartilage damage in a sheep model. Methods Standardized rectangular (5x5 mm) full-thickness chondral defects were created in the lateral femoral condyle of 15 adult sheep and debrided down to the subchondral bone plate. Three treatment groups were tested: 4 microfracture perforations using 1.0mm diameter awls (group 1), intra-articular injection of hUC-MSC secretome (group 2), and a combination of microfracture and intra-articular injection of hUC-MSC secretome (group 3). The osteochondral repair was assessed at 6 months using an established macroscopic and histological analyses. Results Macroscopically, combined therapy application shows significant cartilage repair improvement compared to microfracture alone (p=0.004). Microscopically, the application of combined therapy shows significant improvement of cartilage repair compared to secretome injection alone (p=0.031). Conclusion Microfracture combined with injection of hUCB-MSCs secretome could be an effective alternative for repairing articular cartilage defects in vivo.

AB  - Silicon (Si) plays a pivotal role in enhancing plant resilience against abiotic stressors, yet the precise mechanisms underlying its potential in mitigating cadmium toxicity in camelina remain poorly elucidated. This study focuses on examining the impact of different treatments of foliar Si such as 0 ppm Si with 0 ppm Cd (T0Cd0), 2.5 ppm Si with 0 ppm Cd (T1Cd0), 5 ppm Si with 0 ppm Cd (T2Cd0), 0 ppm Si with 5 ppm Cd (T0Cd1), 2.5 ppm Si with 5 ppm Cd (T1Cd1), and 5 ppm with 5 ppm Cd (T2Cd1) application on two camelina cultivars cultivated under hydroponic conditions of cadmium-induced stress. Cadmium stress significantly impaired various aspects of plant development, including growth parameters, photosynthetic pigments, and the activities of key antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, and catalase. Additionally, cadmium accumulation was higher in both root and leaf tissues under stress. The Canadian cultivar demonstrated greater susceptibility to cadmium at a concentration of 5 ppm compared to the Australian cultivar. However, the introduction of silicon at a concentration of 5 ppm effectively alleviated the toxic effects of cadmium, with the Australian cultivar showing a more substantial response relative to the Canadian counterpart. These findings highlight silicon's crucial role in mitigating cadmium toxicity in camelina, enhancing growth and antioxidant defenses under stress.

AB  - Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is regarded as a significant risk factor for gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer. However, the increasing resistance of H. pylori strains has resulted in low eradication rates and ineffective treatments. Herein, we report on identification of a new quipazine derivative-compound <bold>9c</bold> (N-(3-chlorobenzyl)-2-(piperazin-1-yl)quinolin-4-amine), which displayed antibacterial properties (MIC range 2-4 mu g/mL) against H. pylori CagA-positive reference strains associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer, including metronidazole-resistant ATCC 43504, clarithromycin-resistant ATCC 700684 and susceptible J99 strain, as well as clinical, multidrug-resistant isolate (3CML, resistant to clarithromycin, metronidazole and levofloxacin). Compound <bold>9c</bold> showed bacteriostatic activity (MBC/MIC ratio > 4), demonstrated antibiofilm-forming properties and prevented auto-aggregation of microbial cells. It also displayed an additive effect in 1/2 MIC (2 mu g/mL) when administered with clarithromycin and/or metronidazole. Compound <bold>9c</bold> had no impact on gut microbiota reference strains of S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecalis and L. paracasei as well as no hemolytic activity against sheep erythrocytes. Finally, by reducing the viability of the SNU-1 human gastric cancer cell line (IC50 = 3.28 mu g/mL), compound <bold>9c</bold> might offer important implications regarding the oncogenic characteristics of cagA+ H. pylori strains.

AB  - The sense of smell allows for the assessment of the chemical composition of volatiles in our environment. Different factors are associated with reduced olfactory function, including age, sex, as well as health and lifestyle conditions. However, most studies that aimed at identifying the variables that drive olfactory function in the population suffered from methodological weaknesses in study designs and participant selection, such as the inclusion of convenience sample or only of certain age groups, or recruitment biases.We aimed to overcome these issues by investigating the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) cohort, a population-based cohort, by using a validated odor identification test. Specifically, we hypothesized that a series of medical, demographic and lifestyle variables is associated with odor identification abilities. In addition, our goal was to provide clinicians and researchers with normative values for the Sniffin' Sticks identification set, after exclusion of individuals with impaired nasal patency.We included 6,944 participants without acute nasal obstruction and assessed several biological, social, and medical parameters. A basic model determined that age, sex, years of education, and smoking status together explained roughly 13% of the total variance in the data. We further observed that variables related to medical (positive screening for cognitive impairment and for Parkinson's disease, history of skull fracture, stage 2 hypertension) and lifestyle (alcohol abstinence) conditions had a negative effect on odor identification scores. Finally, we provide clinicians with normative values for both versions of the Sniffin' Sticks odor identification test, i.e. with 16 items and with 12 items.

AB  - Background Targeted knock-in assisted by the CRISPR/Cas9 system is an advanced technology with promising applications in various research fields including medical and agricultural sciences. However, improvements in the efficiency, precision, and specificity of targeted knock-in are prerequisites to facilitate the practical application of this technology. To improve the efficiency of targeted knock-in, it is necessary to have a molecular system that allows sensitive monitoring of targeted knock-in events with simple procedures. Methods and results We developed an assay, named CD55 correction assay, with which to monitor CD55 gene correction accomplished by targeted knock-in. To create the reporter clones used in this assay, we initially introduced a 7.7-kb heterozygous deletion covering CD55 exons 2-5, and then incorporated a truncating mutation within exon 4 of the remaining CD55 allele in human cell lines. The resultant reporter clones that lost the CD55 protein on the cell membrane were next transfected with Cas9 constructs along with a donor plasmid carrying wild-type CD55 exon 4. The cells were subsequently stained with fluorescence-labeled CD55 antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry to detect CD55-positive cells. These procedures allow high-throughput, quantitative detection of targeted gene correction events occurring in an endogenous human gene. Conclusions The current study demonstrated the utility of the CD55 correction assay to sensitively quantify the efficiency of targeted knock-in. When used with the PIGA correction assay, the CD55 correction assay will help accurately determine the efficiency of targeted knock-in, precluding possible experimental biases caused by cell line-specific and locus-specific factors.

AB  - Digestion is primarily performed by digestive enzymes. Here, we examined the activity levels of seven digestive enzymes along the digestive tract of the herbivorous fish, Cebidichthys violaceus. We reared C. violaceus on carnivore, omnivore, and herbivore diets in the laboratory for nine months and compared the digestive enzyme activities among the fish on the different diets and with wild-caught fish consuming their natural foods. Enzymatic activities were generally lower in the laboratory than in wild-caught fish. The marked anterior-to-posterior amylase activity gradient along the gut in wild-caught fish was absent in the lab-fed fish. We hypothesize that the dampened enzymatic activity may have been caused by reduced food intake in the laboratory in comparison to the wild fish. N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAGase) activity (degrades chitin breakdown products) peaked in the distal intestines of the lab-fed fish, but not the wild fish. The role of this enzyme in the digestive process remains unknown since the lab diets contained no chitin, and its origin may have been microbial. Overall, C. violaceus can tolerate diets with a wide range of protein and carbohydrate levels. However, the totality of our data suggests that live algal diets may be best for this herbivorous fish in a captive setting, especially for aquaculture.

AB  - Invasive drywood termites are one of the most challenging species to detect in the early invasion process as they can infest a small piece of wood and be transported by human activity. Cryptotermes domesticus (Haviland, 1898) is native to south Asia and Australia and has been introduced into many other Asian countries and pacific islands, where they cause damage to furniture and wooden structures. Recently, an established colony of C. domesticus has been found in the Seoul metropolitan area, Republic of Korea, where drywood termites were not thought to be able to establish due to low winter temperatures. The discovery of C. domesticus was initiated from a post on an internet forum in which an anonymous homeowner collected alates in an apartment and asked for pest identification. This information was readily delivered to professional entomologists, and a task force was formed for inspection. During the thorough inspection, an infested sliding door frame was identified and a colony of C. domesticus was found. Instead of fumigation and localized pesticide treatment, the door and frame were removed and replaced, which was the most cost-effective control measure as the colony was only found there. Since the potential spread of C. domesticus is uncertain, the task force collaborated with the media, including newspapers and broadcasting news, to disseminate information to help recognize any additional unreported infestations. This study provides insights on how to cooperate with the media and citizens when a new invasive species is found.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to characterize the dry-cured loin and dry-cured "cachaco" of Bisaro pork and evaluate the effect of the inclusion of olive cake in the animals' diet on the cured products. For this purpose, forty loins and forty "cachacos" were used, followed by a process of cold curing with controlled ventilation, without adding nitrites or synthetic additives. The dry-cured loin and "cachaco" chemical compositions were significantly different in moisture, total fat, protein, chlorides, ash, and haem pigments. The "cachaco" showed a much higher value of total fat and a lower protein value. Its chloride content was lower and was related to the lower ash percentage. Neither product differed significantly in the water activity and collagen content. The proportions of saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids were significantly different between these products. The dry-cured "cachaco" showed higher values of SFA and PUFA, and the dry-cured loin had higher MUFA content. No significant effect of different olive cakes on diet was observed in the chemical compositions. Both products are of high quality and with good nutritional and physicochemical characteristics, and the introduction of olive cake in the diet did not affect any of the quality parameters analyzed.

AB  - Biochar is known to accelerate composting process and improve the quality of end-products. However, its effects on bioconversion of organic waste by black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) remains largely unexamined. To investigate the effects of corn straw biochar (CS-BC) on bioconversion of soybean dregs (SD) by BSFL, SD was amended with four different dosages of CS-BC [0%, 2%, 5%, and 8% (w/w)] and digested by BSFL for ten days. The results indicated that the peak values of single larva wet weight in the treatments amended with CS-BC were advanced by 2-3 days and the reduction rate of SD increased from 72.09% to 85.37% with the increasing dosage of CS-BC. Meanwhile, SD mixed with 2%, 5% and 8% of CS-BC decreased ammonia (NH3) emission by 2.7%, 3.6% and 18.0%, respectively. The nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions reduced (-23.6%, -29.1% and -49.2%) with 2%, 5% and 8% CS-BC additions, respectively. In addition, the residual nitrogen of SD-nitrogen proportionally increased with CS-BC application (28.3%, 28.6%, 30.1% and 35.0% for application at the dosage of 0%, 2%, 5% and 8%, respectively). Based on the comprehensive evaluation of bioconversion performance, alleviation of pollutant gas emission, and nitrogen conservation, we recommend the introduction of 8% (w/w) CS-BC during bioconversion of SD by BSFL. This study confirmed the feasibility of CS-BC as an amendment for the BSFL-based bioconversion system.

AB  - Introduction: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with hippocampal system structural and functional impairments. Neurobiological models of PTSD posit that contextual memory for traumatic events is impaired due to hippocampal system dysfunction whilst memory of sensory details is enhanced due to amygdalar impact on sensory cortices. If hippocampal system dysfunction is a core feature of PTSD, then non-traumatic hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions such as scene construction, spatial processing, and memory should also be impaired in individuals with PTSD.
   Methods: Forty-six trauma survivors, half diagnosed with PTSD, performed two tasks that involved spatial processing. The first was a scene construction task which requires conjuring-up spatially coherent multimodal scenarios, completed by all participants. Twenty-six participants (PTSD: n = 13) also completed a navigation task in a virtual environment, and underwent structural T1, T2 and diffusion-tensor MRI to quantify gray and white matter integrity. We examined the relationship between spatial processing, neural integrity, and symptom severity in a multiple factor analysis.
   Results: Overall, patients with PTSD showed impaired performance in both tasks compared to controls. Scenes imagined by patients were less vivid, less detailed, and generated less sense of presence; importantly they had disproportionally reduced spatial coherence between details. Patients also made more errors during virtual navigation. Two components of the multiple factor analysis captured group differences. The first component explained 25% of the shared variance: participants that constructed less spatially coherent scenes also made more navigation errors and had reduced white matter integrity to long association tracts and tracts connecting the hippocampus, thalamus, and cingulate. The second component explained 20% of the variance: participants who generated fewer scene details, with less spatial coherence between them, had smaller hippocampal, parahippocampal and isthmus cingulate volumes. These participants also had increased white matter integrity to the right hippocampal cingulum bundle.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that patients with PTSD are impaired at imagining even neutral spatially coherent scenes and navigating through a complex spatial environment. Patients that showed reduced spatial processing more broadly had reduced hippocampal systems volumes and abnormal white matter integrity to tracts implicated in multisensory integration.

AB  - Introduction Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global health problem frequently associated with biochemical disturbance and also, with a range of mental health disorders including such as anxiety and depression. Whereas, mercury chloride (HgCl2) is a common environmental pollutant, which is neurotoxic and induces oxidative stress, especially in metabolic disorders like diabetes. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the interaction between hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and HgCl2 toxicity and to assess their far-reaching effect spotlighted on biochemical and behavioral disturbances. By analyzing key oxidative stress markers and anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Experimental design was carried out as follow: control group, HgCl2-treated group, diabetic group and diabetic HgCl2-treated group. Type 2 diabetes was induced in a diabetic model via streptozotocin (STZ) and nicotinamide (NA) injections. For the HgCl2-exposed groups, rats were administered 0.375 mg/kg/day of HgCl2 orally for 45 consecutive days. Additionally, behavioral tests were performed to examine anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and hematological, biochemical, oxidative stress markers were assessed to evaluate systemic and neurotoxic effects. The results showed significant increases in fasting blood glucose levels in diabetic and HgCl2-treated diabetic groups compared to controls (p < 0.001). Body weight significantly decreased in all treated groups (p < 0.05), with the greatest reduction observed in the HgCl2-treated diabetic group. Behavioral analysis revealed heightened anxiety and depression-like behaviors, particularly in the HgCl2-treated diabetic group (p < 0.05). Biochemical assessments indicated significant disruptions in lipid profiles and hepatic and renal markers, with pronounced effects in HgCl2-treated diabetic rats (p < 0.05). Oxidative stress markers demonstrated elevated malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels in the liver, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex, paired with diminished antioxidant defences, including catalase and superoxide dismutase activities (p < 0.05). These findings underscore the synergistic role of hyperglycemia and HgCl2 exposure in amplifying oxidative damage and emotional disturbances, suggesting a critical interplay between metabolic and neurotoxic pathways.

AB  - Introduction Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) produces nitric oxide, which is essential for a variety of physiological functions in the brain. Previous work has demonstrated the detrimental effects of eNOS deficiency on brain function in male eNOS knockout (eNOS KO) mice. However, the effect of eNOS deficiency on brain structure and any association between these effects and sex is unknown. Methods This study used three-dimensional high-resolution ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral tests of anxiety and cognitive performance to investigate structure-function relationships in the brain of female and male eNOS KO mice in young adulthood. Results While there were no differences in anxiety-like behavior or locomotion, there was a sex-specific deficit in contextual fear memory retention in male, but not in female, eNOS mice compared to wild-type controls. Moreover, we found that eNOS deficiency induced changes in multiple brain regions that are involved in learning and fear memory including the hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, and areas of the cortex. Several of these MRI-detectable neuroanatomical changes were dependent on sex. Conclusion The observation that eNOS deficiency impacts brain structure at an early age demonstrates the importance of eNOS for healthy brain development.

AB  - Outdoor group housing is generally reported as being beneficial to the welfare of horses compared to single boxes, being considered to show greater similarities with the living conditions of feral horses, allowing full expression of behaviours such as grazing, social interactions and free movement. However, concerns persist regarding the ability to maintain a good nutritional state and the possibility of acquiring injury. No data reporting a comprehensive assessment of welfare for horses in outdoor group-housing systems are currently available. The present study aimed at applying a scientifically valid welfare assessment protocol to group-housed outdoor horses in 'parcours', a particular management system used in the south of France. 'Parcours' are semi-natural areas, grazed by domestic herbivores located in lowland, mountain, or marsh. One hundred and seventy-one horses older than a year pertaining to six farms and kept on 'parcours' were evaluated by a trained veterinarian using a modified version of the second level Animal Welfare Indicators (AWIN) welfare assessment protocol for horses. No major welfare issues were detected. Horses in 'parcours' displayed few abnormal behaviours, they could move freely for most of the day and interact with conspecifics, maintaining a healthy state of nutrition and a good relationship with humans. The main welfare concerns were related to the presence of superficial integument alterations such as alopecia, difficulty in reaching quality controlled water sources and a lack of shelter. As the number of facilities involved in this study is relatively limited, further harmonised data collection should aim to enlarge the sample size and allow comparison with different outdoor group-housing conditions.

AB  - Western bean cutworm, Striacosta albicosta (Smith; Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a major pest of corn and dry beans in its historic and expanded ranges in the North American western Great Plains and Great Lakes Region, respectively. In corn, S. albicosta ear feeding damage can significantly reduce yield and introduce avenues for secondary fungal infections. Management practices currently rely on transgenic crops expressing effective Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein, of which only the VIP3A protein is effective against S. albicosta, and/or labor-intensive scouting and chemical control. However, limited research on biological control options for this critical pest has been conducted. This study identifies key trophic interactions between S. albicosta and predatory arthropods in corn fields. Field surveys identified a community of 21 predator taxa present in Nebraska corn fields where S. albicosta eggs and larvae were present. The most common taxa were as follows: Hippodamia convergens (Gu & eacute;rin-M & eacute;neville; Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Coleomegilla maculata (De Geer; Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Orius insidiosus (Say; Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), and green lacewings (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae). Additionally, molecular gut-content analysis via PCR confirmed the predation of S. albicosta by several well-known biological control agents, including H. convergens, O. insidiosus, C. maculata, and Chrysopidae larvae and adults. Coleomegilla maculata consumed more S. albicosta eggs and larvae than H. convergens in feeding trials, although egg consumption by C. maculata was unaffected by the presence of corn pollen, an important supplemental food for this species. Exploring the trophic interactions between S. albicosta and its predators will provide information necessary to improve conservation biological control for S. albicosta integrated pest management.

AB  - This study explored the relationships between sperm quality and the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD, and glutathione peroxidase, GPx) in sperm (S) and seminal plasma (SP) of Asian elephants, as well as the potential protective role of glutamine in semen extenders during chilled storage. In experiment 1, twenty ejaculates from 11 bulls were analyzed for percentages (%) of sperm motility (%MOT), viability (%VIA), and activities of SOD and GPx. A significant negative correlation was found between %VIA and SP-SOD (r = - 0.71), and positive correlations between %MOT and both S-GPx (r = 0.49) and SP-GPx (r = 0.57). Following these findings, glutamine, a precursor of glutathione and semen antioxidant was introduced in Experiment 2. Each ejaculate (in a total of 8 ejaculates obtained from four bulls) was diluted in Tris-fructose(EYT) and Tris-glucose-egg yolk extender (TCG), respectively, supplemented with 0 (control), 20 and 40 mM glutamine and stored at 4 degrees C. Sperm parameters including %MOT, %VIA, functional membrane integrity (% sHOST), and DNA integrity (%DNA) were assessed after 24 and 48 h of storage. Results demonstrated that glutamine did not significantly affect %VIA or %DNA. A significant reduction in %MOT was observed at 24 h, but 20 mM glutamine added in extenders reversed this decline at 48 h. A 40 mM addition of glutamine in TCG markedly reduced %sHOST at 24 h. In conclusion, SOD and GPx activities in the sperm and seminal plasma are indicative of sperm quality. During chilling, using a higher level of glutamine may damage the spermatozoa of Asian elephants.

AB  - The intestinal tract of herbivorous arthropods provides a microhabitat for a group of protistan and fungal endosymbionts known as trichomycetes. Many hosts are the aquatic immature stages of insects. One understudied group is mosquito larvae with only six trichomycete species reported from the mosquito gut, but Smittium culicis Manier and Zancudomyces culisetae Y. Wang, Tretter, Lichtw. & M.M. White are globally distributed and common in these insects. Mosquitoes are mostly found in standing freshwater habitats, but there are species that are found in brackish water pools common in salt marshes. No trichomycetes are reported from salt marsh mosquitoes. A new species, Legerioides culicicola, is described from mosquito larvae from freshwater sources in Nova Scotia (NS) and Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada, and Smittium gronthidium Strongman & M.M. White is reported for the first time in this host. Smittium culicis is reported from salt marsh mosquitoes from collections in the same provinces in Eastern Canada. Information on the prevalence of mosquito trichomycetes is presented for sites in NS and PEI.

AB  - Animal sociality emerges from individual decisions on how to balance the costs and benefits of being sociable. Novel pathogens introduced into wildlife populations should increase the costs of sociality, selecting against gregariousness. Using an individual-based model that captures essential features of pathogen transmission among social hosts, we show how novel pathogen introduction provokes the rapid evolutionary emergence and coexistence of distinct social movement strategies. These strategies differ in how they trade the benefits of social information against the risk of infection. Overall, pathogen-risk-adapted populations move more and have fewer associations with other individuals than their pathogen-risk-naive ancestors, reducing disease spread. Host evolution to be less social can be sufficient to cause a pathogen to be eliminated from a population, which is followed by a rapid recovery in social tendency. Our conceptual model is broadly applicable to a wide range of potential host-pathogen introductions and offers initial predictions for the eco-evolutionary consequences of wildlife pathogen spillover scenarios and a template for the development of theory in the ecology and evolution of animals' movement decisions.

AB  - Introduction: Cognitive Map Theory predicts that the hippocampus (HPC) plays a specialized, time -invariant role in supporting allocentric spatial memory, while Standard Consolidation Theory makes the competing prediction that the HPC plays a time -limited role, with more remote memories gaining independence of HPC function. These theories, however, are largely informed by the results of laboratory -based tests that are unlikely to simulate the demands of representing real -world environments in humans. Validation of these theories is further limited by an overall focus on spatial memory of newly encountered environments and on individuals with extensive lesions to the HPC and to surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions. The current study incorporates naturalistic tests of spatial memory based on recently and remotely encountered environments navigated by individuals with lesions to the HPC/MTL or that are limited to the HPC's major output, the fornix. Methods: Four participants with bilateral HPC/MTL and/or fornix lesions drew sketch maps of recently and remotely experienced neighbourhoods and houses. Tests of the appearance, distances, and routes between landmarks from the same real -world environments were also administered. Performance on the tasks was compared to that of control participants closely matched in terms of exposure to the same neighbourhoods and home environments as well as to actual maps. Results: The performance of individuals with fornix/MTL lesions was found to be largely comparable to that of controls on objective tests of spatial memory, other than one case who was impaired on remote and recent conditions for several tasks. The nature of deficits in recent and remote spatial memory were further revealed on house floorplan drawings, which contained spatial distortions, room/structure transpositions, and omissions, and on neighbourhood sketch maps, which were intact in terms of overall layout but sparse in details such as landmarks. Conclusion: Lab -based tests of spatial memory of newly learned environments are unlikely to fully capture patterns of spared and impaired representations of real -world environments (e.g., peripheral features, configurations). Naturalistic tasks, including generative drawing tasks, indicate that contrary to Cognitive Map Theory, neither HPC nor MTL are critical for allocentric gross representations of large-scale environments. Conversely, the HPC appears critical for representing detailed spatial information of local naturalistic environments and environmental objects regardless of the age of the memory, contrary to Standard Consolidation Theory.

AB  - Introduction Early brain injury (EBI) plays a key role in the devastating outcomes after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Autophagy and apoptosis may share a common molecular inducer that regulates the process of cell death. FoxO1, as a key regulator of neuronal autophagy which is involved in apoptosis, has not been reported in SAH rats. This work was to investigate the protective and anti-inflammatory effects of FoxO1 on EBI after SAH by regulating autophagy. Methods In this study, we constructed the SAH model. In experiment I, low dose (50 mu l of 1 x 10(8) IU/ml) or high dose (50 mu l of 1 x 10(10) IU/ml) of FoxO1 gene overexpressed adenovirus vector was injected into the lateral ventricle of rats before SAH. In experiment II, we reported the effect of FoxO1 overexpress on nerve function recovery, oedema, BBB leakage, neuronal death in rats after SAH through autophagy regulation. Post-SAH evaluation included neurological function score, brain water content, evans blue exosmosis, pathological changes, inflammatory response and apoptosis. Results The experiment I showed that either low or high dose of ad-FoxO1 could significantly improve nerve function, reduce cerebral water content and reduce blood-brain barrier (BBB) destruction in rats, indicating that ad-FoxO1 had a protective effect on brain injury in rats EBI after SAH. In addition, ad-FoxO1 promoted autophagy in rat hippocampal tissue, as evidenced by accumulation of LC3II/I and Beclin-1 and degradation of p62. Furthermore, ad-FoxO1 inhibited the inflammatory response and apoptosis of rat hippocampal neurons after SAH. The experiment II showed that both ad-FoxO1 and rapamycin attenuated the injury of nerve function in rats after SAH, and this synergistic effect further reduced cerebral edema and evansblue extravasation, decreased hippocampus neuronal cell apoptosis, and declined inflammatory response. However, this was contrary to the results of chloroquine. These findings suggested that FoxO1 regulated the neural function of EBI after SAH through the autophagy pathway. Conclusions The findings in this study was beneficial for identifying the novel therapeutic target for the treatment of SAH.

AB  - Simple Summary The Sanmartinero creole bovine (SM) is found in the department of Meta (Colombian Orinoquia) and derives from the bullfighting cattle introduced by the Spanish in the 15th century. Its adaptation process has allowed it to develop adaptive characteristics to live in extreme climatic environments. Although there are studies on its reproductive and productive characteristics, little is known about possible asymmetries in some biological structures. Fluctuating asymmetry allows us to detect a possible developmental instability that may be caused by stressful conditions. The aim of our study was to present the current state of developmental instability in two bilateral cephalic characters of the SM creole bovine. The results showed a fluctuating asymmetry biased to the left for ear and horn length, and to the right for ear width and horn perimeter. We consider that the environment in which it lives may have an impact on the development of cephalic structures, creating stress in the animal, which causes the detected asymmetry. However, the authors are not aware of any studies on this topic.Abstract Asymmetric studies can indicate disturbances in the developmental process. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is considered an indicator of stress. The Sanmartinero (SM) creole bovine is native to the department of Meta (Colombian Orinoquia) and its adaptation process has allowed it to live in extreme tropical environments. The aim of this cross-sectional and descriptive study was to present the current state of the knowledge of asymmetries in some cephalic characters of the SM creole bovine. A total of 94 animals were studied (18 uncastrated males and 76 females) from three different farms, with an age range of 0.5-10 years. For each animal, two measurements of the ear (width and length) and two measurements of the horn (perimeter and length) were obtained in vivo. The degree of asymmetry was calculated as (R - L)/(R + L). Bilateral differences pointed towards a fluctuating asymmetry (e.g., a random variation in the trait that is expected to be perfectly symmetrical) biased towards right for ear width and horn perimeter, and towards left for ear and horn length. Since the development of these structures-ears and horns-is under the control of the same set of genes, the fluctuating asymmetry could constitute a reflection of a normal condition.

AB  - ObjectiveSmall angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis is a sensitive way of determining the ultrastructure of collagen in tissues. Little is known about how parameters measured by SAXS are affected by preservatives commonly used to prevent autolysis. We determined the effects of formalin, glutaraldehyde, Triton X and saline on measurements of fibril diameter, fibril diameter distribution, and D-spacing of corneal collagen using SAXS analysis.ResultsCompared to sections of sheep and cats' corneas stored frozen as controls, those preserved in 5% glutaraldehyde and 10% formalin had significantly larger mean collagen fibril diameters, increased fibril diameter distribution and decreased D-spacing. Sections of corneas preserved in Triton X had significantly increased collagen fibril diameters and decreased fibril diameter distribution. Those preserved in 0.9% saline had significantly increased mean collagen fibril diameters and decreased diameter distributions. Subjectively, the corneas preserved in 5% glutaraldehyde and 10% formalin maintained their transparency but those in Triton X and 0.9% saline became opaque. Subjective morphological assessment of transmission electron microscope images of corneas supported the SAXS data. Workers using SAXS analysis to characterize collagen should be alerted to changes that can be introduced by common preservatives in which their samples may have been stored.

The promoted fission gas retention is thought to improve the performance of the fuel at high burnup. In this work, we review models for the solubility of chromium in UO2, 2 , and the evolution of the chromium phases in the fuel matrix during irradiation. These models are implemented in SCIANTIX, an open- source mesoscale code describing inert gas behaviour in nuclear fuel. We adjusted the chromium solubility model keeping each parameter within its range of compatibility with experimental data, targeting a better representation of available electron probe microanalysis data of chromium content in fuel after irradiation. As for fission gas behaviour, we considered a physics-based description of the chromium impact on the fission gas diffusivity in fuel grains. The expression for the fission gas diffusivity in standard non-doped uranium oxide has been extended by introducing the impact of the concentration of defects introduced by interstitial oxygen excess representing the effect of chromium content in the fuel itself. A preliminary integral assessment of the proposed models has been carried out against the available experimental data.

AB  - Despite tea [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze] is one of the top non-alcoholic beverages consumed around the world; its genetic and phenotypic diversity is less understood compared to other plantation crops. The study's aims were to undertake phenotypic and genotypic characterization of Sri Lankan and Indian tea germplasm and to identify diverse accessions to accelerate tea breeding programmes in both countries. A total of 171 tea accessions, comprising 94 Sri Lankan and 77 Indian accessions were used. All the accessions were subjected to phenotyping and genotyping using 28 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Based on 16 morphological characters, the first three principal components explained 57.61% and 58.43% of the total variability of Sri Lankan and Indian accessions, respectively. Young shoot pubescence, young shoot pigmentation, serration of leaf margin, and mature leaf colour contributed positively to the grouping of accessions. Based on Neighbor-joining analysis, all Sri Lankan accessions grouped in a single cluster, whereas Indian accessions grouped in two distinct clusters. The Gower's distance method was the most appropriate than other methods for developing core subsets. Among 21 Sri Lankan core accessions selected, 11 accessions belong to introductions, five TRI-developed cultivars and five estate selections. Among 18 Indian core accessions selected, 11 belong to China types, two Assam types and five Indian recommended cultivars. The current study is the first study to compare tea germplasm of both countries and the results are useful for tea crop improvement programme, conservation and utilization of tea germplasm in India and Sri Lanka in the future.

AB  - (1) Introduction: Simultaneous ECMO and IABP therapy is frequently used. Haemodynamic changes responsible for the success of the concomitant mechanical circulatory support system approach are rarely investigated. In a large-animal model, we analysed haemodynamic parameters before and during ECMO therapy, comparing central and peripheral ECMO circulation with and without simultaneous IABP support. (2) Methods: Thirty-three female pigs were divided into five groups: (1) SHAM, (2) (peripheral)ECMO(-)IABP, (3) (p)ECMO(+)IABP, (4) (central)ECMO(-)IABP, and (5) (c)ECMO(+)IABP. Pigs were cannulated in accordance with the group and supported with ECMO (+/- IABP) for 10 h. Systemic haemodynamics, cardiac index (CI), and coronary and carotid artery blood flow were determined before, directly after, and at five and ten hours on extracorporeal support. Systemic inflammation (IL-6; IL-10; TNF alpha; IFN gamma), immune response (NETs; cf-DNA), and endothelial injury (ET-1) were also measured. (3) Results: IABP support during antegrade ECMO circulation led to a significant reduction of left ventricular pressure in comparison to retrograde flow in (p)ECMO(-)IABP and (p)ECMO(+)IABP. Blood flow in the left anterior coronary and carotid artery was not affected by extracorporeal circulation. (4) Conclusions: Concomitant central ECMO and IABP therapy leads to significant reduction of intracavitary cardiac pressure, reduces cardiac work, and might therefore contribute to improved recovery in ECMO patients.

AB  - IntroductionAmenorrhea induced decrease of hormones is associated with cognitive impairment. This study aimed to evaluate hippocampal functional connectivity patterns in chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea (CIA) breast cancer (BC) patients, to evaluate the relationship between the functional connectivity features and hormone levels. MethodNeuropsychological test, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and assessment of hormone levels were conducted in 21 premenopausal BC patients before chemotherapy (t(0)) and 1 week after completing chemotherapy (t(1)). Twenty matched healthy controls (HC) were also included and underwent the same assessments at similar time intervals. Mixed effect analysis and paired t-test were used to compare differences in brain functional connectivity. ResultsVoxel-based paired t-tests revealed increased functional connectivity of the right and left hippocampus with the left fusiform gyrus, inferior and middle temporal gyrus, inferior occipital gyrus, left lingual gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus after chemotherapy (p < .001) in CIA patients. Repeated measures analysis revealed significant group-by-time interactions in the left hippocampus with the bilateral fusiform gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, and left inferior occipital gyrus (p < .001). Premenopausal BC patients had no significant differences in cognitive function compared with HC at baseline. However, the CIA patients had high levels of self-rating depression scale, self-rating anxiety scale, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. Further, the CIA patients showed significant differences in hormone and fasting plasma glucose levels and cognitive performances between t(0) and t(1) (p < .05). Functional connectivity changes between the left hippocampus and the left inferior occipital gyrus was negatively correlated with E2 and luteinizing hormone changes (p < .05). ConclusionThe CIA patients had cognitive dysfunction mainly in memory and visual mobility. Chemotherapy may affect hippocampal-posterior cortical circuit which mediates visual processing in CIA patients. Moreover, E2 may be involved in this process.

AB  - Simple Summary In order to better understand the ecological niche of the Italian hare, we evaluated the diet selection of the species in two protected areas of the Latium coastal environment. The main results emerging from our study were: the wide feeding spectrum of the Italian hare; the high incidence of grasses in dry and in wet season diets; the low number of plant species ingested at relatively high rates; the plastic feeding behaviour of this hare, as diet preferences changed with the variety and abundance of food species. These results highlighted the great adaptability of the species to different niches and the influence of the floristic composition on its feeding habits. In the Italian hare, the assessment of habitat suitability is of strategic importance for its conservation. In particular, feeding preferences of the species may lead to defining some food items as key plant species for identifying its elective habitat and, hence, planning effective re-introduction initiatives. This study was focused on the diet and feeding behaviour of Lepus corsicanus in two protected coastal areas of Latium, Castelporziano Presidential Estate (CPE) and Circeo National Park (CNP). Plant frequency was assessed by the quadrat method, while diet composition was determined by microhistological analysis of faecal samples. Over the year, the Italian hare fed on 185 of the 229 plant species identified in vegetation, with most of them ingested in low percentages (<= 1%). During the dry season (DS), in both areas, Brachypodium sylvaticum, Cynodon dactylon, and Avena fatua were among the most consumed species. In the wet season (WS) the most common plant species in diet were B. sylvaticum, Poa trivialis, and Carex distachya in CPE and Dactylis glomerata, Cynosurus echinatus, and Spartium junceum in CNP. In both sites, considering the annual selection of life forms, grasses and leguminous forbs were preferred, while non-leguminous forbs and shrubs were used less than expected according to their availability. ANOSIM analysis showed significant differences between sites in DS and WS diets. Our study evidenced that the Italian hare behaved as generalist, revealing its capability for exploiting several plant species and to adapt its diet preferences to space-time variation of food availability.

AB  - Introduction: Prenatal infections are associated with an increased risk of the onset of schizophrenia. Rodent models of maternal immune stimulation (MIS) have been extensively used in preclinical studies. However, many of these studies only include males, omitting pathophysiological features unique to females. The aim of this study is to characterize the MIS model in female rats using positron emission tomography (PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (MR), and neuroplasticiy studies.Methods: In gestational day 15, Poly I:C (or Saline) was injected into pregnant Wistar rats to induce the MIS model. Imaging studies: [F-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET scans of female-offspring were acquired at post-natal day (PND) 35 and PND100. Furthermore, T2-MR brain images were acquired in adulthood. Differences in FDG uptake and morphometry between groups were assessed with SPM12 and Regions of Interest (ROI) analyses. Ex vivo study: The density of parvalbumin expressing interneurons (PV), perineuronal nets (PNN), and parvalbumin expressing interneurons surrounded by perineuronal nets (PV-PNN) were evaluated in the prelimbic cortex and basolateral amygdala using confocal microscopy. ROIs and neuroplasticity data were analyzed by 2-sample T-test and 2-way-ANOVA analyses, respectively.Results: A significant increase in brain metabolism was found in all animals at adulthood compared to adolescence. MIS hardly modified brain glucose metabolism in females, highlighting a significant hypometabolism in the thalamus at adulthood. In addition, MIS induced gray matter (GM) enlargements in the pituitary, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and cingulate cortex, and GM shrinkages in some thalamic nuclei, cerebelar areas, and brainstem. Moreover, MIS induced white matter shrinkages in the cerebellum, brainstem and corpus callosum, along with cerebrospinal fluid enlargements in the lateral and 4th ventricles. Finally, MIS reduced the density of PV, PNN, and PV-PNN in the basolateral amygdala.Conclusion: Our work showed in vivo the differential pattern of functional and morphometric affectation in the MIS model in females, as well as the deficits caused at the synaptic level according to sex. The differences obtained highlight the relevance of including both sexes in psychiatric research in order to consider their pathophysiological particularities and successfully extend the benefits obtained to the entire patient population.

AB  - Thyme has strong antioxidant properties and, therefore, can reduce the intensity of oxidative processes taking place in the body. The study aimed to assess whether the addition of thyme to diets for fattening pigs containing extruded flaxseeds, a source of n-3 PUFAs, which are particularly susceptible to oxidation, would have a positive effect on redox status and lipid metabolism. The experiment was conducted using 120 weaners (WBP x Neckar crosses) of about 30 kg BW, which were kept until the end of fattening (about 110 kg BW) and divided into three groups of 40 pigs. The control group received a diet with 4% extruded flaxseed. In groups T1 and T3, 1% or 3% of thyme was added to the basal diet. The introduction of 3% thyme resulted in a decrease in the total cholesterol level in the blood and the loin muscle. Moreover, an increase in SOD and CAT activity and a decrease in FRAP and LOOH was noted. Following supplementation with 3% thyme, the n-3 PUFA content and n-3/n-6 ratio increased, while the SFA content was significantly reduced. The results of the studies indicate that thyme has a positive effect on the redox status and lipid profile of the blood and muscles.

AB  - Genomic prediction is a crucial technique for phenotype estimation, with the genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) being the most widely adopted method. Yet, GBLUP falls short in capturing the intricate nonlinear relationships between genomic data and phenotypes. Given its ability to more effectively capture nonlinear genetic effects, machine learning (ML) has become increasingly appealing in genomic prediction. However, almost GBLUP and ML methods utilize all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data for prediction, ignoring the fact that only a subset of SNPs are effective. This not only consumes computation time but also has poor prediction accuracy. So, this paper proposed a mutual information stacking method (MISM). Firstly, mutual information was introduced to select the SNPs with effect and remove the redundant SNPs. Then, we constructed a stacking model that can capture both linear and nonlinear relationships between SNPs and phenotypes to improve the prediction accuracy. To assess the effectiveness of MISM, we compared its performance on pig growth traits with GBLUP and other ML methods. The statistical analysis results indicated that MISM outperformed other ML models and GBLUP.

AB  - Early detection and timely intervention of isolated piglet outliers are crucial in promptly identifying potential illnesses and ensuring animal welfare. This study proposes a comprehensive framework, Multi-Object Tracking Isolated Outlier Detection (MOTIOD), to identify persistent isolated piglet outliers in complex pig farm environments. The framework consists of a multi-object tracking (MOT) module and an outlier detection module. The MOT module, employing a transformer-based TransTrack approach, develops dark region-adaptive IoU (Intersection over Union) matching strategy and piglet ID constraint allocation strategy to address common challenges in pig farms, such as variable lighting conditions and occlusions. The outlier detection module presents a novel Spatiotemporal Dynamics-Based Outlier Detection (SD-OD) algorithm, which considers the duration of isolated outlier behaviour and the spatial information of piglet interactions with their sow and littermates. Experimental results validate the MOTIOD framework demonstrates significant performance in low visibility continuous tracking, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as Yolov5s+DeepSORT and CenterTrack with a MOTA of 98.8 % and an IDF1 of 99.0 %, and effectively identifies isolated outliers with a 92.9 % precision rate in outlier detection. This research introduces a valuable approach for the early identification of potential health risks in piglets, enhancing the proactive management of livestock health, and potentially contributing to the sustainable advancement of precision livestock farming.

AB  - Since their introduction in Colombia in the '80s for Pablo Escobar's extravagant zoo, hippos have become an ecological problem around the basin of the Magdalena River. This article proposes an ecosemiotic discourse analysis of different visions of nature enacted by stakeholders and public opinion around the management of hippos in Colombia. Concretely, we focus on three particular discourses and visions of nature: animalista, narco-cultural, and conservacionista. In this article, we present the relevant social and ecological context of Colombia, the visions of nature theory and the impact of such visions on conservation measures regarding so-called invasive species; we describe and analyze the three visions of nature we center on, and present a computational analysis of discourse dynamics and controversies in Twitter between of such visions of nature; and we reflect on possible courses of action and recommendations about addressing the close interrelation of public discourses and ecosystem conservation by proposing an alternative view, based on the biosemiotic framework of semiocide, to the concept of invasive species.

AB  - IntroductionNeonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) is a serious inflammatory injury. At present, the standard treatment for this disease is hypothermia therapy, and the effect of drug intervention is still limited. L-F001 is a compound of fasudil and lipoic acid. Previous in vitro experiments have confirmed that L-F001 has anti-inflammatory neuroprotective functions. However, its therapeutic effect on neonates with HIBD remains unknown. This study was aimed at exploring the therapeutic effect of L-F001 on HIBD rats.MethodsThe newborn rats were divided into three groups: Sham operation group, HIBD group, and HIBD + L-F001 group. HE staining, Nissil staining, the immunofluorescence of iNOS and COX-2, ELISA (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10), and western blotting analyses were performed to determine the therapeutic effect of L-F001. Finally, we evaluated the growth and development of each group by measuring body weight.ResultsThe hippocampal structure of HIBD rats was disordered, and the Nissil body was small and shallow. The expressions of iNOS and COX-2 in HIBD rats were increased, whereas the expressions of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in plasma were upregulated, and the expression of IL-10 was decreased. L-F001 could improve the tissue structure and reduce the expression of iNOS and COX-2 in HIBD rats. Meanwhile, L-F001 could also reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and restore the content of anti-inflammatory cytokines in plasma. We further found that the TLR4 pathway was activated after hypoxic-ischemia in neonatal rats. L-F001 could inhibit the activation of TLR4 pathway. Finally, we found that after L-F001 treatment, the body weight of HIBD rats increased significantly compared with the untreated group.ConclusionsL-F001 antagonizes the inflammatory response after hypoxic-ischemia by inhibiting the activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway, thus playing a neuroprotective role. L-F001 may be a potential therapeutic agent for neonatal HIBD.

AB  - Psychostimulant addiction is a chronic brain disorder with high relapse rates, requiring new therapeutic strategies. The orexin system is highly implicated in processing reward and addiction through connections with critical areas such as the hippocampus. This study investigated the role of orexin-1 receptors (OX1R) within the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus in the extinction and reinstatement of the methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference. After cannulae implantation, recovery, and establishing the methamphetamine place preference, 98 male Wistar rats received different doses of bilateral intra-CA1 selective OX1R antagonist, SB334867 (1, 3, 10, and 30 nmol/0.5 mu l DMSO per side) during the 10-day extinction period (daily) or after extinction phase, just on the reinstatement day (single dose) in separate experimental and control groups. The findings indicated that bilateral microinjection of SB334867 into the CA1 area during the extinction period could significantly reduce the extinction latency and maintenance of rewarding aspects of methamphetamine dose-dependently (3, 10, and 30 nmol). In another set of experiments, a single dose of bilateral intra-CA1 SB334867 administration on the reinstatement phase prevented the methamphetamine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behaviors at the high doses (10, and 30 nmol). The present study provided more evidence for the implication of hippocampal OX1R in the maintenance of rewarding and reinforcing properties of methamphetamine and its role in the relapse of methamphetamine-seeking behavior. Further investigations on the role of the orexin system, including the orexin-2 receptors in treating addiction, are needed to introduce its antagonists as effective therapeutic options for psychostimulant addiction.

AB  - Simple Summary The well-being and welfare of animals on farms is a topic of interest to many people. On the island of Ireland, this issue has received increased attention because of political and governance changes, including Brexit and COVID-19. Policy-makers and industry are considering labelling schemes to inform the food consumer about welfare standards on farms. Focus groups and an online survey were carried out with members of the public on the island of Ireland to explore their awareness, perceptions, and attitudes toward farm animal welfare standards on farms in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Most consumers believed farm animal welfare standards were high, although different farming sectors were rated differently: beef and dairy farms were viewed more positively, and pig and poultry farms were viewed less positively. The living conditions of the animal, size and intensity of the farm, national standards and schemes, and visibility all influenced perceptions of welfare standards. The public also expressed a lack of knowledge and information on the topic. In developing new policies and labelling schemes, it is important to be apprised of the current awareness, attitudes, and perceptions that the public has regarding farm animal welfare standards, as identified in the current paper. There has been increased public interest and concerns in issues such as farm animal welfare (FAW) on the island of Ireland, stoked in part by political and governance changes, such as Brexit and COVID-19. Front-of-pack food labelling represents a primary information channel for many people. In advance of considering formalised food labelling schemes, specifically relating to FAW, it is important to ensure an up-to-date understanding of current consumer perceptions of FAW. With this aim, the current study utilised a mixed methodology. Nine focus group discussions (n = 41) and an online survey (n = 972) with food consumers in Ireland and Northern Ireland explored perceptions of FAW. Results suggest that overall perceptions of FAW are high, and consumers perceive FAW to have improved in the last decade. Quantitative (ANOVA) and qualitative results show variations in perception of FAW between sectors. Results from the focus group discussions identified factors underlying consumers' perception of FAW: the living conditions of the animal, size and intensity of the farm, national standards and schemes, and visibility. Information insufficiencies and knowledge gaps were identified. The findings are discussed in relation to policy implications for the role of public engagement, front-of-pack welfare labelling, and quality assurance schemes.

AB  - Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a model species for studying fruit development, wounding, herbivory, and pathogen attack. Despite tomato's world-wide economic importance and the role of chloroplasts as metabolic hubs and integrators of environmental cues, little is known about the stromal proteome of tomato. Using a high-yielding protocol for chloroplast and stromal protein isolation, MudPIT nano-LC-MS/MS analyses, a robust in-house protein database (the Atlas) for predicting the plastid localization of tomato proteins, and rigorous selection criteria for inclusion/exclusion in the stromal proteome, we identified 1,278 proteins of the tomato stromal proteome. We provide one of the most robust stromal proteomes available to date with empirical evidence for 545 and 92 proteins not previously described for tomato plastids and the Arabidopsis stroma, respectively. The relative abundance of tomato stromal proteins was determined using the exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI). Comparison of the abundance of tomato and Arabidopsis stromal proteomes provided evidence for the species-specific nature of stromal protein homeostasis. The manual curation of the tomato stromal proteome classified proteins into ten functional categories resulting in an accessible compendium of tomato chloroplast proteins. After curation, only 91 proteins remained as unknown, uncharacterized or as enzymes with unknown functions. The curation of the tomato stromal proteins also indicated that tomato has a number of paralogous proteins, not present in Arabidopsis, which accumulated to different levels in chloroplasts. As some of these proteins function in key metabolic pathways or in perceiving or transmitting signals critical for plant adaptation to biotic and abiotic stress, these data suggest that tomato may modulate the bidirectional communication between chloroplasts and nuclei in a novel manner. The stromal proteome provides a fertile ground for future mechanistic studies in the field of tomato chloroplast-nuclear signaling and are foundational for our goal of elucidating the dynamics of the stromal proteome controlled by the solanaceous-specific, stromal, and wound-inducible leucine aminopeptidase A of tomato.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) visual tracking has always been a challenging task. Existing correlation filter tracking algorithms typically utilize the histograms of oriented gradients (HOGs) and color names (CNs) method to directly incorporate the extracted target features into the model updating process. However, low-resolution (LR) video quality leads to unstable target feature values. To address this limitation, we propose a novel preprocessing technique involving Gaussian denoising. This preprocessing step is designed to enhance the stability of the target's feature values and make the target's scale information clearer, thereby improving the tracker's recognition capability for the target and effectively reducing noise interference. Furthermore, in contrast to other UAV trackers that rely on a singular representation of contextual information, this article aims to enhance the utilization of historical information. Therefore, we introduce a context-based approach that integrates continuously weighted dynamic response maps from both temporal and spatial perspectives. Our tracker has the ability to adapt to rapid environmental changes during the tracking process while simultaneously reducing the potential risks of model overfitting and distortion. Extensive experiments are conducted on authoritative datasets, including DTB70, UAV123@10fps, and UAVDT, comparing our model against other advanced trackers. The experimental results validate the superior tracking performance and robustness of our tracker.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Reproductive management of sheep for autumnal lambing often require induction and synchronization of oestrus and ovulation, either for natural mating or artificial insemination, by the use of pharmacological treatments. Such treatments are mostly based on the administration of progesterone followed by a single intramuscular dose of equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) at progesterone withdrawal. However, repeated eCG treatments in consecutive mating seasons can result in the outbreak of resistance with a rise of anti-eCG antibodies. Furthermore, the future use and availability of eCG appears to be strongly challenged by the highly active animal-rights movement because the hormone is obtained from pregnant mares. The present study demonstrated that the administration of glycerol-based formulations to milked ewes is a valid alternative to eCG treatment in reproductive management protocols based on the induction of ovulation with progesterone-releasing devices at the end of anoestrus period. The glucogenic treatment administration to late lactation dairy ewes at the end of the anoestrus period improved their metabolism without harming animal production or animal welfare, thus promoting a sustainable reproductive management of dairy sheep.
   This study investigated whether the administration of equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) in a protocol to induce and synchronize ovulations before mating could be replaced by the administration of glycerol-based formulations in milked ewes at the end of their seasonal anoestrus. Forty-eight late-lactation dairy ewes of the Sarda breed were synchronized using sponges impregnated with progestogen and then joined with fertile rams (day (D) 0, ram introduction). From D-4 to D-1, the ewes received by gavage either 100 mL of a glucogenic mixture (70% glycerol, 20% propylene glycol and 10% water; GLU group; n = 24) or 100 mL of water (GON group; n = 24) twice daily. Moreover, on the day of sponge withdrawal (D-1), GON ewes received 200 IU of eCG. There were no differences in reproductive performances between groups. GLU ewes showed higher glycemia (p < 0.001), insulinemia (p < 0.05), plasma glycerol (p < 0.001), triglycerides (p < 0.001) and lower cholesterol (p < 0.001), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA; p < 0.05) and urea (p < 0.001). Plasma osmolality was higher in GLU but only 4 h after dosing (p < 0.001). Milk yield and milk composition were not affected by the treatments with exception of milk glycerol (p < 0.001) and milk urea (p < 0.001), which were higher and lower in GLU than GON ewes, respectively. In conclusion, the administration of the glucogenic mixture to late lactation dairy ewes at the end of anoestrus period resulted in reproductive responses as good as the ones obtained by the eCG treatment, suggesting that the objective of a sustainable reproductive management of dairy sheep can be successfully pursued.

AB  - Selective therapeutic targeting of cardiomyocytes (CMs) and non-myocytes (NMs) within the heart is an active field of research. The success of those novel therapeutic strategies is linked to the ability to accurately assess uptake and gene delivery efficiencies in clinically relevant animal models. Nevertheless, quantification at the single cell level remains a significant challenge. While flow cytometry offers the possibility of an accurate and direct single-cell quantification, the unique structural and physical properties of CMs complicate the analysis. There are no standardized methods reported for the flow cytometry analysis of adult CMs, which is a significant pitfall in the field. Here, we address this gap and introduce a robust and optimized method for the successful flow cytometry analysis of isolated CMs. Starting from tissue digestion, we present a simple workflow for the isolation and characterization of CMs and NMs, tested and validated for pig and mouse. We demonstrate the versatility of this method through three biologically relevant applications. First, we introduce a model to quantify CMs nucleation based on DNA content distribution. Second, we assess cell-specific in vivo gene delivery with AAV-Luc in pig hearts. And last, we demonstrate how structural remodeling of CMs affects their light scattering properties, in a pressure overload-induced hypertrophy mouse model. Together, these findings establish a flexible and quantitative platform for single-cell analysis of cardiac cell populations in both basic and translational cardiovascular research.

AB  - Translocation programs are commonly undertaken to conserve threatened species, but loss of animals to predation after release remains a significant challenge. Feral cats (Felis catus) are a major predator of many native Australian mammals and a significant contributor to translocation failure in this group. However, identifying cat predation as the cause of mortality in the field is challenging and can hinder or delay the implementation of appropriate management actions. We compared field and genetic data collected from 92 cat predation events that occurred during native mammal translocations in South Australia. Our study found that necropsy and genetic evidence obtained through DNA analysis were the most reliable methods for identifying feral cat predation. Field evidence such as cat tracks, scats or collar bite marks were recorded infrequently and inconsistently. Relying solely on field evidence will significantly underestimate predation by feral cats on translocated species and even DNA evidence was found to underestimate impact. We demonstrated the value of intensively monitoring translocated animals post-release so as to facilitate prompt collection of multiple lines of evidence such as necropsy, field evidence and reliable DNA samples. An absence of field evidence should not be used to discount cat predation as a potential cause of mortality in translocation programs.

AB  - Simple Summary The choice of the optimal sperm preservation method is an important consideration in animal breeding. Stored semen can be used for reproductive purposes to introduce new genotypes and prevent inbreeding, which poses a considerable problem in cervid farms. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effect of storage time and storage method (liquid state/epididymides) on the motility, morphology, and antioxidant status of European red deer sperm stored at 5 degrees C for up to six days (D0-D6). Sperm samples were assessed for motility, viability, morphology, activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD; glutathione peroxidase, GPx; catalase, CAT), and lipid peroxidation (based on malondialdehyde, MDA, content). Significant differences between storage variants were noted on D2 in sperm morphology; on D4 in the percentage of progressively motile sperm, MDA content, and SOD and GPx activity; and on D6 in the percentage of motile and viable spermatozoa. Sperm motility, viability, and antioxidant status are more effectively preserved during liquid storage than epididymal storage. Morphological and functional abnormalities of sperm were observed earlier during epididymal storage, which suggests that spermatozoa can be stored for shorter periods of time in the epididymides than in a liquid state.Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the motility, morphology, and antioxidant status of European red deer sperm stored in a liquid state (variant I) and in the epididymides (variant II). Spermatozoa were harvested post-mortem from the cauda epididymis. Sperm samples in both variants were stored for up to six days (D6) at 5 degrees C. Spermatozoa were assessed for motility, viability, morphology, activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD; glutathione peroxidase, GPx; catalase, CAT), and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA, content). Sperm samples were analyzed on storage days 0, 2, 4, and 6 (D0-D6). Storage time and storage method significantly (p <= 0.05) influenced the examined variables. On D2, a decrease in motility and acrosomal integrity was observed in both storage variants, whereas a decrease in viability and an increase in MDA content were noted in spermatozoa stored in the epididymides. On D4, higher values of SOD and GPx activity and MDA content were noted in variant I than in variant II. Catalase activity was very low. GPx is the key enzyme that participates in the reduction of hydrogen peroxide in sperm cells. Spermatozoa stored in a liquid state were characterized by higher motility and viability, improved morphology and antioxidant status than those stored in the epididymides; therefore, liquid storage is more recommended for short-term preservation of epididymal spermatozoa.

AB  - The efficient management and utilization of coal mine equipment maintenance knowledge is an indispensable foundation for advancing the establishment of intelligent mines. This knowledge has problems such as scattered, low sharing, and insufficient management, which restricts the development of coal mine intelligence. For the above-mentioned problems, a large language model for the maintenance of coal mine equipment based on multi-source text (XCoalChat) was proposed to better manage and utilize the existing massive knowledge of coal mine equipment maintenance. The dataset of coal mine equipment maintenance based on ReliableCEMK-Self-Instruction was constructed to obtain a wide and diverse amount of knowledge through sample generation. Aiming at the illusory problem of the large language model, a knowledge graph enhancement method based on the "Coal Mine Equipment Maintenance System-Full Life Cycle-Specification" was proposed to improve the knowledge density. A triple-LoRA fine-tuning mechanism and DPO direct preference optimization method were introduced into the top of the baseline model, which guarantees that XCoalChat can handle multiple Q&A and maintenance decision analysis tasks with limited computing power. Compared with ChatGLM, Bloom, and LLama, the comprehensive assessment of XCoalChat was performed by experiments including coal mine dialog consulting, coal mine professional consulting, and maintenance decision analysis. The results showed that XCoalChat achieved the best response accuracy in professional consulting and maintenance decision analysis; XCoalChat also took the least reasoning time on average. XCoalChat outperformed other mainstream large language models, which verify that XCoalChat is an effective large language model in the field of coal mine equipment maintenance.

AB  - Real-time target detection plays an important role in campus intelligent surveillance systems. This paper introduces Soft-NMS, GSConv, Triplet Attention, and other advanced technologies to propose a lightweight pedestrian and vehicle detection model named SGST-YOLOv8. In this paper, the improved YOLOv8 model is trained on the self-made dataset, and the tracking algorithm is combined to achieve an accurate and efficient real-time pedestrian and vehicle tracking detection system. The improved model achieved an accuracy of 88.6%, which is 1.2% higher than the baseline model YOLOv8. Additionally, the mAP0.5:0.95 increased by 3.2%. The model parameters and GFLOPS reduced by 5.6% and 7.9%, respectively. In addition, this study also employed the improved YOLOv8 model combined with the bot sort tracking algorithm on the website for actual detection. The results showed that the improved model achieves higher FPS than the baseline YOLOv8 model when detecting the same scenes, with an average increase of 3-5 frames per second. The above results verify the effectiveness of the improved model for real-time target detection in complex environments.

AB  - IntroductionDisrupted sleep has been consistently linked with lower academic achievement and worse mental health in children. Less is understood about sleep as a potential factor underlying socioeconomic differences in brain morphometry in children. The goals of this study were to investigate the associations among socioeconomic factors, sleep duration, and brain morphometry in children, and to examine the roles of the sleep environment and family routines in these associations. MethodsParticipants were 5- to 9-year-old children from socioeconomically diverse families (N = 94; 61% female). Parents reported on children's weekday and weekend sleep durations, sleep environment, and family routines. High-resolution, T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired. Analyses focused on cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and amygdala and hippocampal volume. ResultsResults indicated that lower family income-to-needs ratio and parental education were significantly associated with shorter weekday sleep duration in children. Shorter weekday sleep duration was significantly associated with reduced thickness in the left middle temporal, right postcentral, and right superior frontal cortices and smaller basolateral but not centromedial amygdala volume. Family routines significantly mediated the associations of family income-to-needs ratio and parental education with weekday sleep duration in children. ConclusionThese results contribute to our understanding of sleep factors as proximal mechanisms through which socioeconomic context may alter neural development during childhood.

AB  - ER Bodies accumulate atypical myrosinases that hydrolyzes glucosinolates, generating chemically reactive products toxic to pathogens and herbivores. NAI2 is an ER Body component that facilitates ER body formation, similar to the ER Body, its homologous proteins are shown only in Brassicaceae. A new type of endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles, NAIP vesicles-which are related to the ER Body-have been found in recent years, and NAIPs (NAI2-interact proteins) not only play a critical and redundant role in ER Body formation, but also could assemble other proteins to coordinate or promote cargo recruitment to drive the formation of the NAIP vesicle. Unlike NAI2, homologous proteins of NAIPs are shown in all kinds of plants with 3 or 4 members, which increases the difficulty in studying the biological function of NAIP vesicles. Here, we optimized the CRISPR/Cas9 system for concurrent editing of multiple target genes by designing suitable multiple targeting sequences and ingeniously utilizing enzymatic sites for the linkage of various promoters. Additionally, appropriate methodologies were employed to construct CRISPR/Cas9 expression vectors and introduce them into tomato, resulting in knocking off three members of the NAIP vesicle-associated gene family. Noteworthy, this CRISPR/Cas9 system has potential applications for functional studies of the functionally redundant genes in eudicot plants. We also found that slnaip1/2/3s mutants were shorter in the youth age compared to the wild type, which provides a favorable clue for the subsequent identification of NAIP vesicles in other plants.

AB  - The integration of large language models (LLMs) into clinical diagnostics has the potential to transform doctor-patient interactions. However, the readiness of these models for real-world clinical application remains inadequately tested. This paper introduces the Conversational Reasoning Assessment Framework for Testing in Medicine (CRAFT-MD) approach for evaluating clinical LLMs. Unlike traditional methods that rely on structured medical examinations, CRAFT-MD focuses on natural dialogues, using simulated artificial intelligence agents to interact with LLMs in a controlled environment. We applied CRAFT-MD to assess the diagnostic capabilities of GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mistral and LLaMA-2-7b across 12 medical specialties. Our experiments revealed critical insights into the limitations of current LLMs in terms of clinical conversational reasoning, history-taking and diagnostic accuracy. These limitations also persisted when analyzing multimodal conversational and visual assessment capabilities of GPT-4V. We propose a comprehensive set of recommendations for future evaluations of clinical LLMs based on our empirical findings. These recommendations emphasize realistic doctor-patient conversations, comprehensive history-taking, open-ended questioning and using a combination of automated and expert evaluations. The introduction of CRAFT-MD marks an advancement in testing of clinical LLMs, aiming to ensure that these models augment medical practice effectively and ethically.

AB  - Termites live in a dynamic environment where colony health is strongly influenced by surrounding microbes. However, little is known about the mycobiomes of lower termites and their nests, and how these change in response to disease. Here we compared the individual and nest mycobiomes of a healthy subterranean termite colony (Coptotermes testaceus) to one infected and ultimately eradicated by a fungal pathogen. We identified Trichoderma species in the materials of both nests, but they were also abundant in the infected termites. Methanolic extracts of Trichoderma sp. FHG000531, isolated from the infected nest, were screened for secondary metabolites by UHPLC-HR MS/MS-guided molecular networking. We identified many bioactive compounds with potential roles in the eradication of the infected colony, as well as a cluster of six unknown peptides. The novel peptide FE011 was isolated and characterized by NMR spectroscopy. The function of this novel peptide family as well as the role of Trichoderma species in dying termite colonies therefore requires further investigation.

AB  - Background: The biosafety of gene therapy products remains a major challenge to their introduction into the clinic. In particular, the problem of immunogenicity of viral vectors is the focus of attention. Large animals such as pigs, whose anatomical and physiological characteristics are similar to those of humans, have an advantage in testing vector systems. Methods: We performed a comprehensive in vitro and in vivo study to evaluate the biosafety of a chimeric adenoviral vector carrying a green fluorescent protein gene (Ad5/35F-GFP) in a mini-pig model. Results: Transcriptome and secretome analyses of mini-pig leucocytes transduced with Ad5/35F-GFP revealed changes restraining pro-inflammatory processes and cytokine production. No adverse effects were revealed through the clinical, instrumental, laboratory, and histological examinations conducted within a week after the direct or autologous leucocyte-mediated administration of Ad5/35F-GFP to mini-pigs. The decrease in cytokine levels in the blood of experimental animals is also consistent with the in vitro data and confirms the immune tolerance of mini-pigs to Ad5/35F-GFP. Conclusions: Here, we show the safety of Ad5/35F in a mini-pig model and provide evidence that Ad5/35F is a promising vector for gene therapy. These results advance our understanding of vector-host interactions and offer a solid foundation for the clinical application of this vector.

AB  - Introduction: Both cannabis use and depressive symptomology increase in prevalence throughout adolescence. Concurrently, the brain is undergoing neurodevelopment in important limbic regions, such as the amygdala. Prior research indicates the amygdala may also be related to cannabis use and depressive symptoms. We aimed to investigate the effects of adolescent cannabis use on amygdala volumes as well as the interaction of cannabis use and amygdala morphometry on depressive symptoms in youth.<br /> Method: Two-hundred-twenty-four participants (ages 12-15), balanced by sex assigned at birth, were selected from a sub-sample of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study based on hair toxicology and self-report measures of cannabis use. Participants positive for cannabinoids in hair and/or self-reported cannabis use were demographically matched to youth with no self-reported or confirmed cannabis use. The guardians of these youth reported depression symptoms on the Child Behavioral Checklist. Linear mixed effect models were run investigating cannabis use group on amygdala volumes bilaterally, controlling for whole brain volume and random effects of scanner type. Additional analyses examined cannabis group status and bilateral amygdala volume on depression symptoms.<br /> Results: Cannabis use was not significantly associated with amygdala volume but was associated with increased depressive symptoms (p<0.01). Cannabis group interacted with amygdala volume, such that individuals with smaller volumes had increased depressive symptoms within the cannabis group (p's<0.01-0.02).<br /> Conclusion: Aberrations in amygdala volume based on cannabis use were not found in early adolescence; however, more depressive symptoms were related to cannabis group. Youth who use cannabis and have smaller amygdala volumes were at increased risk for depressive symptomology, suggesting potential neurovulnerabilities to cannabis use.

AB  - IntroductionChronic exposure to social defeat stress (SDS) has been used to investigate the neurobiology of depressive- and anxiety-like responses and mnemonic processes. We hypothesized that these affective, emotional, and cognitive consequences induced by SDS are regulated via glutamatergic neurons located in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), amygdaloid complex, and hippocampus in mice. MethodsHere, we investigated the influence of chronic SDS on (i) the avoidance behavior assessed in the social interaction test, (ii) the anxiety-like behavior (e.g., elevated plus-maze, and open field tests) (iii) depressive-like behaviors (e.g., coat state, sucrose splash, nesting building, and novel object exploration tests), (iv) the short-term memory (object recognition test), (v) & UDelta;FosB, CaMKII as well as & UDelta;FosB + CaMKII labeling in neurons located in the BNST, amygdaloid complex, dorsal (dHPC) and the ventral (vHPC) hippocampus. ResultsThe main results showed that the exposure of mice to SDS (a) increased defensive and anxiety-like behaviors and led to memory impairment without eliciting clear depressive-like or anhedonic effects; (b) increased & UDelta;FosB + CaMKII labeling in BNST and amygdala, suggesting that both areas are strongly involved in the modulation of this type of stress; and produced opposite effects on neuronal activation in the vHPC and dHPC, i.e., increasing and decreasing, respectively, & UDelta;FosB labeling. The effects of SDS on the hippocampus suggest that the vHPC is likely related to the increase of defensive- and anxiety-related behaviors, whereas the dHPC seems to modulate the memory impairment. DiscussionPresent findings add to a growing body of evidence indicating the involvement of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the circuits that modulate emotional and cognitive consequences induced by social defeat stress.

AB  - In recent decades, evidence has accumulated to suggest that the widespread and highly variable parasite Ichthyophonus hoferi is actually a species complex. Highly plastic morphology and a general lack of defining structures has contributed to the likely underestimate of biodiversity within this group. Molecular methods are a logical next step in the description of these parasites, but markers used to date have been too conserved to resolve species boundaries. Here we use mitochondrial encoded cytochrome-c oxidase (MTCO1) gene sequences and phylogenic analysis to compare Ichthyophonus spp. isolates from several marine and anadromous fish hosts. The resulting phylogeny displays lineage separation among isolates and possible host/niche segregation not previously described. The parasite type that infects Pacific herring Clupea pallasii, Atlantic herring C. harengus, Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, and Pacific staghorn sculpin Oligocottus maculosus (Clade A) is different from that which infects Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus, Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, and Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepsis (Clade B). MTCO1 sequences confirmed the presence of a more divergent Ichthyophonus sp. isolated from American shad Alosa sapidissima in rivers of eastern North America (Clade C), while American shad introduced to the Pacific Ocean are infected with the same parasite that infects Pacific herring (Clade A). Currently there are no consensus criteria for delimiting species within Ichthyophonidae, but MTCO1 sequences hold promise as a potential species identifying marker and useful epizootiological tool.

AB  - Simple Summary Two recent transmission chains of PRRSV-2-associated cases were documented in this study using field epidemiological and molecular genetic tools. The investigation highlighted the risks associated with the free movement of livestock in the European Union. To minimize this risk of re-infection of PRRS-free herds with PRRSV through animal imports, it is recommended that pigs are transported directly from the exporting holdings without the involvement of transit stations. Alternatively, the transit stations could be converted so that pigs in transit avoid contact with each other, thus preventing exposure to PRRSV infection.Abstract This study reports on the molecular epidemiology of Ingelvac-PRRS-MLV-associated cases in Hungary for the period 2020-2021. Field epidemiology investigations led the experts to conclude that imported pigs, which were shipped through transit stations in Denmark, introduced the vaccine virus. The movement of fatteners and the neglect of disease control measures contributed to the spread of the virus to PRRS-free pig holdings in the vicinity. Deep sequencing was performed to genetically characterize the genes coding for the virion antigens (i.e., ORF2 through ORF7). The study isolates exhibited a range of 0.1 to 1.8% nucleotide sequence divergence from the Ingelvac PRRS MLV and identified numerous polymorphic sites (up to 57 sites) along the amplified 3.2 kilo base pair genomic region. Our findings confirm that some PRRSV-2 vaccine strains can accumulate very high number of point mutations within a short period in immunologically naive pig herds.

AB  - Introduction Accurate post-mortem interval (PMI) estimation is essential in forensic investigations. Although various methods for PMI determination have been developed, only an approximate estimation is still achievable, and an accurate PMI indication is still challenging. Therefore, in this study, we employed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics to assess post-mortem changes in porcine blood samples collected with and without the addition of anticoagulant (EDTA). Our study aimed to identify metabolites dependent on the EDTA addition and time (taking into account the biodiversity of the studied organism) and those that are time-dependent but resistant to the addition of an anticoagulant.Methods The experiment was performed on blood samples collected from 16 animals (domestic pig, breed: Polish Large White), 8 with and 8 without EDTA addition. The moment of death (time 0) and 15 additional time points (from 3 to 168 h after death) were selected to examine changes in metabolites' levels in specific time intervals. We employed linear mixed models to study the relationship between metabolite intensities, time and presence of EDTA while accounting for the effect of individual pigs.Results and Discussion We confirmed that the intensity of 16 metabolites (mainly amino acids) significantly depends on PMI and the presence of EDTA. However, the intensity of the ideal biomarker(s) for PMI estimation should be determined only by the time after death and not by external factors such as the presence of the anticoagulant agent. Thus, we identified 41 metabolites with time-dependent intensities that were not susceptible to EDTA presence. Finally, we assessed the performance of these metabolites in a PMI predictive model. Citraconic acid yielded one of the lowest errors in general PMI estimation (32.82 h). Moreover, similar errors were observed for samples with and without EDTA (33.32 h and 32.34 h, respectively). Although the small sample size and information leak in predictive modelling prevent drawing definite conclusions, citraconic acid shows potential as a robust PMI estimator.

AB  - Tedera is a drought-tolerant perennial forage legume introduced in Australia in 2006. In October 2018, T15-1218 Lanza (R), the world's first tedera variety, was released by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development and Meat & Livestock Australia for commercial use. A key agronomic practise for the successful establishment and adoption of tedera is to have a robust herbicide package to control a range of grass and broadleaf weeds well tolerated by tedera. A total of 9 pre-emergent and 44 post-emergent herbicide treatments were evaluated in eight experiments from 2017 to 2021. To control grasses such as annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaud.), propyzamide and carbetamide can be recommended for pre- or post-emergent applications and butroxydim, clethodim, and haloxyfop for post-emergent applications. The broadleaf pre-emergent herbicides recommended are clopyralid to control emerged capeweed (Arctotheca calendula (L.) Levyns), fomesafen to control pre-emergent wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum L.), and the double mix of fomesafen + diuron, flumetsulam + diuron, and the triple mix of fomesafen + diuron + flumetsulam to control pre-emergent capeweed, pre- and post-emergent wild radish, and other broadleaf weeds. The most consistently well tolerated post-emergent herbicides by tedera seedlings and adult plants were diflufenican, diuron, flumetsulam, fomesafen, and their two- or three-way mixes that will provide good control of capeweed and wild radish. Desiccants such as paraquat or diquat were also well tolerated by 1-year-old tedera plants that recovered after being desiccated.

AB  - While livestock presence in national parks is often recognized, its environmental impact is usually treated as a separate issue, and it is commonly assumed that livestock numbers decline as tourism develops. However, this study examines the case of Mongolia, where livestock numbers have actually increased alongside tourism growth, leading to negative environmental consequences. This study introduces and explores the phenomenon termed "tourism-induced livestock concentration", referring to the rise in livestock numbers driven by unsustainable tourism development and the subsequent settlement of herders in the protected areas. This study is the first in Mongolia to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from livestock in specially protected areas, providing a focused analysis of the ecological footprint of tourism through GHG emissions. The findings confirm that tourism contributes to increased GHG emissions in these protected areas. Specifically, in Altai Tavan Bogd National Park, the number of tourists staying in the area increased by 2.7 times, while livestock numbers rose by 3.3 times during the study period. The results indicate that the growth in livestock populations, driven by tourism, has led to higher GHG emissions and intensified grazing pressure, negatively impacting the habitats and sustainability of rare plant and animal species within the park.

AB  - Introduction Human epidemiological studies suggest that heavy alcohol consumption may lead to earlier onset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), especially in individuals with a genetic predisposition for AD. Alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD) during a critical developmental timepoint, such as adolescence, interacts with AD-related pathologies to accelerate disease progression later in life. The current study investigates if voluntary exercise in mid-adulthood can recover memory deficits caused by the interactions between adolescence ethanol exposure and AD-transgenes.Methods Male and female TgF344-AD and wildtype F344 rats were exposed to an intragastric gavage of water (control) or 5 g/kg of 20% ethanol (adolescent intermittent ethanol; AIE) for a 2 day on/off schedule throughout adolescence (PD27-57). At 6 months old, rats either remained in their home cage (stationary) or were placed in a voluntary wheel running apparatus for 4 weeks and then underwent several behavioral tests. The number of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and measure of neurogenesis in the hippocampus were assessed.Results Voluntary wheel running recovers spatial working memory deficits selectively in female TgF344-AD rats exposed to AIE and improves pattern separation impairment seen in control TgF344-AD female rats. There were sex-dependent effects on brain pathology: Exercise improves the integration of recently born neurons in AIE-exposed TgF344-AD female rats. Exercise led to a decrease in amyloid burden in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, but only in male AIE-exposed TgF344-AD rats. Although the number of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons was not affected by AD-transgenes in either sex, AIE did reduce the number of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in female rats.Discussion These data provide support that even after symptom onset, AIE and AD related cognitive decline and associated neuropathologies can be rescued with exercise in unique sex-specific ways.

AB  - Understanding the molecular mechanisms used by phytophagous insects to survive and feed on new hosts is key to explaining their mechanisms of range expansion and diversification. However, only a few Neotropical biological models have been used to understand these mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the differences in gene expression of the Neotropical phytophagous insect Anastrepha obliqua Macquart (Diptera: Tephritidae), the West Indian Fruit Fly, when feeding on three different host plant species under sympatric and synchronous conditions. Third-instar larvae of A. obliqua infesting red mombin (Spondias purpurea L.), mango (Mangifera indica L.), and carambola (Averrhoa carambola L.) were collected in two localities in southwestern Colombia. After assembling a de novo transcriptome, differences in gene expression between larvae infesting the three host species were established using a batch effect design, controlling the variability introduced by location. Sixty-four differentially expressed unigenes were identified among flies infesting the different hosts, with the greatest number of genes differentially expressed between red mombin and carambola. Digestive genes, such as alpha-amylases and serine proteases, were upregulated in larvae from red mombin compared with mango (six genes) and carambola (four genes), suggesting the response of A. obliqua to the nutritional composition in red mombin. Also, two genes related to immune system responses, glutactin and acidic phospholipase A2, were upregulated in mango compared to carambola. Notably, genes annotated as transposable elements (TEs) were consistently upregulated in larvae infesting carambola and mango compared to larvae infesting red mombin. This may suggest the activation of these TEs in acclimation or adaptation to new hosts. Based on our results, the main categories of differentially expressed genes in A. obliqua were serine proteases, detoxification proteins, and proteins associated with the regulation of gene expression. These results support the potential of A. obliqua to adapt to host plants and its qualification as a generalist species.

AB  - Two new species of Rhinogobius found in streams on central part of Palawan Island, Philippines are described. The two new species, Rhinogobius estrellae and Rhinogobius tandikan share unique transverse rows of sensory papillae on the cheek with Rhinogobius similis Gill, 1859, but differ from the latter in fin ray counts, arrangement of the scales, etc. The two new species are distinguished from each other by the pectoral-fin ray count, the longitudinal-and predorsal-scale counts, and colouration of the body. Rhinogobius estrellae new species and R. tandikan new species have been found allopatrically in a stream within Malatgao River system flowing into the Sulu Sea and in the Cayulo River flowing into the South China Sea, respectively. The Malatgao River system is the southernmost habitat of the genus Rhinogobius. Rhinogobius similis had been considered as the only member of the most basal lineage of this genus, but our mitochondrial genome analysis suggested that the two new species are additional members of this lineage. They are considered to be relicts of their common ancestor with R. similis, which probably had a wider distribution.

AB  - Simple Summary Due to lacking exploitation capability, traditional genetic algorithm cannot accurately identify the minimal best gene subset. Thus, the improved splicing method is introduced into a genetic algorithm to enhance exploitation capability for achieving balance between exploitation and exploration of GA. It can effectively identify true gene subsets with high probability. Furthermore, a dataset of the body weight of Hu sheep has been used to show that the proposed method can obtain a better minimal subset of genes with a few iterations, compared with all considered algorithms including genetic algorithm and adaptive best-subset selection algorithm. Selecting the minimal best subset out of a huge number of factors for influencing the response is a fundamental and very challenging NP-hard problem because the presence of many redundant genes results in over-fitting easily while missing an important gene can more detrimental impact on predictions, and computation is prohibitive for exhaust search. We propose a modified memetic algorithm (MA) based on an improved splicing method to overcome the problems in the traditional genetic algorithm exploitation capability and dimension reduction in the predictor variables. The new algorithm accelerates the search in identifying the minimal best subset of genes by incorporating it into the new local search operator and hence improving the splicing method. The improvement is also due to another two novel aspects: (a) updating subsets of genes iteratively until the no more reduction in the loss function by splicing and increasing the probability of selecting the true subsets of genes; and (b) introducing add and del operators based on backward sacrifice into the splicing method to limit the size of gene subsets. Additionally, according to the experimental results, our proposed optimizer can obtain a better minimal subset of genes with a few iterations, compared with all considered algorithms. Moreover, the mutation operator is replaced by it to enhance exploitation capability and initial individuals are improved by it to enhance efficiency of search. A dataset of the body weight of Hu sheep was used to evaluate the superiority of the modified MA against the genetic algorithm. According to our experimental results, our proposed optimizer can obtain a better minimal subset of genes with a few iterations, compared with all considered algorithms including the most advanced adaptive best-subset selection algorithm.

AB  - IntroductionType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with cognitive impairment has a high incidence rate globally, and there is a need to investigate the relationship among the glymphatic system, hippocampus microstructure, and cognition in T2DM. The present study aims to delineate changes in the perivascular space index (ALPS-index) among T2DM patients with different cognitive states and investigate any possible correlation between the ALPS-index and the diffusive indicators of the bilateral hippocampi in T2DM. In addition, we seek to identify specific cognitive domains with substantial correlation with the ALPS-index in the general population.MethodsA total of 113 participants were recruited, comprising 37 T2DM patients with normal cognitive function (DMNC), 39 T2DM patients with mild cognitive impairment (DMMCI), and 37 healthy controls (HC). Clinical information, neuropsychological assessments, and experienced multimodal magnetic resonance imaging scans were recorded from all the participants. A noninvasive method was applied to obtain all ALPS-index measures, such as the left, right, and average ALPS-index, along with diffusive indicators of the bilateral hippocampi, comprising fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD).ResultsA statistically marginal difference in the average ALPS-index was noted among HC, DMNC, and DMMCI groups. According to binary logistic regression analysis results, the average ALPS-index significantly altered the cognitive function in T2DM. Partial correlation analyses revealed a positive association between the average ALPS-index and FA, as well as a negative association with MD and RD in the bilateral hippocampi of the T2DM groups. In the general population, partial correlation analysis indicated that the average ALPS-index correlated with the auditory verbal learning test (AVLT) immediate recall scores.ConclusionIn summary, our findings demonstrated that glymphatic system function in the brain progressively deteriorates with worsening cognitive impairment among T2DM patients. Moreover, T2DM significantly disrupts the relationship patterns between the glymphatic system and bilateral hippocampal microstructure. Thus, the mean ALPS-index may act as a novel neuroimaging biomarker for assessing cognitive function in T2DM.

AB  - Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is a highly contagious pathogen causing significant economic losses in the swine industry. Conventional inactivated or attenuated live vaccines for classical swine fever (CSF) are effective but face biosafety concerns and cannot distinguish vaccinated animals from those infected with the field virus, complicating CSF eradication efforts. It is noteworthy that nanoparticle (NP)-based vaccines resemble natural viruses in size and antigen structure, and offer an alternative tool to circumvent these limitations. In this study, we developed an innovative vaccine delivery scaffold utilizing self-assembled mi3 NPs, which form stable structures carrying the CSFV E2 glycoprotein. The expressed yeast E2-fused protein (E2-mi3 NPs) exhibited robust thermostability (25 to 70 degrees C) and long-term storage stability at room temperature (25 degrees C). Interestingly, E2-mi3 NPs made with this technology elicited enhanced antigen uptake by RAW264.7 cells. In a rabbit model, the E2-mi3 NP vaccine against CSFV markedly increased CSFV-specific neutralizing antibody titers. Importantly, it conferred complete protection in rabbits challenged with the C-strain of CSFV. Furthermore, we also found that the E2-mi3 NP vaccines triggered stronger cellular (T-lymphocyte proliferation, CD8+ T-lymphocytes, IFN-gamma, IL-2, and IL-12p70) and humoral (CSFV-specific neutralizing antibodies, CD4+ T-lymphocytes, and IL-4) immune responses in pigs than the E2 vaccines. To sum up, these structure-based, self-assembled mi3 NPs provide valuable insights for novel antiviral strategies against the constantly infectious agents.

AB  - Introduction Trauma reexperiencing is dominated by recollection of sensory-perceptual elements of the trauma, pointing to involvement of the sensory thalamus. This study examined posttraumatic stress symptoms in relation to volumes of thalamic nuclei that were grouped based on their predominant functions. We hypothesized that reexperiencing, controlling for other symptom dimensions, would correlate with volumes of thalamic nuclei involved in primary and higher-order sensory processing. Methods Seventy-two trauma-exposed adults were interviewed with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV and underwent 3T magnetic resonance imaging. Scores were derived for reexperiencing, anxious arousal, dysphoric arousal, emotional numbing, and avoidance symptoms. These were entered as simultaneous predictors in five separate regression analyses, with age, sex, and total thalamus volume as covariates, predicting volumesf of five thalamus nuclear groupings corrected for intracranial volume: Specific sensory, associative-sensory, associative-cognitive, intralaminar, and motor groupings. Results Reexperiencing symptoms were significantly positively correlated with volumes of the motor thalamic grouping, which included the ventral anterior, ventral lateral, and ventromedial nuclei. Anxious arousal was significantly negatively correlated with volumes of all five thalamic groupings. Conclusions Reexperiencing symptoms were correlated with volumes of the motor thalamus, while anxious arousal symptoms were related to all thalamic subregion volumes. Thalamic nuclei involved in motor functions, including oculomotor control and motor planning, may be implicated in posttraumatic reexperiencing symptoms.

AB  - Introduction The differences of functional connectivity (FC) and functional asymmetry between left and right mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (LMTLE and RMTLE) have not been completely clarified yet. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the FC changes and the FC asymmetric patterns of MTLE, and to compare the differences in FC and functional asymmetry between LMTLE and RMTLE. Methods In total, 12 LMTLE, 11 RMTLE patients, and 23 healthy controls (HC) were included. Region of interest (ROI)-based analysis was used to evaluate FC. The right functional connectivity (rFC) and left functional connectivity (lFC) of each ROI were calculated. Asymmetry index (AI) was calculated based on the following formula: AI=100x(rFC-lFC)/[(rFC+lFC)/2]${\rm{AI\ }} = {\rm{\ }}100{\rm{\ }} \times {\rm{\ }}( {{\rm{rFC}} - {\rm{lFC}}} )/[ {( {{\rm{rFC}} + {\rm{lFC}}} )/2} ]$. Paired t-test and univariate analysis of variance were used to analyze FC asymmetry. Linear correlation analysis was performed between significant FC changes and lateralized ROIs and epilepsy onset age and duration. Results LMTLE and RMTLE patients showed different patterns of alteration in FC and functional asymmetry when compared with controls. RMTLE presented more extensive FC abnormalities than LMTLE. Regions in ipsilateral temporal lobe presented as central regions of abnormalities in both patient groups. In addition, the asymmetric characteristics of FC were reduced in MTLE compared with HC, with even more pronounced reduction for RMTLE group. Meanwhile, ROIs presented FC AI differences among the three groups were mostly involving left temporal lobe (L_hippo, L_amyg, L_TP, L_aMTG, and L_pTFusC). No correlation was found between significant FC changes and lateralized ROIs and epilepsy onset age and duration. Conclusion The FC and asymmetric features of MTLE are altered and involve both the temporal lobe and extra-temporal lobe. Furthermore, the altered FC and asymmetric features were distinctly affected in LMTLE and RMTLE compared to controls.

AB  - Cariprazine, a dopamine D2/D3 receptor partial agonist with high affinity for D3 receptors, is effective in treating bipolar disorder and depression; however, the precise neural mechanisms underlying its actions remain incompletely understood. This study investigates how cariprazine modulates affective and social behaviors through D3 neurons in the olfactory tubercle (OT). Local infusion of cariprazine specifically into the OT, but not the nucleus accumbens (NAc) or hippocampus, induced anxiety-like behaviors, impaired struggling behaviors in depression-related tests, and increased huddling behavior, a measure of thermoregulation and social interaction. These behavioral changes were associated with decreased D3 neuronal activity in the OT, as evidenced by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Optogenetic activation of OT D3 neurons normalized cariprazine-induced anxiety-like behaviors and blunted the increase in struggling and huddling behavior. Additionally, cariprazine administration elevated body temperature, likely due to enhanced huddling behavior. These findings underscore the critical role of OT D3 neurons in mediating cariprazine's effects on affective and social behaviors, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying its therapeutic actions and the involvement of ventral striatal D3 neurons in neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - An introduction to a novel habitat represents a challenge to plants because they likely would face new interactions and possibly different physical context. When plant populations arrive to a new region free from herbivores, we can expect an evolutionary change in their defense level, although this may be contingent on the type of defense, resistance or tolerance, and cost of defense. Here, we addressed questions on the evolution of tolerance to damage in non-native Spanish populations of Datura stramonium by means of two comparative greenhouse experiments. We found differences in seed production, specific leaf area, and biomass allocation to stems and roots between ranges. Compared to the Mexican native populations of this species, non-native populations produced less seeds despite damage and allocate more biomass to roots and less to stems, and had higher specific leaf area values. Plasticity to leaf damage was similar between populations and no difference in tolerance to damage between native and non-native populations was detected. Costs for tolerance were detected in both regions. Two plasticity traits of leaves were associated with tolerance and were similar between regions. These results suggest that tolerance remains beneficial to plants in the non-native region despite it incurs in fitness costs and that damage by herbivores is low in the non-native region. The study of the underlying traits of tolerance can improve our understanding on the evolution of tolerance in novel environments, free from plants' specialist herbivores.

AB  - The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9 system has been a recent focus of breeders owing to its potential to improve economically significant traits of livestock. The introduction of defined point mutations into the ovine genome via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair has been reported; however, indel and mosaic events observed in genetically modified animals limit the practical application of this system in sheep breeding. The FecGF mutation (g. G1111A, p. V371 M) in the growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) gene is strongly associated with litter size in Belclare and Norwegian White Sheep. In the present study, we introduced the FecGF mutation in GDF9 by co-injecting the CRISPR/Cas9 system, single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN), and Scr7 into ovine zygotes. Scr7 at various concentrations (0 mu M, 1 mu M, and 2 mu M) had no adverse effects on embryonic development in vitro. No significant differences in total mutation, point mutation, and indel rates in embryos were observed among groups treated with different concentrations of Scr7. However, the mosaicism rates of embryos from zygotes microinjected with 1 and 2 mu M Scr7 were significantly lower than that for 0 mu M Scr7 (7.7% and 7.5% vs. 19.7%). We successfully obtained lambs with defined nucleotide substitutions by the coinjection of Cas9 mRNA, sgRNA, ssODN, and 1 mu M Scr7 into Altay sheep zygotes. The single nucleotide mutation efficiency was 7.69% (3/39) in newborn lambs, with one mosaic. Our findings provide evidence that Scr7 could improve the specificity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for the introduction of a defined point mutation in livestock to some extent.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Human-induced mortality poses a significant threat to many species worldwide, with Asian elephants in India being notably impacted. In recent years, electrocution-related elephant deaths have increased, particularly in the Northern District Landscape of West Bengal. A major contributor is the proliferation of illegal and hazardous electric fencing near protected forest areas. In many cases, farmers install electrified fences-often unauthorized-to prevent crop damage from elephant incursions. Unfortunately, these measures frequently result in fatal outcomes, escalating tensions and provoking retaliatory actions. This study assesses the spatio-temporal extent of elephant electrocution incidents across a forested region of approximately 12,000 km2. A total of 63 elephant deaths were documented using official records from the Forest and Wildlife Directorate. Each location was assessed for temporal factors such as year, month, and time of occurrence. Advanced geospatial techniques-including remote sensing and GIS-were utilized, with kernel density estimation applied to generate a detailed risk map. The analysis reveals critical high-risk zones in Bagdogra, Apalchand, Moraghat, and Dalgaon, while Ramsai, Rajabhatkhawa, Kartika, and Kumargram exhibit lower risk levels. The study identifies key drivers of these fatalities and highlights the pressing need for intervention. The study highlights key contributing factors to electrocution deaths and emphasizes the urgency of targeted interventions. This research aims to support conservation efforts for the endangered Asian elephant and offers valuable insights into mitigating human-elephant conflict. It underscores the importance of collaborative efforts involving forest officials, Gram Panchayat bodies, NGOs, and Joint Forest Management Committees to implement effective preventive measures in identified high-risk areas.

TI  - RETRACTED: Research on Recognition Effect of DSCN Network Structure in Hand-Drawn Sketch (Retracted Article)
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - With the rapid development of image recognition technology, freehand sketch recognition has attracted more and more attention. How to achieve good recognition effect in the absence of color and texture information is the key to the development of freehand sketch recognition. Traditional nonlearning classical models are highly dependent on manual selection features. To solve this problem, a neural network sketch recognition method based on DSCN structure is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the stroke sequence of the sketch is drawn; then, the feature is extracted according to the stroke sequence combined with neural network, and the extracted image features are used as the input of the model to construct the time relationship between different image features.Through the control experiment on TU-Berlin dataset, the results show that, compared with the traditional nonlearning methods, HOG-SVM, SIFT-Fisher Vector, MKL-SVM, and FV-SP, the recognition accuracy of DSCN network is improved by 15.8%, 10.3%, 6.0%, and 2.9%, respectively. Compared with the classical deep learning model, Alex-Net, the recognition accuracy is improved by 5.6%. The above results show that the DSCN network proposed in this paper has strong ability of feature extraction and nonlinear expression and can effectively improve the recognition accuracy of hand-painted sketches after introducing the stroke order.

AB  - Farm procedures have an impact on animal welfare by activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that induces a wide array of physiological responses. This adaptive system guarantees that the animal copes with environmental variations and it induces metabolic and molecular changes that can be quantified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in the regulation of homeostasis and emerging evidence has identified circulating miRNAs as promising biomarkers of stress-related disorders in animals. Based on a clustering analysis of salivary cortisol trends and levels, 20 ewes were classified into two different clusters. The introduction of a ram in the flock was identified as a common farm practice and reference time point to collect saliva samples. Sixteen miRNAs related to the adaptation response were selected. Among them, miR-16b, miR-21, miR-24, miR-26a, miR-27a, miR-99a, and miR-223 were amplified in saliva samples. Cluster 1 was characterized by a lower expression of miR-16b and miR-21 compared with Cluster 2 (p < 0.05). This study identified for the first time several miRNAs expressed in sheep saliva, pointing out significant differences in the expression patterns between the cortisol clusters. In addition, the trend analyses of these miRNAs resulted in clusters (p = 0.017), suggesting the possible cooperation of miR-16b and -21 in the integrated stress responses, as already demonstrated in other species as well. Other research to define the role of these miRNAs is needed, but the evaluation of the salivary miRNAs could support the selection of ewes for different profiles of response to sources of stressors common in the farm scenario.

AB  - Based on the original data on the fractionation of stomach and excrements contents, the effectiveness of the masticatory apparatus and post-gastric transformation of food particles in representatives of small herbivorous mammals is considered. It was found out that in the group of small animals with a body mass from 20 to 200 g the effectiveness of chewing does not depend on the body size but is due to the specifics of the functioning of the chewing apparatus. Particle reduction in this group is masked by a rapid change in digestion regimes, the intensity of nonspecific or specialized coprophagy, and the development of the fiber separation mechanism in the large intestine, which leads to high variability of results. The influence of body size is realized when larger herbivores with a body mass of up to 3-5 kg (hares) and up to 20 kg (beavers) are introduced into the comparison. In this case the influence of body size on the effectiveness of chewing is clearly manifested. In this interaction between the groups of animals, effects similar to those previously established in a wide comparative series of large herbivores with a body mass of up to 3000 kg were revealed. Thus, chewing can be considered as a function of body size, when comparing animals that differ significantly in body mass. Special attention is paid to the fraction of the finest particles, as containing not only fragments of fibers, but also non-food inclusions.

AB  - The Sardinian grass snake, Natrix helvetica cetti, is an island-endemic subspecies with a restricted and highly fragmented distribution confined to Sardinia, Italy. Information on its reproductive biology and wild offspring remain scarce in the scientific literature. This present study reports the first recorded data on a clutch of eggs laid by a wild melanistic female N. h. cetti that exhibited lethargy when observed basking, prompting a brief period of health monitoring and screening for the presence of the pathogenic fungus Ophidiomyces ophidiicola (Oo). The clutch yielded nine hatchlings, for which phenotypic data are provided and compared with existing information on the Natrix natrix complex. Both the adult female and its offspring tested negative in the Oo screening. The body size of the adult grass snake, specifically its snout-to-vent length of 48.3 cm, is the smallest ever recorded for a gravid female N. helvetica. This may indicate that maturity is reached at particularly small sizes, a distinctive trait of this intriguing island subspecies, suggesting the need for further investigation.

AB  - Introduction Chronic inflammation caused by Escherichia coli infections has a significant negative impact on the reproductive system and impairs fertility. The corpus luteum (CL) plays a central role not only in regulating the ovary cycle, but also in implantation of the embryo and maintenance of early pregnancy through the secretion of progesterone. Understanding the intricate interplay between inflammatory processes and reproductive organ's function is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic strategies to alleviate reproductive disorders and improve fertility.Methods The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the proteomic profile of the porcine CL in the mid-luteal phase of the estrous cycle using LC-MS/MS analysis. The CL slices were incubated in the presence of LPS for 24 h.Results We identified 12 differentially regulated proteins after treatment with LPS (7 of them were upregulated, while 5 were downregulated). The analysis showed that these proteins are involved in processes such as glucose metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), detoxification processes as well as steroid biosynthesis in the CL. Moreover, we demonstrated that LPS decreases glucose levels and increases progesterone levels in the CL.Conclusion These findings suggest that LPS modulates key metabolic pathways in the CL, potentially impacting its functional activity.

AB  - The paper presents an experimental investigation on the nonlinear bending moments of an ultra large container ship over 300 m long in rough waves. The design and calibration procedure of the scaled segmented ship model with variable cross-section backbone beam is introduced. Transfer functions of vertical bending moments at different Froude numbers, wave headings and wave heights are analyzed. Ship responses in harsh waves are analyzed and the largest wave height to wavelength ratio exceeds 1/10. It is interesting and significant to analyze the strongly nonlinear behaviors of the ship in such high waves. The resonance frequencies, proportion of highorder harmonic components, asymmetry of hogging and sagging moments as well as the phase differences between wave-frequency and high-order harmonics in extreme waves are investigated systematically.

AB  - Simple Summary The need to establish a social hierarchy represents a period of severe stress for sows when they are introduced into new groups because of the associated aggressive behavior. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of providing access to straw in racks and manila ropes (IMPROVED) on aggressive behavior after mixing, compared to a typical minimal enrichment gestation system (CONTROL), and to understand the effect of parity order and backfat on the level of the aggression. The overall average number of fights and the initiated aggressive behavior in the three observation days were greater in the CONTROL pens, although within time, we found a significant effect of treatment only on the number of fights performed 3 weeks post-mixing. The effect of backfat thickness revealed an effect only on the observations of initiated aggressive behavior, which was most frequently performed by sow with a low backfat thickness. Parity order did not have a significant effect on the display of any of the aggressive behaviors. These results suggest that aggression at mixing is unavoidable and, indeed, is essential to ensuring the establishment of the dominance hierarchy and thereby achieving group stability. Nevertheless, optimal enrichment materials could have a beneficial effect on at least reducing its frequency. For sows introduced into new groups, the aggressive behavior associated with establishing a social hierarchy represents a period of severe stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of providing sows with an improved pen environment (straw in racks and ropes) on aggressive behavior after mixing and to understand the role played by sow back fat thickness and parity order. At 29 d post-service, sows were mixed into IMPROVED or CONTROL pens with individual feeding stalls (6 groups/treatment, 20 sows/group). Aggressive behavior was recorded for 2 h at mixing (T0) and 24 h (T1) and 3 weeks post-mixing (T21). Overall, the sows in the CONTROL pens performed more fighting behavior compared to the IMPROVED sows (p < 0.001). This difference was significant only at T21 (p < 0.001). Additionally, the sows in the CONTROL pens generally initiated more aggressive behaviors than the sows in the IMPROVED pens (p = 0.02). The sows with a low back fat thickness initiated more aggressive behaviors, but parity had no significant effect on any of the aggressive behaviors. These results indicate a beneficial effect of improvements to the pen environment on the aggression performed by group-housed sows between the time of mixing and three weeks later. The effect was reduced on the day of mixing, which is in accordance with the necessity for sows to employ aggression to establish the dominance hierarchy.

AB  - IntroductionDepression is a prevalent and significant psychological consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, exacerbates the neurological damage associated with TBI. This study investigates whether nicorandil, a potassium channel opener with nitrate-like properties known for its antioxidative and neuroprotective effects, can mitigate depression-like behaviors following TBI by modulating ferroptosis.MethodsA controlled cortical impact (CCI) device was used to establish the TBI model. Depression-like behaviors in rats were assessed using the sucrose preference test (SPT), the tail suspension test (TST), and the forced swimming test (FST). The antioxidant system, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis levels were evaluated. The SLC7A11/GPX4 axis was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis.ResultsNicorandil administration significantly ameliorated depression-like behaviors in rats with TBI. Nicorandil administration also effectively restored the antioxidant system, substantially reduced lipid peroxidation, and attenuated ferroptosis in the hippocampus of rats with TBI. Mechanistically, nicorandil administration promoted the SLC7A11/GPX4 axis in the hippocampus of rats with TBI. Crucially, knockdown of hippocampal SLC7A11 abrogated the protective effects of nicorandil on depression-like behaviors, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis in the hippocampus of rats with TBI.ConclusionThese findings indicate that nicorandil ameliorates depression-like behaviors following TBI by inhibiting hippocampal ferroptosis through the activation of the SLC7A11/GPX4 axis.

AB  - Taxonomy of the genus Rhinogobius was investigated for the first time in Central Vietnam. Five species occurring in this region can be distinguished by shape of their head, number of pectoral-fin rays, vertebral counts, arrangements of scales and cutaneous sensory papillae, and coloration. Two species are described as new, Rhinogobius rong sp. nov. and R. nami sp. nov., and the remaining three were identified as R. taenigena, R. leavelli, and R. similis. Though the morphology of R. leavelli and R. similis differed slightly between localities, counts and measurements overlapped, and coloration was variable. This study tentatively identifies all of those populations as R. leavelli or R. similis, but further research using additional specimens from a wider geographic range is required to clear the identity of the Rhinogobius occurring in this region. Rhinogobius rong, R. similis, and R. leavelli are distributed in both Da Nang City and Thua Thien Hue Province, with the first two species occurring widely in coastal areas, and R. leavelli restricted to inland areas. On the other hand, Rhinogobius nami and R. taenigena occur only in inland areas of Da Nang City and Thua Thien Hue Province, respectively.

AB  - The camel-spider Galeodes graecus C. L. Koch, 1842, is poorly known and still insufficiently studied in taxonomic, faunistic and ecological aspects. This study represents 59 new records of this species from Bulgaria (57) and North Macedonia (2). The taxonomic characters distinguishing this species from its most similar congeners are discussed and illustrated by digital photographs and drawings. On the basis of 41 observations, the species is active between 4th June and 31th August and mainly between 20:30 h and 1:00 h. A critical review of the geographical distribution of G. graecus is presented. The confirmed geographical distribution of the species includes Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece (incliding islands), North Macedonia and Turkey. The previously published records from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Ethiopia, Italy, Israel, Russia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Tunisia are considered doubtful.

AB  - Simple Summary The successful introduction of gilts into breeding groups is a key component of overall productivity. Therefore, the development of estrus synchronization protocols that optimize labor and time would benefit pig production. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of the estrus synchronization protocol using a single administration of estradiol cypionate on day 12 of the estrus cycle to mimic the maternal recognition of pregnancy in pigs and thus prolong luteal function. Subsequently we treated gilts which displayed prolonged luteal function with prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) to induce luteolysis and synchronize estrus. We also evaluated the effect of this protocol on fertility and ovarian function. We observed that a single administration of estradiol cypionate at the time of maternal recognition of pregnancy was effective to induce prolonged luteal function, and treatment of these gilts with PGF2 alpha resulted in fertile estrus within a short period of time. Furthermore, no deleterious effects were observed on fertility, follicular development, uterine histoarchitecture, and ovarian function. Based in our results, a single administration of estradiol cypionate followed by PGF2 alpha injection was effective to synchronize estrus in gilts without deleterious effects of reproductive function. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of using estrogen-induced prolonged luteal function followed by prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) treatment to synchronize estrus in gilts. On day12 of the estrus cycle (D0 = first day of standing estrus), 52 gilts were assigned at random to two experimental groups: non-treated gilts (CON, n = 22), serving as controls, and prolonged luteal function group (CYP, n = 30), receiving a single treatment with 10 mg of estradiol cypionate intramuscularly Starting on day 12, blood samples were collected for estradiol and progesterone assays. Estrus detection started on day 17. Gilts from the CON group were inseminated at the onset of natural estrus. On day 28 CYP gilts were treated with PGF2 alpha to induce luteolysis and inseminated at the onset of estrus. Gilts were slaughtered 5 d after the last insemination. A single treatment with estradiol cypionate prolonged luteal function in 90% of treated gilts. The duration of the estrous cycle was longer (p < 0.0001) for CYP gilts compared to CON gilts. CYP gilts showed synchronized estrus 3.96 +/- 0.19 d after induction of luteolysis. The conception rate was similar (p = 0.10) for CON and CYP gilts. No difference was observed in the embryo recovery rate (p = 0.18) and total number of embryos per female (p = 0.06). The percentage of unfertilized oocytes, fragmented embryos and viable embryos was similar among females from CON and CYP groups (p > 0.05). The treatment of gilts with a single application of 10 mg of estradiol cypionate on day 12 of the estrous cycle was effective in prolonging luteal function and treatment with PGF2 alpha resulted in synchronized estrus. Additionally, the synchronization protocol had no deleterious effect on fertility and embryonic development.

AB  - Heath monitors (Varanus rosenbergi) are arguably the most thoroughly studied Australian varanid, largely stemming from long-term research on Kangaroo Island, South Australia. However, research on other populations within this species' disjunct distribution is limited. We opportunistically tracked a heath monitor in the Little Desert National Park, Victoria, after it consumed a painted dragon (Ctenophorus pictus) which we were radiotracking for another study. We report the first record of a heath monitor depredating a painted dragon, as well as the first record of heath monitors repeatedly using a hollow log for shelter. The hollow log was occupied on 10 consecutive occasions over 18 days, and then again on five occasions 9-11 months later. Our observations identify hollow logs as a habitat resource which should be considered in conservation strategies for this threatened monitor lizard. Furthermore, we observed two individuals in close proximity, possibly a breeding pair, in January. This implies that breeding may occur in summer for the Victorian mallee population, as has been reported in other populations, rather than in spring as has been speculated. Research is sorely needed across this species' disjunct distribution across southern Australia. To date, populations of heath monitors in the Victorian mallee have garnered no scientific study, despite their listing as Critically Endangered.

AB  - The structure-function and materials paradigms drive research on the understanding of structures and structural heterogeneity of molecules and solids from materials science to structural biology. Functional insights into complex architectures are often gained from a suite of complementary physicochemical methods. In the context of biomacromolecular structures, the use of pulse dipolar electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (PDS) has become increasingly popular. The main interest in PDS is providing long-range nanometre distance distributions that allow for identifying macromolecular topologies, validating structural models and conformational transitions as well as docking of quaternary complexes. Most commonly, cysteines are introduced into protein structures by site-directed mutagenesis and modified site-specifically to a spin-labelled side-chain such as a stable nitroxide radical. In this contribution, we investigate labelling by four different commercial labelling agents that react through different sulfur-specific reactions. Further, the distance distributions obtained are between spin-bearing moieties and need to be related to the protein structure via modelling approaches. Here, we compare two different approaches to modelling these distributions for all four side-chains. The results indicate that there are significant differences in the optimum labelling procedure. All four spin-labels show differences in the ease of labelling and purification. Further challenges arise from the different tether lengths and rotamers of spin-labelled side-chains; both influence the modelling and translation into structures. Our comparison indicates that the spin-label with the shortest tether in the spin-labelled side-group, (bis-(2,2,5,5-Tetramethyl-3-imidazoline-1-oxyl-4-yl) disulfide, may be underappreciated and could increase the resolution of structural studies by PDS if labelling conditions are optimised accordingly.

AB  - Although mammoth ivory was claimed as a substitute to elephant ivory, there are several issues with the current methods to differentiate the two ivory, which provided a loophole to laundering and illegal trade. To contribute to developing efficient tools to distinguish ivory samples, we applied a relatively cheap and fast protocol using stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta C-13), hydrogen (delta H-2), nitrogen (delta N-15), oxygen (delta O-18), and sulfur (delta S-34). We compared the isotope ratios of the two ivory types and found statistically significant (p-value<0.01) differences in the Wilcoxon tests for delta H-2, delta O-18, delta C-13 and delta S-34, but no significant difference for delta N-15. There was no overlap between delta H-2 and a small overlap for delta O-18, while delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta S-34 of most mammoth samples were within the larger isotopic range values of the elephant samples. The PCA also pointed to a higher contribution of delta H-2 (96.9%) followed by delta O-18 (2.7%) to differentiate the ivory types. Our results showed SIA as an efficient tool to distinguish elephant and mammoth ivory, and we recommend using a multi-elements SIA approach focusing on delta H-2 and delta O-18. While it is essential to address the social issues related to the ivory trade, including reducing human-elephant conflict and increasing financial support to Siberian carver communities, alternatives for natural ivory should also be sought, combined with strict policy changes to combat illegal trade and protect the African and Asian elephant populations.

AB  - In the healthcare system, lower leg fractures remain relevant, incurring costs related to surgical treatment, hospitalization, and rehabilitation. The duration of treatment may vary depending on the individual case and its severity. Casting as a post-surgical fracture treatment is a common method in human and experimental veterinary medicine. Despite the high importance of sheep in preclinical testing materials for osteosynthesis, there is no standardised cast system ensuring proper stabilisation and functionality of hind limbs during the healing of tibia fractures or defects. Existing treatment approaches for tibial osteosynthesis in laboratory animal science include sling hanging, external fixators, or former Achilles tendon incision. These methods restrict animal movement for 4-6 weeks, limit species-typical behaviour, and impact social interactions. Our pilot study introduces a Standardised Walking Cast (SWC) for sheep, enabling immediate physiological movement post surgery. Seven Rhone sheep (female, 63.5 kg +/- 6.45 kg) each with a single tibia defect (6 mm mechanical drilled defect) underwent SWC application for 4 weeks after plate osteosynthesis. The animals bore weight on their operated leg from day one, exhibiting slight lameness (grade 1-2 out of 5). Individual step lengths showed good uniformity (average deviation: 0.89 cm). Group housing successfully started on day three after surgery. Weekly X-rays and cast changes ensured proper placement, depicting the healing process. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an SWC for up to 72 kg of body weight without sling hanging via ceiling mounting or external fixation techniques. Allowing species-typical movement and social behaviour can significantly improve the physiological behaviour of sheep in experiments, contributing to refinement.

AB  - L-Asparaginases have remained an intriguing research topic since their discovery similar to 120 years ago, especially after their introduction in the 1960s as very efficient antileukemic drugs. In addition to bacterial asparaginases, which are still used to treat childhood leukemia, enzymes of plant and mammalian origin are now also known. They have all been structurally characterized by crystallography, in some cases at outstanding resolution. The structural data have also shed light on the mechanistic details of these deceptively simple enzymes. Yet, despite all this progress, no better therapeutic agents have been found to beat bacterial asparaginases. However, a new option might arise with the discovery of yet another type of asparaginase, those from symbiotic nitrogen-fixing Rhizobia, and with progress in the protein engineering of enzymes with desired properties. This review surveys the field of structural biology of L-asparaginases, focusing on the mechanistic aspects of the well established types and speculating about the potential of the new members of this amazingly diversified family.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated a close association between alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-pro-pionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and depressive disorders, and activation of AMPARs may represent a promising way to treat depression. However, the effects of AMPAR potentiators on depression and the underlying mechanism have not been comprehensively clarified. We used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish a depressive mouse model and an in vitro damage model of SH-SY5Y cells, and the AMPAR potentiator LY450108 was introduced to the study. We found that LY450108 alleviated LPS-induced depressive behavior and abnormal phosphorylation of hippocampal AMPARs in mice. LY450108 also alleviated LPS-induced apoptosis and decreased the viability of SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, LY450108 protected SH-SY5Y cells from LPS-induced abnormal phosphorylation of AMPARs. In conclusion, our findings suggest that LY450108 has antidepressant effects against LPS-induced neuronal damage and depression.

AB  - Waterlettuce, Pistia stratiotes L. (Araceae: Pistieae) is an invasive free-floating aquatic weed found throughout the world that has been targeted for control using various methods including classical and conservation bio-logical control and, herbicides. In Florida, herbicides are the primary strategy employed by land managers, often without regard to the impact of herbivorous arthropods including Samea multiplicalis Guenee (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), Elophila [=Synclita] obliteralis Walker (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), Argyractis [=Petrophila] dru-malis (Dyer) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), Draeculacephala inscripta VanDuzee (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), Rho-palosiphum nymphaeae L. (Hemiptera: Aphididae), Orthogalumna terebrantis Wallwork (Acarina: Galumnidae), and Neohydronomus affinis Hustache (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea). A series of field experiments from 2009 to 2012 were conducted at three sites in Florida to quantify the levels of suppression by these species, using an insecticide-check approach to produce restricted and unrestricted herbivory conditions. Four of the species (E. obliteralis, S. multiplicalis, O. terebrantis, and N. affinis) were found at every field site. At the end of the experiment, plots exposed to unrestricted herbivory contained 63.1 % less biomass and covered 32.0 % less surface area compared to plots with restricted herbivory. These results indicate that naturally occurring and introduced species are suppressing the growth of waterlettuce populations in the field in Florida. Future research will examine the synergistic potential of actively managing herbicides and herbivorous arthropods to suppress waterlettuce.

AB  - IntroductionSelf-incompatibility (SI) is an important strategy for plants to maintain abundant variation to enhance their adaptability to the environment. Camellia oleifera is one of the most important woody oil plants and is widely cultivated in China. Late acting self-incompatibility (LSI) in C. oleifera results in a relatively poor fruit yield in the natural state, and understanding of the LSI mechanism remains limited. MethodsTo better understand the molecular expression and gene coexpression network in the LSI reaction in C. oleifera, we conducted self- and cross-pollination experiments at two different flower bud developmental stages (3-4 d before flowering and 1 d before flowering), and cytological observation, fruit setting rate (FSR) investigation and RNA-Seq analysis were performed to investigate the mechanism of the male -female interaction and identify hub genes responsible for the LSI in C. oleifera. ResultsBased on the 21 ovary transcriptomes, a total of 7669 DEGs were identified after filtering out low-expression genes. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) divided the DEGs into 15 modules. Genes in the blue module (1163 genes) were positively correlated with FSR, and genes in the pink module (339 genes) were negatively correlated with FSR. KEGG analysis indicated that flavonoid biosynthesis, plant MAPK signaling pathways, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and plant-pathogen interaction were the crucial pathways for the LSI reaction. Fifty four transcription factors (TFs) were obtained in the two key modules, and WRKY and MYB were potentially involved in the LSI reaction in C. oleifera. Network establishment indicated that genes encoding G-type lectin S-receptor-like serine (lecRLK), isoflavone 3'-hydroxylase-like (CYP81Q32), cytochrome P450 87A3-like (CYP87A3), and probable calcium-binding protein (CML41) were the hub genes that positively responded to the LSI reaction. The other DEGs inside the two modules, including protein RALF-like 10 (RALF), F-box and pectin acetylesterase (MTERF5), might also play vital roles in the LSI reaction in C. oleifera. DiscussionOverall, our study provides a meaningful resource for gene network studies of the LSI reaction process and subsequent analyses of pollen-pistil interactions and TF roles in the LSI reaction, and it also provides new insights for exploring the mechanisms of the LSI response.

AB  - The central route of streptozotocin (STZ) administration has been introduced as a rat model of sporadic Alzheimer 's disease (AD). Curcumin was suggested to possess possible neuroprotective effects, which may be profitable in AD. However, the low bioavailability of curcumin hinders its beneficial effects in clinical studies. Earlier studies suggested that a bovine serum albumin-based nanocurcumin, produces superior neuroprotective effects compared to natural curcumin. In the present study, the protective effect of nanocurcumin in rat model of central STZ induced memory impairment was assessed. In addition, due to the importance of the hippocampus in memory, the amounts of hippocampal active caspase-3, Akt, and CaMKII- alpha were evaluated. Adult male Wistar rats weighing 250 -300 g were used. STZ (icv) was injected during days 1 and 3 (3 mg/kg in divided), and nanocurcumin or curcumin 50 mg/kg/oral gavage was administered daily during days 4 -14. Morris water maze training was performed on days 15 -17, and the retention memory test was achieved on the 18th day. Following memory assessment, the rats were sacrificed and the hippocampi were used to assess caspase-3 cleavage, Akt, and CaMKII- alpha signaling. The findings revealed that nanocurcumin ingestion (but not natural curcumin) in the dose of 50 mg/kg was capable to prevent the impairment of water maze learning and memory induced by central STZ. Molecular assessments indicated that STZ treatment increased the caspase-3 cleavage in the hippocampus while deactivating Akt and CaMKII- alpha. Nanocurcumin reduced caspase-3 cleavage to a non-significant level compared to control group and restored Akt and CaMKII- alpha within the hippocampus while natural curcumin exerted no significant effect. These findings might suggest that nanocurcumin can restore memory deficit, hippocampal apoptosis as well as Akt and CaMKII- alpha signaling disruption associated with brain insulin resistance.

AB  - Camellia oleifera (C. oleifera) is one of the four major woody oil-bearing crops in the world and has relatively high ecological, economic, and medicinal value. Its seeds undergo a series of complex physiological and biochemical changes during ripening, which is mainly manifested as the accumulation and transformation of certain metabolites closely related to oil quality, especially flavonoids and fatty acids. To obtain new insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms, a parallel analysis of the transcriptome and proteome profiles of C. oleifera seeds at different maturity levels was conducted using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) complemented with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) data. A total of 16,530 transcripts and 1228 proteins were recognized with significant differential abundances in pairwise comparisons of samples at various developmental stages. Among these, 317 were coexpressed with a poor correlation, and most were involved in metabolic processes, including fatty acid metabolism, alpha -linolenic acid metabolism, and glutathione metabolism. In addition, the content of total flavonoids decreased gradually with seed maturity, and the levels of fatty acids generally peaked at the fat accumulation stage; these results basically agreed with the regulation patterns of genes or proteins in the corresponding pathways. The expression levels of proteins annotated as upstream candidates of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and chalcone synthase (CHS) as well as their cognate transcripts were positively correlated with the variation in the flavonoid content, while shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT)-encoding genes had the opposite pattern. The increase in the abundance of proteins and mRNAs corresponding to alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was associated with a reduction in linoleic acid synthesis. Using weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), we further identified six unique modules related to flavonoid, oil, and fatty acid anabolism that contained hub genes or proteins similar to transcription factors (TFs), such as MADS intervening keratin-like and C-terminal (MIKC_MADS), type-B authentic response regulator (ARR-B), and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH). Finally, based on the known metabolic pathways and WGCNA combined with the correlation analysis, five coexpressed transcripts and proteins composed of cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenases (CADs), caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT), flavonol synthase (FLS), and 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL) were screened out. With this exploratory multiomics dataset, our results presented a dynamic picture regarding the maturation process of C. oleifera seeds on Hainan Island, not only revealing the temporal specific expression of key candidate genes and proteins but also providing a scientific basis for the genetic improvement of this tree species.

AB  - Introduction: Invasive and superficial fungal infections are increasingly reported in Algeria, testifying to the increase in their frequency in parallel with the increase in risk factors and the availability of diagnostic means, at least in university hospitals (CHU). The latter, located in the major northern cities, are equipped with high-performance diagnostic tools compared to hospitals in the interior of the country.Methods: A comprehensive search of published and grey literature was undertaken. Prevalence and incidence of discrete fungal diseases were estimated using a deterministic modelling approach based on populations at risk. Population (2021) and major underlying disease risk groups were obtained from UNAIDS, WHO Tuberculosis and the international transplant registries as well as published data for asthma and COPD. The health service profile was summarised from national documentation.Results: Among the 43.6 million, including 12.9 million children, living in Algeria, the most prevalent fungal diseases are tinea capitis (>1.5 million), recurrent vaginal candidiasis (>500,000) and allergic fungal lung and sinus disorders (>110,000) and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (>10,000). Life-threatening invasive fungal infection incidence includes 774 Pneumocystis pneumonia in AIDS, 361 cryptococcal meningitis, 2272 candidaemia and 2639 invasive aspergillosis cases. Fungal keratitis probably affects >6000 eyes each year.Conclusions: Fungal infections are underestimated in Algeria because they are sought in patients with risk factors only after bacterial infections when they should be sought in parallel. The diagnosis is only accessible in hospitals in large cities and the work carried out in mycology is rarely published, making the estimation of the burden of these conditions difficult.

AB  - PremiseQuantifying how closely related plant species differ in susceptibility to insect herbivory is important for understanding the variation in evolutionary pressures on plant functional traits. However, empirically measuring in situ variation in herbivory spanning the geographic range of a plant-insect complex is logistically difficult. Recently, new methods have been developed using herbarium specimens to investigate patterns in plant-insect symbioses across large geographic scales. Such investigations provide insights into how accelerated anthropogenic changes may impact plant-insect interactions that are of ecological or agricultural importance. MethodsHere, we analyze 274 pressed herbarium samples to investigate variation in herbivory damage in 13 different species of the economically important plant genus Cucurbita (Cucurbitaceae). This collection is composed of specimens of wild, undomesticated Cucurbita that were collected from across their native range, and Cucurbita cultivars collected from both within their native range and from locations where they have been introduced for agriculture in temperate North America. ResultsHerbivory is common on individuals of all Cucurbita species collected throughout their geographic ranges. However, estimates of herbivory varied considerably among individuals, with mesophytic species accruing more insect damage than xerophytic species, and wild specimens having more herbivory than specimens collected from human-managed habitats. ConclusionsOur study suggests that long-term evolutionary changes in habitat from xeric to mesic climates and wild to human-managed habitats may mediate the levels of herbivory pressure from coevolved herbivores. Future investigations into the potential factors that contribute to herbivory may inform the management of domesticated crop plants and their insect herbivores.

AB  - The French voyage of exploration to New Holland (Australia) between 1800 and 1804, commanded by Nicolas Baudin (1754-1803), made substantial natural history collections, notably capturing dwarf emus from the two distinct populations on King Island (Ile King) in Bass Strait (December 1802) and Kangaroo Island (Ile Decres) (January 1803). Two of these emus survived their voyage to France, were housed briefly at the Empress Josephine's menagerie at Malmaison, and then the zoological park of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. Both died in 1822. With the wild populations on both islands exterminated soon after Baudin's visit, two watercolours, one by Charles-Alexandre Lesueur (1778-1846) and one by Leon de Wailly (fl. 1801-1824), have been central to the history of the dwarf emus. However, an important contemporary engraving by Nicolas Huet (1770-1830) depicting the two surviving emus in captivity has been overlooked. This essay explores the history of the images of the now extinct dwarf emus, as well as the production and significance of Huet's engraving.

AB  - Simple Summary Skull and jaw shape are critical to how an animal eats. The goal of this work was to examine how facial variation evolves and the genetic basis of these changes. We used two species of Lake Malawi cichlids with different facial shapes, one which has evolved to eat prey by suction feeding, a second that bites algae from rocks, as well as hybrid individuals generated by artificial mating of the two species. We found a series of changes in craniofacial structure including the shape of the lower jaw and throat region that impact how animals perform at suction feeding and biting. We then identified genetic regions that regulate these facial shapes. These genetic regions suggested that evolution of the senses, among other traits, may play an important role in facial evolution. Also, evolution of different parts of the face are controlled by distinct genetic regions. Despite this, cichlids that eat similar ways have similar facial shapes, suggesting that the function of jaw movement places certain limits on facial evolution in cichlid fishes. Overall, this work provides insights into how the face evolves, how these changes relate to feeding, and the genes and molecules that regulate craniofacial variation. Since Darwin, biologists have sought to understand the evolution and origins of phenotypic adaptations. The skull is particularly diverse due to intense natural selection on feeding biomechanics. We investigated the genetic and molecular origins of trophic adaptation using Lake Malawi cichlids, which have undergone an exemplary evolutionary radiation. We analyzed morphological differences in the lateral and ventral head shape among an insectivore that eats by suction feeding, an obligate biting herbivore, and their F-2 hybrids. We identified variation in a series of morphological traits-including mandible width, mandible length, and buccal length-that directly affect feeding kinematics and function. Using quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, we found that many genes of small effects influence these craniofacial adaptations. Intervals for some traits were enriched in genes related to potassium transport and sensory systems, the latter suggesting co-evolution of feeding structures and sensory adaptations for foraging. Despite these indications of co-evolution of structures, morphological traits did not show covariation. Furthermore, phenotypes largely mapped to distinct genetic intervals, suggesting that a common genetic basis does not generate coordinated changes in shape. Together, these suggest that craniofacial traits are mostly inherited as separate modules, which confers a high potential for the evolution of morphological diversity. Though these traits are not restricted by genetic pleiotropy, functional demands of feeding and sensory structures likely introduce constraints on variation. In all, we provide insights into the quantitative genetic basis of trophic adaptation, identify mechanisms that influence the direction of morphological evolution, and provide molecular inroads to craniofacial variation.

AB  - Simple Summary Small ruminants at the Mediterranean latitudes show a reproductive seasonality determining the seasonal availability of their production, resulting in problems for the marketing of these products. In order to better manage this crucial aspect, it is essential to study the genes that can influence seasonality. In different sheep breeds, polymorphisms at the melatonin receptor 1A (MTNR1A) gene are associated with an early reproductive recovery in spring, which is advantageous to shorten the anestrus period. Nevertheless, there are still shortcomings in the relationship between these polymorphisms and the reproductive activity, and if these mutations could influence the effectiveness of the ram introduction in the flock, based on different time periods, succeeding the seasonal anestrous. The present research evaluated the impact of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs430181568 and rs407388227 at the MTNR1A gene exon 2 on the resumption of reproductive activity in 240 ewes carrying different genotypes at these loci and submitted to different periods of ram introduction (February, March, April and May) in order to provide new information to stakeholders. Animals were divided into four groups (A-D) based on genotype and month of ram introduction. Fertility rate, distance from ram introduction to lambing and litter size were recorded in order to measure potential differences in crucial reproductive parameters based on different genotypes. The results confirmed the association between SNPs and reproductive recovery, with beneficial effects even in February and March, which are immediately subsequent to the photo-refractoriness period. The aim of the present research was to evaluate the association between the SNPs rs430181568 and rs407388227 located in the MTNR1A gene with the reproductive recovery of Sarda sheep in different months of ram introduction in the flock (February, March, April and May). In order to address this research gap, we selected two farms, each of which consisted of approximately 1000 animals; a total of 800 ewes (400 for each farm) were genotyped for the two single nucleotide polymorphisms rs430181568 and rs407388227 located in the exon 2 of the MTNR1A. These SNPs are completely linked; thus, each genotype of rs430181568 corresponded to the same genotype for rs407388227. Among the genotyped animals, 240 individuals were selected and divided into four homogeneous groups (A, B, C and D) of 60 subjects, each group based on age (range 3-6 years old), body condition score (BCS) (range 2.0-4.0) and genotype (20 ewes carrying CC/CC, 20 CT/CT and 20 TT/TT genotype). The dates of the ram introduction in each group were 15 February, 15 March, 15 April and 15 May, respectively. In all groups, the lambing date and the number of lambs born from 150 to 220 days after the ram introduction were recorded. In all the groups, the genotypes CC/CC and CT/CT of the polymorphism (rs430181568 and rs407388227) showed the greatest fertility (the ratio between the number of lambed ewes and the ewes exposed to the rams) (p < 0.01) and the shortest distance between ram introduction to lambing (p < 0.01), compared with the TT/TT genotype. In conclusion, we determined that the polymorphisms rs430181568 and rs407388227 were associated with reproductive recovery, after ram introduction, even in February and March, months subsequent to the photorefractoriness period.

AB  - Diving patterns of air-breathing predators were monitored from three moored subsurface upward-looking echosounders. Complete and partial dive profiles were visible on active acoustic records as echoes that started and/or returned to the surface. Dive metrics: maximum dive depths, durations, and wiggle count were measured and angles, distances, and velocities, were calculated at each site. Dive shapes 'U', 'V' and 'W' were derived using the number of wiggles and the percentage of dive bottom time. Dive profiles were classified into four types with type 1 dives being short in total duration and distance, low velocities, small angles, shallow, and linked to 'U' and 'W' shapes. Type 2 dives were short in distance, had low velocities, shallow depths, and were linked to 'V' dives. Dive types 3 and 4 had higher velocities, larger angles, longer total durations, and were deeper than types 1 and 2. Observed dive types could correspond to travelling, exploring, and foraging predator behaviors. Significant predator-prey overlaps occurred with predator dive profile counts correlated with krill aggregation thickness, density, and depth. This study demonstrates the utility of using stationary active acoustics to identify predator dive profiles with a simultaneous characterization of the potential prey field.

AB  - Introduction: Transcription factor EB (TFEB), a key regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, has diverse roles in various physiological processes. Enhancing lysosomal function by TFEB activation has recently been implicated in restoring neural stem cells (NSCs) function. Overexpression of TFEB can inhibit the cell cycle of newborn cortical NSCs. It has also been found that TFEB regulates the pluripotency transcriptional network in mouse embryonic stem cells independent of autophagy lysosomal biogenesis. This study aims to explore the effects of TFEB activation on neurogenesis in vivo through transgenic mice. Methods: We developed a GFAP-driven TFEB overexpression mouse model (TFEB GoE) by crossing the floxed TFEB overexpression mice and hGFAP-cre mice. We performed immunohistochemical and fluorescence staining on brain tissue from newborn mice to assess neurogenesis changes, employing markers such as GFAP, Nestin, Ki67, DCX, Tbr1 and Neun to trace different stages of neural development and cell proliferation. Results: TFEB GoE mice exhibited premature mortality, dying at 10-20 days after birth. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significant abnormalities, including disrupted hippocampal structure and cortical layering. Compared to control mice, TFEB GoE mice showed a marked increase in radial glial cells (RGCs) in the hippocampus and cortex, with Ki67 staining indicating these cells were predominantly in a quiescent state. This suggests that TFEB overexpression suppresses RGCs proliferation. Additionally, abnormal distributions of migrating neurons and mature neurons were observed, highlighted by DCX, Tbr1 and Neun staining, indicating a disruption in normal neurogenesis. Conclusion: This study, using transgenic animals in vivo, revealed that GFAP-driven TFEB overexpression leads to abnormal neural layering in the hippocampus and cortex by dysregulating neurogenesis. Our study is the first to discover the detrimental impact of TFEB overexpression on neurogenesis during embryonic development, which has important reference significance in future TFEB overexpression interventions in NSCs for treatment.

AB  - Simple Summary Over the past three decades, sows' litter sizes have been increased to improve productivity, but have also led to increased proportions of (very) low birth weight piglets, and consequently, higher pre-weaning mortality. One possible intervention to counter the increased mortality is supplementing a milk replacer. This study aimed to determine if the performance of low birth weight piglets can be improved by drenching a dense, concentrated milk replacer and whether the frequency of drenching and the severity of the low birth weight played a role. Secondly, this study compared the supplementation of the same milk replacer at two farms with different perinatal management. No effect of drenching a dense milk replacer on the survival or performance of (very) low birth weight piglets was observed, regardless of farm and, apparently, of the applied management. However, mortality rates were lower at the farm with a higher level of perinatal management, suggesting that high-quality care might have more effect on the survival of small piglets than drenching a dense milk replacer. Introducing hyperprolific sows has led to proportionally more (very) low birth weight ((V)LBW) piglets, accompanied by higher mortality. To improve the survival of (V)LBW piglets, drenching a dense milk replacer (DMR) could be applied. A first experiment evaluated the effect of drenching DMR (1 or 3 doses within 24 h after birth) to LBW ((mean litter birth weight - 1*SD) and weighing between 1 kg and 750 g) and VLBW piglets ((mean litter birth weight - 1.5*SD) and weighing less than 750 g). On days 1, 2, 3, 9, and two days post-weaning, body weight, growth, skin lesions, and mortality were monitored. No effect of DMR was observed on any of the parameters. In a second experiment, LBW piglets were supplemented with DMR (similarly to experiment 1) at two farms differing in the level of perinatal care. The same parameters were evaluated, and again none were affected by drenching DMR. Overall survival of the LBW piglets was significantly higher at the farm with high perinatal care. It can be concluded that good perinatal management is more effective in enhancing the survival of LBW piglets than drenching.

AB  - Lead (Pb) toxicity, through ingestion of lead ammunition in carcasses, is a threat to scavenging birds worldwide, but has received little attention in Australia. We analyzed lead exposure in the wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax), the largest raptor species found in mainland Australia and a facultative scavenger. Eagle carcasses were collected opportunistically throughout south-eastern mainland Australia between 1996 and 2022. Lead concentrations were measured in bone samples from 62 animals via portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Lead was detected (concentration >1 ppm) in 84% (n = 52) of the bone samples. The mean lead concentration of birds in which lead was detected was 9.10 ppm (& PLUSMN;SE 1.66). Bone lead concentrations were elevated (10-20 ppm) in 12.9% of samples, and severe (>20 ppm) in 4.8% of samples. These proportions are moderately higher than equivalent data for the same species from the island of Tasmania, and are comparable to data from threatened eagle species from other continents. Lead exposure at these levels is likely to have negative impacts on wedge-tailed eagles at the level of the individual and perhaps at a population level. Our results suggest that studies of lead exposure in other Australian avian scavenger species are warranted.

AB  - Introduction: Neuro-navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left angular gyrus has been broadly investigated for the treatment of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Although abnormalities in two hippocampal networks, the anterior -temporal (AT) and posterior -medial (PM) networks, are consistent with aMCI and are potential therapeutic targets for rTMS, the underlying mechanisms of the therapeutic effects of rTMS on hippocampal network connections remain unknown. Here, we assessed the impact of left angular gyrus rTMS on activity in these networks and explored whether the treatment response was due to the distance between the clinically applied target (the group average optimal site) and the personalized target in patients with aMCI. Methods: Sixty subjects clinically diagnosed with aMCI participated in this study after 20 sessions of shamcontrolled rTMS targeting the left angular gyrus. Resting -state functional magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological assessments were performed before and after rTMS. Functional connectivity alterations in the PM and AT networks were assessed using seed -based functional connectivity analysis and two -factor repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). We then computed the correlations between the functional connectivity changes and clinical rating scales. Finally, we examined whether the Euclidean distance between the clinically applied and personalized targets predicted the subsequent treatment response. Results: Compared with the sham group, the active rTMS group showed rTMS-induced deactivation of functional connectivity within the medial temporal lobe -AT network, with a negative correlation with episodic memory score changes. Moreover, the active rTMS lowers the interdependency of changes in the PM and AT networks. Finally, the Euclidean distance between the clinically applied and personalized target distances could predict subsequent network lever responses in the active rTMS group. Conclusions: Neuro-navigated rTMS selectively modulates widespread functional connectivity abnormalities in the PM and AT hippocampal networks in aMCI patients, and the modulation of hippocampal-AT network connectivity can efficiently reverse memory deficits. The results also highlight the necessity of personalized targets for fMRI.

AB  - Invasive aspergillosis is a rare but severe fungal infection primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals. The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has introduced new complexities in managing aspergillosis due to the widespread use of corticosteroids for treating COVID-19-related respiratory distress, which can increase susceptibility to fungal infections. Here, we present a challenging case of progressive cerebral aspergillosis complicated by cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) in a 67-year-old male with a history of COVID-19. The patient, initially misdiagnosed with temporal arteritis, received pulse corticosteroid therapy twice before presenting with persistent left-sided headaches and vision loss. Cranial imaging revealed findings consistent with fungal sinusitis, Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, and orbital pseudotumor, which progressed despite initial antifungal therapy. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging indicated an invasive mass extending into the left cavernous sinus and other intracranial structures, raising suspicion of aspergillosis. A transsphenoidal biopsy confirmed Aspergillus infection, leading to voriconazole therapy. Despite aggressive treatment, follow-up imaging revealed significant progression, with extension to the right frontal region and left cavernous sinus. The patient then developed visual impairment in the right eye and was diagnosed with CST secondary to fungal sinusitis. Management included a combination of systemic antifungals and antibiotics; however, the patient declined surgical intervention. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges and rapid progression associated with cerebral aspergillosis in post-COVID-19 patients treated with corticosteroids. This report highlights the need for heightened clinical suspicion and prompt, targeted interventions in similar cases to improve patient outcomes. Further research is required to understand the optimal management of invasive fungal infections.

AB  - Premise Cleistogamous species constitute interesting study systems to resolve the longstanding question of how outcrossing is maintained given that seed production is ensured through selfing. In this work, we investigate the selective forces that allow the persistence of producing self-pollinated cleistogamous (CL) and chasmogamous (CH) flowers in Viola jaubertiana Mares & Vigin. Methods We monitored three populations at different elevation for two years, and studied the flowering phenology and the relative contribution of each flower morph to parental fitness. We tested whether allocation to CH and CL flowers differed across populations and if it covaried with herbivory and water stress conditions. We also performed hand-pollination and bagging experiments in CH flowers to estimate inbreeding depression and heterosis. Results The CH flowers open in winter under unfavorable conditions for pollination, show high pollen limitation and no-delayed selfing, and thus produce a low amount of seeds. Conversely, CL flowers appear in early spring, are physiologically cheaper to produce (i.e., dry weight is 3.4 times lower than that of CH flowers), and yield approximately 100 times more seeds than CH flowers. The CH flowers were favored under water stress and low herbivory. Crosses between populations showed up to 25% greater fitness than those within populations. Conclusions Despite the great pollen limitation in CH flowers, we suggest that the interaction among different environmental determinants and heterosis are probably sufficient forces to maintain chasmogamy in this long-lived species, reducing deleterious fixed mutations in the selfed lines.

AB  - We recently developed a combination of four chemiluminescence-based assays for selective detection of different nitric oxide (NO) metabolites, including nitrite, S-nitrosothiols (SNOs), heme-nitrosyl (heme-NO), and dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs). However, these NO species (NOx) may be under dynamic equilibria during sample handling, which affects the final determination made from the readout of assays. Using fetal and maternal sheep from low and high altitudes (300 and 3801 m, respectively) as models of different NOx levels and compositions, we tested the hypothesis that sample handling introduces artifacts in chemiluminescence assays of NOx. Here, we demonstrate the following: (1) room temperature placement is associated with an increase and decrease in NOx in plasma and whole blood samples, respectively; (2) snap freezing and thawing lead to the interconversion of different NOx in plasma; (3) snap freezing and homogenization in liquid nitrogen eliminate a significant fraction of NOx in the aorta of stressed animals; (4) A "stop solution" commonly used to preserve nitrite and SNOs leads to the interconversion of different NOx in blood, while deproteinization results in a significant increase in detectable NOx; (5) some reagents widely used in sample pretreatments, such as mercury chloride, acid sulfanilamide, N-ethylmaleimide, ferricyanide, and anticoagulant ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, have unintended effects that destabilize SNO, DNICs, and/or heme-NO; (6) blood, including the residual blood clot left in the washed purge vessel, quenches the signal of nitrite when using ascorbic acid and acetic acid as the purge vessel reagent; and (7) new limitations to the four chemiluminescence-based assays. This study points out the need for re-evaluation of previous chemiluminescence measurements of NOx, and calls for special attention to be paid to sample handling, as it can introduce significant artifacts into NOx assays.

AB  - Current antipsychotics have limited effects on the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia patients, therefore, cognitive remediation has been applied to schizophrenia patients to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction. However, the neurobiological mechanisms of cognitive training programs have not been well studied because established animal models are not suitable or because repetitive training has not been introduced in such animal models. In the present study, we employed Toll-like receptor 2 knockout (TLR2 KO) mouse as a schizophrenia mouse model and evaluated the effects of repetitive training as cognitive remediation therapy for schizophrenia. TLR2 KO mice could fully learn the Barnes maze paradigm through repetitive training to improve memory retrieval and reversal learning ability, although the learning speed was slower than that of wild-type (WT) animals. In addition, highly repetitive training activated the neuronal cells in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampal CA3 and hippocampal DG regions of TLR2 KO mice, similar to WT mice. These results indicated that TLR2 KO mouse would be a useful tool for studying the neumbiological mechanisms of cognitive remediation in schizophrenia.

AB  - IntroductionChronic ethanol intake has been found to favor hippocampal deterioration and alter neuronal morphological maturation; resveratrol has been suggested as an antioxidant that may counteract these effects. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of resveratrol on oxidative stress markers, endogenous antioxidant system in the hippocampus, and the behavior of male Wistar rats administered different concentrations of ethanol.MethodsThe animals, at 3 months old, were randomly distributed into 11 study groups (n = 6/group), orally administered (5 days on, 2 days off) with water (control), ethanol (10, 20, 30, 40 or 50%), or ethanol (10, 20, 30, 40 or 50%) plus resveratrol (10 mg/Kg/day) for 2 months. Subsequently, the production of nitrites, malondialdehyde, and 4-hydroxy-alkenal (HNE) and the enzymatic activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were quantified.ResultsThe levels of nitric oxide and lipid peroxidation products were significantly increased in each ethanol concentration and were statistically different compared to the control group; however, resveratrol significantly reduced oxidative stress caused by high ethanol concentration. The SOD and CAT did not present significant changes with respect to the controls in any of the study groups. In the different concentrations of ethanol used, GR increases significantly in the groups administered with resveratrol but not GPx. Resveratrol was shown to maintain the results similar to the control at most ethanol concentrations.DiscussionOur results suggest that resveratrol prevents oxidative stress induced by ethanol in the hippocampus by decreasing cellular lipid peroxidation, but does not prevent the activation of catalase or SOD enzymes; however, allows glutathione to be kept active and in adequate concentrations in its reduced form and avoids alterations in the locomotor system.

AB  - Mammals that live in groups play critical roles in ecosystems and are significant conservation and management targets. However, efficiently and reliably estimating both the number of groups and group sizes for monitoring their population status presents challenges. Point-count surveys, such as camera trapping, face difficulties in estimating these variables because multiple groups are detected repeatedly at the same observation station. In such cases, the observed group sizes should conform to finite mixture distributions-that is, probability distributions with varying parameters may be combined, and the number of distributions involved remains uncertain. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to simultaneously estimate these variables while accounting for imperfect detection based on point-count survey data. Specifically, we extend the N-mixture model to estimate group size by introducing a mixture structure for each group observation using a truncated stick-breaking (TSB) prior. Additionally, by incorporating the Royle-Nichols model as a sub-model, we estimate the number of potentially detectable clusters at a given point, enabling effective truncation of the prior distribution for cluster assignment probability by the TSB prior. Monte Carlo simulations revealed that while the conventional N-mixture model overestimated group sizes by 56.1%, the mixture models using TSB prior reduced this bias to - 5.2%. Further inclusion of information from the Royle-Nichols model improved accuracy, resulting in a minimal bias of + 0.6% in group size estimates. The estimation of the number of groups showed a 35.0% positive bias when using the TSB prior alone but incorporating auxiliary information by the RN model reduced this bias to - 2.1%. Using a random walk model that simulated movements of group-living animals, we demonstrated that our model provided robust group size estimates even under model misspecification, when the individual detection probability exceeded 0.5 and mortality remained below 13%. The model slightly underestimated the number of groups but maintained acceptable accuracy. Field surveys using camera trap data from juvenile wild boars yielded satisfactory goodness of fit. Our model is robust to changes in group membership during surveys, offering an underlying structure for future refinement to address more realistic situations.

AB  - Salinity is the most important abiotic stress factor that negatively affects agricultural produc-tion and quality. It necessitates a wider introduction of resistant species and the development of high-yielding varieties, especially in salinity-affected areas. Camelina is a plant that has an effective structure against abiotic stress factors. The research was carried out to determine the physiological and chemical changes caused by different salt concentrations in the camelina plant, and the salt concentration to which camelina is most sensitive. The research was carried out in greenhouse conditions. PI-650142 camelina genotype was used as the plant material, and 6 different NaCl concentrations (0, 35, 70, 140, 210 and 200 mM) were used as salt treat-ment. Plant height, leaf area, plant water content, relative water content, membrane permea-bility, amount of chlorophyll and carotenoids and biomass accumulation were evaluated. As a result, it was found that the applied NaCl doses showed significant differences on all the parameters evaluated. It has been determined that plants can tolerate salt stress up to 140 mM NaCl concentration, and there were serious negative changes in plant height, the weight of plant parts that make up the biomass, total biomass, leaf parameters and membrane permeability above the 140 mM NaCl concentration. These findings reveal that up to a certain level (140 mM NaCl concentration) in regions with salt stress, the camelina plant can be grown without encountering a serious problem in terms of morphological and physiological adaptation mechanisms.

AB  - Introduction Camellia reticulata holds cultural and horticultural significance in traditional Chinese gardens, as a regional endemic species in Yunnan Province. However, during the in vitro regeneration process of C. reticulata, there is often a phenomenon of low efficiency of adventitious bud differentiation or no adventitious bud differentiation at all.Methods In previous study, we observed significant morphological differences between the callus tissues of C. reticulata 'Zipao' and wild species. The callus of 'Zipao' was white and loosely textured, the wild species was green and hard. To investigate the differences between these two types of callus, we conducted transcriptome analysis and identified a differentially expressed gene GST24, which is closely related to the synthesis of glutathione (GSH). Heterologous transformation of CrGST24 into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) was conducted.Results and discussion The CrGST24 gene promoted the synthesis of endogenous auxin and cytokinin in transgenic tobacco by regulating the expression of transcription factors related to auxin and cytokinin. Exogenous IBA, 6-BA, and red-blue light treatment increased the levels of auxins and cytokinins in C. reticulata callus, thereby promoting adventitious bud differentiation. Additionally, CrGST24 interacted with CrGSHB and CrDHAR2 genes, facilitating GSH and AsA synthesis and clearing ROS.

AB  - IntroductionThe presence of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) in neonates triggers a strong neuroinflammatory reaction. Pyroptosis, a programmed cell death mechanism associated with inflammation, plays a crucial role in HIBD. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) plays a significant role in connecting metabolic processes and inflammatory responses, but whether it affects hippocampus pyroptosis in HIBD is unclear. The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of PKM2 in HIBD and to propose a novel therapeutic approach for neonatal ischemic-hypoxic encephalopathy.MethodsIn this study, we employed neonatal 7-day-old Sprague Dawley rats to establish a model of HIBD using the Rice-Vannucci surgical technique and a hypoxia device. To inhibit the elevation of PKM2, we utilized the PKM2 inhibitor shikonin. The rats were categorized into four groups: Sham, Shikonin, HIBD, and Shikonin + HIBD. Behavioral tests, hematoxylin eosin staining, immunofluorescence staining, ELISA (IL-1 beta, IL-18), and LDH were conducted in each group to evaluate neurological function, hippocampal damage, the occurrence of neuronal pyroptosis, and the neuroinflammation. Western blot was used to assess the expression levels of PKM2, NLRP3, Caspase-1, Cleaved Caspase-1, GSDMD, GSDMDN, and IL-1 beta.ResultsThe expression of PKM2 elevated in hippocampal tissues of the HIBD model and the localization of PKM2 in the hippocampus was activated in neurons instead of microglia during the HIBD. Meanwhile, the inhibition of PKM2 improved the behavioral test scores and the body weight of rats, the neuronal damage in the CA1 region of hippocampal tissue was also attenuated. In addition, inhibiting PKM2 alleviated neuronal pyroptosis by decreasing the expression of PKM2, NLRP3, Caspase-1, Cleaved Caspase-1, GSDMD, GSDMDN. Furthermore, serum levels of LDH and inflammatory factors IL-1 beta and IL-18 decrease with PKM2 inhibition.ConclusionsBased on these findings, we can conclude that PKM2 plays a crucial role in regulating hippocampal neuronal pyroptosis of HIBD rats via NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD pathway. Therefore, inhibiting PKM2 could be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neonatal ischemic-hypoxic encephalopathy.

AB  - Sympatric host-associated genetic differentiation is a prominent pattern that could lead to speciation. In insects, there are numerous examples of host-associated differentiation among herbivores that prefer different plants, and parasitoids that prefer different hosts, but few examples for specialist predators. We developed new microsatellite loci for two species of silver fly, Leucotaraxis argenticollis (Zetterstedt) and L. piniperda (Malloch) (Diptera: Chamaemyiidae), being evaluated as biological control agents for the hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae Annand (Hemiptera: Adelgidae), in eastern North America where it is a nonnative pest. We obtained DNA from specimens of both fly species feeding on native A. tsugae in western North America, as well as on other western and eastern adelgid species. We performed population genetic analyses using the new loci and DNA barcode sequences. Our results confirmed east-west allopatric divergence and uncovered nested genetic differentiation associated with different adelgid prey species and their host plants in western North America for both species of silver flies. For both species, there is also evidence for a longer history of diversification in the west, with ancestral specialization of feeding on pine adelgids, which was retained after range expansion to the east. More recently, divergence to feeding on new adelgid prey species occurred in the west. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that host-alternating life cycles in Adelgidae may provide temporary escape from specialist predators. We discuss the implications for biological control efficacy and potential for lineage hybridization as western flies are released in the east to control A. tsugae.

AB  - Invasive plants from their native and introduced ranges differ in their interactions with herbivores but it is not known whether they also vary in their interactions with herbivore natural enemies. Here, we used olfactometer bioassays and cage experiments to investigate how foraging behaviors of 2 parasitoid and 1 hyperparasitoid species depended on plant population origin. Triadica sebifera (Euphorbiaceae) is native to China but invasive in the United States. In China, it is fed on by a specialist noctuid Gadirtha fusca (Lepidoptera: Nolidae), which hosts a parasitoid Apanteles sp. (Hymenoptera: Microgastinae) and hyperparasitoid (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae) plus a generalist aphid Toxoptera odinae (Homoptera: Aphidiidae) parasitized by Lysiphlebus confusus (Hymenoptera: Aphidiinae). Both parasitoids preferred plants infested by their host over herbivore-free plants in olfactometer bioassays. Apanteles sp. and Eurytomid wasps preferred G. fusca infested plants from China populations over those from US populations in olfactometer bioassays but L. confusus wasps did not discriminate between T. odinae infested plants from China vs. US populations. Similarly, G. fusca caterpillars on China population plants were more likely to be parasitized than ones on US population plants when they were in the same cage but odds of parasitism for T. odinae did not differ for those on China vs. US population plants. These results suggest that populations from the native and introduced ranges may differ in traits that impact higher trophic levels. This may have implications for successful control of invasive plants as biocontrol agents are introduced or herbivores begin to feed on them in their introduced ranges.

AB  - The problem of human-elephant conflict (HEC) now appears to be one of the greatest challenges in the forest-based mouzas of West Bengal as well as in India. As per the field survey from 2018-2019 to 2020-2021, a total of 277 (16.55%) and 920 (4.21%) mouzas were identified as HEC-affected out of 1674 and 21,832 recognized mouzas in Northern and Southern parts of West Bengal, respectively. Here, the destruction of crops, huts, death and injury of human, livestocks, and even elephants have been increased year after year. Crop-raiding incident is the most common problem among all that occurs during the milky stage and harvesting stage of paddy. Numerous studies have been carried out showing the pattern of HEC incident in some areas of West Bengal, but none of them have tried to identify the HEC risk depending upon crop-raiding incident in this state. Here, it has been tried to examine the mouza-wise HEC risk based on crop-raiding incident in the stated two parts of West Bengal. Two important parameters, the number of crop fields raided and the total number of crop fields present but not raided, were taken into consideration to measure the HEC risk. The result shows that the Jhargram (0.75-0.98), Medinipur (0.68-0.89), and Rupnarayan (0.68-0.89) forest divisions are the highest HEC risk areas in West Bengal. The most dominant factor as determined from the principal component analysis is the lack of fodder and other biological requirements that are one of the basic needs for survival of the elephants within the forest (0.864). The total risk for raiding crop is 3.21 and 2.93 in the two parts of West Bengal. Here, the paddy and vegetables fields are more prone to be raided. Moreover, descriptive statistics were also used to explain the patterns of crop-raiding incidents. The findings may provide a way out for the sustainable management of HEC risk like establishment of micro-habitat, creation of elephant proof trench/electric fences, and rapid plantation of indigenous plant species in the vacant forest areas, thereby helping the policymakers in wildlife conservation.

AB  - Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertner (variegated thistle, milk thistle) is one of the worst weeds of hill country pasture in the east coast regions of New Zealand. As part of an initial investigation into the potential for biocontrol, a survey of the phytophagous insects associated with S. marianum in New Zealand was carried out at 16 populations from 29 November to 16 December 2021. Phytophagous associations were determined by collecting insects on the plant and by seedhead dissections. The species collected were grouped into three categories: 'specialists', 'generalists', and 'tourists' that comprised 27.4%, 66.3%, and 6.3% of the total number of specimens collected, respectively. The specialist group was almost entirely comprised of the seedhead weevil, Rhinocyllus conicus (Fr & ouml;lich). While adults of R. conicus were commonly collected on variegated thistle, only 6.5% of seedheads contained larvae of the weevil, indicating that S. marianum is not a common developmental host. Generalist species commonly collected on S. marianum included: Nysius caledoniae Distant, Rhypodes clavicornis (F.), Closterotomus norwegicus (Gmelin) and Nezara virdula (L.). Overall, the field surveys document low levels of attack from generalist herbivores and minimal attack by the specialist weevil, R. conicus. Vacant niches are present on the weed in New Zealand, providing a strong case for introducing specialised biocontrol agents.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the relationship between body condition score (BCS) and reproductive recovery in Sarda dairy breed ewes, as well as its association with some hematochemical parameters, focusing on the male effect as a method to induce out-of-season ovulation. The male effect is commonly used in sheep farming as an alternative to hormonal treatments, but its success can be influenced by factors such as BCS. In this experiment, 200 healthy lactating ewes (aged 3-5 years) were divided into four groups based on BCS (2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5). BCS was measured on a 1-5 scale by touching the amounts of muscling and fat deposition in the loin region. On 15 May, 10 rams of proven fertility were introduced, and removed 50 days later. Blood samples were collected at days 15, 30, and 50 for glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, total protein, and albumin analysis, along with BCS evaluations. Lambing dates, fertility rates, litter size, and the time from ram introduction to lambing were recorded. The results showed that ewes with a higher BCS (3.0 and 3.5) had improved fertility rates, earlier lambing, and a better overall reproductive performance compared to ewes with a lower BCS (2.0 and 2.5). Higher BCS groups also exhibited higher levels of glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. The study concluded that a BCS of 3.0 is optimal for reproductive efficiency in Sarda ewes during the male effect in spring, promoting better reproductive outcomes and animal welfare without the need for hormonal treatments.

AB  - The Mexican rice borer, Eoreuma loftini (Dyar), is an invasive herbivore that attacks many gramineous host plants. The species is an economic pest of several grass crops in North America including sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), rice (Oryza sativa), corn (Zea mays), and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). The species was first detected in the United States in 1980 and has since expanded its range eastward along the Gulf Coast reaching Louisiana in 2008. A disjointed introduction was detected in Florida in 2012, though range expansion of this population within the state has been limited. Most recently, a separate introduction was detected along the Atlantic coast of Georgia near the South Carolina border (32.19884 degrees N, 81.35894 degrees W). Larvae were collected from sugarcane in 2020 and 2021 and identified as E. loftini. The identification was confirmed with genetic analysis showing >99% similarity with most mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) sequences of known E. loftini. This is the furthest north and east of any established population in North America. Potential routes of introduction and impacts to crop production along the U.S. Atlantic Coast are discussed.

AB  - Poor sleep quality is associated with age-related cognitive decline, and whether reversal of these alterations is possible is unknown. In this study, we report how sleep deprivation (SD) affects hippocampal representations, sleep patterns, and memory in young and old mice. After training in a hippocampus-dependent object-place recognition (OPR) task, control animals sleep ad libitum, although experimental animals undergo 5 h of SD, followed by recovery sleep. Young controls and old SD mice exhibit successful OPR memory, whereas young SD and old control mice are impaired. Successful performance is associated with two cellular phenotypes: (1) "context'' cells, which remain stable throughout training and testing, and (2) "object configuration'' cells, which remap when objects are introduced to the context and during testing. Additionally, effective memory correlates with spindle counts during non-rapid eye movement (NREM)/rapid eye movement (REM) sigma transitions. These results suggest SD may serve to ameliorate age-related memory deficits and allow hippocampal representations to adapt to changing environments.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The banker plant system may provide an effective and economical method for long-term suppression of insect pests. We developed a non-crop banker plant system aiming to improve the control of stick tea thrips Dendrothrips minowai in tea plantations. In this system, we used the polyphagous predator Orius strigicollis (Poppius) as the biocontrol agent, the black bean aphid Aphis fabae (Scopoli) as an alternative food, and the faba bean Vicia faba L. as the banker plant to support the predator in controlling pest thrips. Laboratory tests revealed that the control efficacy of the banker plant system was higher than that of directly releasing O. strigicollis. These results indicate that this banker plant system may be used in the field to provide a more effective and economical way to control pest thrips in tea plantations compared with the direct release of O. strigicollis.
   The stick tea thrip Dendrothrips minowai (Priesner) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) is a destructive pest in tea plantations in south and southwest China. To control this pest, a non-crop banker plant system was developed using a polyphagous predator Orius strigicollis (Poppius) (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) with the black bean aphid Aphis fabae (Scopoli) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) as an alternative prey and the faba bean Vicia faba as the banker plant to support the predator in targeting the pest. The fitness of A. fabae on tea plants and faba bean was evaluated to determine its host specificity. Moreover, the control efficacy of the banker plant system on D. minowai on tea plants was tested in the laboratory and compared with that of direct release of O. strigicollis. The experiments showed that faba bean was an excellent non-crop host for A. fabae because, while the aphid population increased quickly on faba bean, it could only survive for up to 9 days on tea plants. Compared with direct release of O. strigicollis, lower densities of pest were observed when introducing the banker plant system. Our results indicate that this banker plant system has the potential to be implemented in the field to improve the control of the pest thrips.

AB  - Neurogenesis encompasses the formation and development of neurons in the mammalian brain, mainly occurring in hippocampus and the olfactory system. This process is rapid, accurate, and very sensitive to the external stressors including environment, diet, age, anxiety, stress, depression, diet, and hormones. The range of stressors is big and directly impacts the generation, maturation and migration, efficacy, and myelination of the neuronal cells. The field of regenerative medicine focuses on combating the direct or indirect effects of these stressors on the process of neurogenesis, and ensures increased general and neuronal communications and functioning. Understanding the deep secrets of brain signaling and devising ways to increase drug availability is tough, considering the complexity and intricate details of the neuronal networks and signaling in the CNS. It is imperative to understand this complexity and introduce potent and efficacious ways to combat diseases. This perspective offers an insight into how neurogenesis could be aided by nanotechnology and what plausible nanomaterials are available to culminate neurogenesis-related neurological disorders. The nanomaterials are promising as they are minute, robust, and effective and help in diagnostics and therapeutics such as drug delivery, maturation and neuroprotection, neurogenesis, imaging, and neurosurgery.

AB  - Introduction: Antenatal steroid (ANS) therapy accelerates preterm lung maturation. Clinical and experimental data show current regimens disrupt placental function and transport and impact fetal growth. We have previously shown that higher materno-fetal steroid exposures increase fetal glucocorticoid clearance. Using a sheep model, we aimed to determine whether: (i) placental transcriptomic changes correlate with fetal glucocorticoid exposure; (ii) these changes persist below the threshold for lung maturation; and (iii) transcriptomic changes explain altered steroid clearance and fetal growth. Methods: This secondary analysis included singleton fetuses delivered at 123 +/- 1 days' gestation (n = 6/group), ventilated for 30-min, then euthanized. Fetuses received a 48-h infusion targeting plasma betamethasone levels of 2, 1, or 0.5 ng/mL, a control group received saline. Placental tissue was collected for RNA sequencing, fetal liver for qPCR and betamethasone concentrations were measured by LCMS. Results: Maximal lung maturation occurred at 2 ng/mL. Placental transcriptome changes were dose-dependent, with 2052, 408, and 498 differentially expressed genes in the 2, 1, and 0.5 ng/mL groups, respectively. KEGG analysis showed suppression of DNA replication, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and cell cycle (p < 0.001), and activation of steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways, including upregulation of UGT1A4 and CYP17A1. Placental transporters SLC4A10, SLC7A3, SLC36A3, SLC46A1 and SLC6A3 were downregulated at 2 ng/mL. In the fetal liver, expression of transport protein ABCB1 increased across all treatment groups. Discussion: Placental transcriptomic disruption persisted at and below the ANS exposure necessary for lung maturation. These findings suggest placental involvement in both impaired fetal growth and steroid clearance and underscore the need to optimize ANS dosing.

AB  - Introduction: Drug metabolism during pregnancy is a complex process that involves maternal, placental and fetal sites of metabolism. Indeed, there is a lack of clarity provided from drug metabolism in human pregnancy due to ethical limitations. Large animal models of human pregnancy provide an opportunity to quantify activity of phase 1 drug metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in the maternal, placental, and fetal compartments. Herein, we have validated a comprehensive assay to quantify maternal, placental, and fetal CYP activity.Methods: Isolated microsomes from sheep maternal liver, placenta, and fetal liver (140d gestation, term = 150d) were incubated with CYP-specific probe drugs to quantify the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A. Inhibition studies were performed to validate specificity of probe drugs. The validated assay was developed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).Results: CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A were active in maternal liver. In contrast, only CYP1A2, CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 were active in the placenta, whereas CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 were active in the fetal liver. Of the placental-specific CYPs validated, CYP1A2 increased in type A compared with type D placentomes, whereas CYP2C8 activity increased in type B compared with type A and C.Discussion: This study has established conditions for compartment-specific CYP activity in the sheep maternalplacental-fetal unit using a validated and standardised experimental workflow. Compartment- and placentome type-specific CYP activity are important considerations when examining drug metabolism in the maternalplacental-fetal unit and in determining the impact of pregnancy complications.

AB  - The parrotfish Sparisoma cretense, a marine species native to the eastern and southern coastal areas of the Mediterranean, has extended its distribution northward. Here, we provide an update on its distribution based on currently published data and two new records from the coastline of Sardinia, Italy (central-western Mediterranean). The survey methods were scuba diving and spearfishing: one specimen of S. cretense was caught along the Argentiera coastline (northwest Mediterranean) and the others were photographed in the Gulf of Orosei, Osalla Bay (central-eastern Mediterranean). A literature update, together with new records, documents the distribution of this species in the northernmost areas of the Mediterranean. Probably a result of global warming, the ongoing northward expansion of S. cretense highlights the need for sampling campaigns to obtain timely updates on population and distribution of this thermophilic species.

AB  - For threatened species that occur across multi-use landscapes, a coordinated cross-tenure management approach is desirable to achieve long-term conservation outcomes. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the progress towards achieving conservation priorities for the greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis) in the Pilbara region of Western Australia (WA), and inform ongoing research and funding investment, we review a research program that has focused on the species over the past decade. Priorities were initially established at a stakeholder workshop in 2013, and research targeting key areas has greatly enhanced ecological knowledge of the bilby in the Pilbara and elsewhere in WA. Highlights include the development of a non-invasive scat DNA-based abundance monitoring technique, an improved understanding of habitat use and diet, including the importance of Acacia spp. that host root-dwelling larvae, and the threat posed by introduced predators. Proposed future research directions focus on better understanding habitat requirements and the association between key food resources and fire, evaluating genetic structure and gene flow at the landscape-scale and examining threat interactions. Management to mitigate a range of threats including introduced predators, grazing livestock/feral herbivores and fire is recommended, with consideration for an integrated approach.

FX  - We acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the Pilbara region of Western Australia on whose lands fauna conservation work was undertaken, as well as the many ranger groups for their partnership in these projects. We thank the Mugarinya Community Association and Yandeyarra Rangers, Nullagine Community School and members of the Warralong community for their assistance with bilby monitoring, field surveys and threat management within the Pilbara. The Pilbara Bilby Research Program (PBRP) was supported through offset funding from Fortescue Metals Group, Millennium Minerals and Roy Hill. The 2013 Bilby Workshop hosted by the then Department of Parks and Wildlife (now DBCA), was undertaken in collaboration with the then Department of Environment and sponsored by Aurizon and Buru Energy. DBCA has worked in partnership with universities and other stakeholders, including environmental consultancies, CSIRO and Traditional Owners to deliver the PBRP. This review is derived from a Departmental report, which was prepared for the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) (see Northover et al. 2023). A section of this report was also summarised in another Departmental report, also prepared for DWER (https://www.wa.gov.au/system/files/2023-08/summary-of-knowledge-for-six-faunal-species-that-are-mnes-in-the-pilbara_final-report.pdf). 'Guidelines for surveys to detect the presence of bilbies, and assess the importance of habitat in Western Australia' was prepared by DBCA in association with Richard Southgate (Envisage Environmental) and Mike Bamford (Bamford Consulting Ecologists). The standardised data sheet for 2-ha sign plot surveys was developed in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund and Environs Kimberley with advice from experts including Richard Southgate. Faecal samples obtained from Kanyana Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre were used to refine faecal DNA extraction methods and conduct DNA degradation trials. We would like to express our gratitude to those that have contributed to bilby recovery, either through their employment, student projects or volunteer involvement, with particular thanks to Frank Morris. We would also like to acknowledge the support of Rangelands NRM, Main Roads WA, Greening Australia and DBCA Karijini National Park Rangers for their assistance with logistics.

AB  - Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a mechanosensory protein that serves as a critical transcriptional coactivator involved in various cellular processes. Thus, the precise regulation of YAP is vital for effectively manipulating cellular functions. Despite small molecular inhibitors and siRNA being available, these approaches often fail to achieve precise and reversible regulation of YAP dynamics within complex biological systems. This often leads to suboptimal therapeutic results or collateral damage to healthy tissues. Here, we introduce a method for quantitative and reversible regulation of YAP through nanoparticle-mediated magnetothermal stimulation of F-actin, which is crucial for transmitting mechanical signals to YAP. We utilized actin-binding peptide-modified ultrasmall zinc-doped ferrite nanoparticles to specifically and effectively disrupt intracellular F-actin structures by generating localized heat upon exposure to an alternating magnetic field (AMF). In our in vitro studies, increasing the AMF intensity from 0 to 313 Oe led to a progressive deterioration of F-actin integrity, which was defined as Fint. Fint gradually decreased from 0.91 to 0.38 as the AMF intensity increased from 0 to 313 Oe. Concurrently, YAP nuclear localization also decreased, with the most rapid decline occurring within the range of 243-313 Oe. Importantly, cells were able to completely F-actin self-repair within 24 h, allowing YAP to re-enter the nucleus. This ability facilitates the quantitative and reversible control over YAP nuclear translocation. Further in vivo studies using MCF-7 tumor-bearing mouse models demonstrated the efficacy of this method in inhibiting glycolysis, reducing the 'Warburg effect', and reprogramming the tumor metabolic microenvironment. These results not only provide a promising strategy for precise manipulation of YAP nuclear localization but also establish a therapeutic framework for treating intractable diseases driven by YAP dysregulation.

AB  - This research examines whether the groundwater in the Sivakasi Region of South India is suitable for consumption, and assesses the possible health hazards for various age demographics including infants, children, teenagers, and adults. A total of 77 groundwater samples were gathered, covering a total area of 580 km(2) and analyzed for major and minor ions. The hydrogen ion concentration (pH) of the samples indicates neutral to marginally alkaline. The total dissolved solids (TDS) fluctuate from 255 to 2701 mg/l and electrical conductivity varies from 364 to 3540 mu S/cm. A wide range of fluoride concentration was detected (0.1 to 3.2 mg/l) with nearly 38% groundwater samples surpassing the proposed limit (1.5 mg/l) suggested by the World Health Organization in 2017. Gibbs plot analysis suggested that most of the samples were influenced by geogenic factors, primarily rock weathering in this region. Correlation analysis showed that most of the samples were impacted by both natural and human sources. The pollution index of groundwater (PIG) fluctuated from 0.67 to 2.60 with approximately 30% and 53% of samples falling into insignificant and low pollution categories, respectively. Furthermore, 10% and 5% of total samples were characterized as moderate and high pollution levels, and 2% as very high pollution category. Spatial analysis using GIS revealed that 440.63 km(2) were within safe fluoride levels according to the WHO standards, while 139.32 km(2) were identified as risk zone. The principal component analysis (PCA1) showed strong positive loadings on EC (0.994), TDS (0.905), Mg2+ (0.910), Cl- (0.903) and HCO3- (0.923) indicating rock water interaction. PCA2 accounts the high positive factor loading on HCO3- (0.864) indicating ion exchange and mineral leaching. The PCA1 and PCA2 indicated that variables such as mineral leaching and rock water interaction are the major mechanisms contributing to the chemical signatures in groundwater, which may support for the elevated fluoride levels in certain areas. Risk assessments, including Hazard Quotient results showed that 71%, 61% 38%, and 34% of groundwater samples exceeded the permissible THI limit (THI > 1) for infants, children, teenagers, and adults, respectively. The study recommends implementing measures such as denitrification, defluorination, rainwater harvesting, and improved sanitation infrastructure to enhance the health conditions in the study region. Additionally, it suggests introducing educational programs in rural areas to create awareness about the health dangers due to consumption of water with high fluoride levels.

AB  - Beyond a few obvious examples (e.g., gut length, amylase activity), digestive and metabolic specializations towards diet remain elusive in fishes. Thus, we compared gut length, delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of the liver, and expressed genes in the intestine and liver of wild-caught individuals of four closely-related, sympatric prickleback species (family Stichaeidae) with different diets: Xiphister mucosus (herbivore), its sister taxon X. atropurpureus (omnivore), Phytichthys chirus (omnivore) and the carnivorous Anoplarchus purpurescens. We also measured the same parameters after feeding them carnivore or omnivore diets in the laboratory for 4 weeks. Growth and isotopic signatures showed assimilation of the laboratory diets, and gut length was significantly longer in X. mucosus in comparison to the other fishes, whether in the wild, or in the lab consuming the different diets. Dozens of genes relating to digestion and metabolism were observed to be under selection in the various species, but P. chirus stood out with some genes in the liver showing strong positive selection, and these genes correlating with differing isotopic incorporation of the laboratory carnivore diet in this species. Although the intestine showed variation in the expression of hundreds of genes in response to the laboratory diets, the liver exhibited species-specific gene expression patterns that changed very little (generally <40 genes changing expression, with P. chirus providing an exception). Overall, our results suggest that the intestine is plastic in function, but the liver may be where specialization manifests since this tissue shows species-specific gene expression patterns that match with natural diet.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to validate a method for characterizing and quantifying the multi-elemental profiles of different insect flours to enable their distinction, identification, and quality assessment. The focus was on three insect species: cricket (Acheta domesticus), buffalo worm (Alphitobius diaperinus), and mealworm (Tenebrio molitor). Methods: Mealworms were powdered in the laboratory through mechanical processing. Sample analysis involved acid digestion using a microwave digester, followed by profiling with Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). This technique enabled rapid, multi-elemental analysis at trace levels. Chemometric methods, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for exploratory analysis, Covariance Selection-Linear Discriminant Analysis (CovSel-LDA), alongside forward stepwise LDA classification methods, were applied and compared. Results: ICP-MS accurately detected elements at micro trace levels. Both classification models, based on different variable selection methods and externally validated on a test set comprising 45% of the available samples, proved effective in classifying samples based on slightly different pools of trace elements. CovSel-LDA selected Mg and Se, whereas the stepwise-LDA focused on Mg, K, and Mn. Conclusions: the validated methods demonstrated high accuracy and generalizability, supporting their potential use in food industry applications. This model could assist in quality control, facilitating the introduction of insect-based flour into European and international markets as novel foods.

AB  - Background: Brown algae from the order Dictyotales are known to produce specialized metabolites with a wide array of biological activities. Studying these compounds is important for understanding their ecological roles, exploring biomedical potential and developing biotechnological applications. Methods: To evaluate the metabolic diversity of brown algae from the shallow habitats of the northern region of San Andr & eacute;s Island (Colombia, SW Caribbean), a metabolic profiling approach was employed, based on 1H-NMR spectra taken from organic extracts. Four sampling expeditions were conducted to collect the most abundant species, taking into account the taxonomic identity, growth substrate and collection date. Results: Five species were found and identified as Canistrocarpus crispatus, Stypopodium zonale, Dictyopteris delicatula, Padina gymnospora and Dictyota spp. Multivariate analyses applied to these spectra revealed that S. zonale and C. crispatus differentiated from the other samples mainly due to the signals for meroditerpenes and diterpenes, respectively. S. zonale had differential metabolic production observed when comparing algae collected in rocky bottoms with thalli growing on dead coral. This difference was attributed to changes in concentrations of the meroditerpene atomaric acid (1). Meanwhile, the major metabolite found in C. crispatus samples was dictyol B acetate (2). Conclusions: NMR metabolomics of San Andr & eacute;s brown algae differentiated species based on lipid content and metabolic complexity. Notably, prenylated-guaiane diterpenes characterized C. crispatus, and meroditerpenoid concentrations varied in S. zonale. Temporal lipid variations were observed in P. gymnospora, while juvenile Dictyota spp. presented a less complex metabolic signature.

AB  - A huge number of wild animals - mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds, including rare ones, are annually killed on roads of the Russian Federation. Approximate estimates of loss of fauna for areas with a developed network of roads are hundreds (for large predators and ungulates), thousands (for medium-sized animals) and tens and hundreds of thousands (for small mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians). It is revealed that the death rates of animals depend not only on the status of the highway, but also on its connection to natural, agricultural and urbanized lands in different natural zones. On this basis the table reflecting specific indicators of death On n)ads of different groups of animals is constructed. Based on the analysis of foreign sources and data on different regions Russia there are presented materials on different ways to reduce the risk of animal death on the roads the use of protective fences of different heights and lengths, above-ground and underground access systems through highways, etc. The article also discusses the risk of collision of cars with animals, ecological and geographical approaches to the assessment of their death and to the planning of animal protection and constructions for the passage of animals on the roads of European Russia. There are shown modern practical solutions, taking into account international experience, as reflected in the environmental strategy of the "Avtodor" and in the standard developed on the basis of the paper authors' recommendations "Requirement to wildlife crossings on the roads of the state company "Avtodor".

AB  - Dietary selection and preference are poorly understood for the mountain bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus isaaci Thomas, 1902). Focal animal sampling was used to determine seasonal food choice and preference for captive-bred individuals at the Mount Kenya Wildlife Conservancy, in preparation for reintroduction into the wild at a proposed sanctuary within the surrounding forest reserve. Food availability was assessed using nested plot sampling. Plant life forms contributed differently to the diet (H[4] = 28.93, p < 0.01), with shrubs accounting for 55%. Relative abundance of the principal food plant species influenced their contribution to the diet in both wet and dry seasons (chi(2) = 7.33, df = 1, p = 0.07; chi(2) = 2.47, df = 1, p = 0.116 respectively). Despite having a high relative abundance (1.88%), Trichocladus ellipticus Eckl. & Zeyh. was less preferred during the wet season (E* = 0.20). It was however most preferred during the dry season (E* = 0.78), possibly reflecting relative nutritive value. The bongos included a large proportion of grass (27%) in their diet like other browsing herbivores that inhabit forest glades. Compared to the conservancy, plant foods were well represented at the proposed sanctuary with 72% and 80% similarity in both wet and dry seasons. This potentially enhances the likelihood of bongos adapting and establishing once reintroduced.

AB  - ContextSwine production plays a vital role in economic development; however, balancing productivity with environmental and financial sustainability remains a challenge.ObjectiveThis study introduces an integrated approach combining Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Economic Value Added (EVA) to assess eco-efficiency in Brazilian piglet production, a stage often underrepresented in sustainability research.MethodsA Life Cycle Assessment was conducted to quantify environmental impacts, and EVA was used to evaluate financial performance. The analysis relied on data from 2016 to 2021, including greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and economic returns.Results and conclusionsResults indicate that improvements in sow productivity led to lower GHG emissions per kilogram of piglet and that eco-efficiency varied with market conditions. In 2021, increased productivity and favorable prices resulted in positive EVA and a 7.8% land use reduction.SignificanceThis study underscores the value of integrating environmental and economic assessments to support decision-making in swine systems. By applying the LCA-EVA framework to piglet production, this research provides insights to enhance the sustainability of pork value chains.

AB  - This field study presents an elimination strategy for African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV), particularly low-virulence genotype II strains, in a large-scale breeding herd in China. Since its introduction to China in 2018, ASFV has spread rapidly, causing significant economic losses. The emergence of low-virulence strains in 2020 further complicated the efforts against this virus. We describe a case study on a farm with 6000 sows in eastern China. Upon ASFV detection, pig movements were ceased immediately, strict biosecurity protocols were implemented, and an epidemiological investigation was conducted to identify high-risk zones. Pigs that tested positive or within high-risk zones were culled, followed by extensive disinfection of exposed areas and whole-herd PCR screening. Injection of a foot and mouth disease vaccine was utilized to stimulate virus excretion of latent infections for better detection. Four rounds of whole-herd tests were conducted to confirm the elimination of ASFV. This case study highlights the importance of timely monitoring, rapid culling, thorough disinfection, and enhanced biosecurity as an effort to control ASF outbreaks in a low-impact and more cost-efficient manner, so called "tooth extraction."

AB  - Under large-scale farming conditions, automated sow estrus detection is crucial for improving reproductive efficiency, optimizing breeding management, and reducing labor costs. Conventional estrus detection relies heavily on human expertise, a practice that introduces subjective variability and consequently diminishes both accuracy and efficiency. Failure to identify estrus promptly and pair animals effectively lowers breeding success rates and drives up overall husbandry costs. In response to the need for the automated detection of sows' estrus states in large-scale pig farms, this study proposes a method for detecting sows' vulvar status and estrus based on multi-dimensional feature crossing. The method adopts a dual optimization strategy: First, the Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network-Selective Decoding Integration (BiFPN-SDI) module performs the bidirectional, weighted fusion of the backbone's low-level texture and high-level semantic, retaining the multi-dimensional cues most relevant to vulvar morphology and producing a scale-aligned, minimally redundant feature map. Second, by embedding a Spatially Enhanced Attention Module head (SEAM-Head) channel attention mechanism into the detection head, the model further amplifies key hyperemia-related signals, while suppressing background noise, thereby enabling cooperative and more precise bounding box localization. To adapt the model for edge computing environments, Masked Generative Distillation (MGD) knowledge distillation is introduced to compress the model while maintaining the detection speed and accuracy. Based on the bounding box of the vulvar region, the aspect ratio of the target area and the red saturation features derived from a dual-threshold method in the HSV color space are used to construct a lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classification model for estrus state determination. The network was trained on 1400 annotated samples, which were divided into training, testing, and validation sets in an 8:1:1 ratio. On-farm evaluations in commercial pig facilities show that the proposed system attains an 85% estrus detection success rate. Following lightweight optimization, inference latency fell from 24.29 ms to 18.87 ms, and the model footprint was compressed from 32.38 MB to 3.96 MB in the same machine, while maintaining a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.941; the accuracy penalty from model compression was kept below 1%. Moreover, the model demonstrates robust performance under complex lighting and occlusion conditions, enabling real-time processing from vulvar localization to estrus detection, and providing an efficient and reliable technical solution for automated estrus monitoring in large-scale pig farms.

AB  - Introduction Membrane proteins play an important role in living organisms as one of the main components of biological membranes. The problem in membrane protein classification and prediction is an important topic of membrane proteomics research because the function of proteins can be quickly determined if membrane protein types can be discriminated. Methods Most current methods to classify membrane proteins are labor-intensive and require a lot of resources. In this study, five methods, Average Block (AvBlock), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Histogram of Orientation Gradient (HOG), and Pseudo-PSSM (PsePSSM), were used to extract features in order to predict membrane proteins on a large scale. Then, we combined the five obtained feature matrices and constructed the corresponding hypergraph association matrix. Finally, the feature matrices and hypergraph association matrices were integrated to identify the types of membrane proteins using a hypergraph neural network model (HGNN). Results The proposed method was tested on four membrane protein benchmark datasets to evaluate its performance. The results showed 92.8%, 88.6%, 88.2%, and 99.0% accuracy on each of the four datasets. Conclusion Compared to traditional machine learning classifier methods, such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), etc. HGNN prediction performance was found to be better.

AB  - The global significance of fluoride and nitrate contamination in coastal areas cannot be overstated, as these contaminants pose critical environmental and public health challenges across the world. Water quality is an essential component in sustaining environmental health. This integrated study aimed to assess indexical and spatial water quality, potential contamination sources, and health risks associated with groundwater resources in Al-Hassa, Saudi Arabia. Groundwater samples were tested using standard methods. The physiochemical results indicated overall groundwater pollution. This study addresses the critical issue of drinking water resource suitability assessment by introducing an innovative approach based on the pollution index of groundwater (PIG). Focusing on the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, where water resource management is of paramount importance, we employed advanced machine learning (ML) models to forecast groundwater suitability using several combinations (C1 = EC + Na + Mg + Cl, C2 = TDS + TA + HCO3 + K + Ca, and C3 = SO4 + pH + NO3 + F + Turb). Six ML models, including random forest (RF), decision trees (DT), XgBoost, CatBoost, linear regression, and support vector machines (SVM), were utilized to predict groundwater quality. These models, based on several performance criteria (MAPE, MAE, MSE, and DC), offer valuable insights into the complex relationships governing groundwater pollution with an accuracy of more than 90%. To enhance the transparency and interpretability of the ML models, we incorporated the local interpretable model-agnostic explanation method, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). SHAP allows us to interpret the prediction-making process of otherwise opaque black-box models. We believe that the integration of ML models and SHAP-based explainability offers a promising avenue for sustainable water resource management in Saudi Arabia and can serve as a model for addressing similar challenges worldwide. By bridging the gap between complex data-driven predictions and actionable insights, this study contributes to the advancement of environmental stewardship and water security in the region.

AB  - Alpacas represent an exotic species for Italy, introduced no more than 20-30 years ago. Nevertheless, they are currently the most widespread camelid species reared in this country, highlighting the growing interest in breeding this species. So, it is useful to assess parameters on their growth in relation to the new environment. Thus, body weight and body measures were recorded on 49 healthy alpacas of Huacaya type (27 females, 22 males), along a period of 27 months. Overall, 111 individual observations were made. Data were analysed by ANOVA, as growth curves were estimated by applying the Gompertz's model. Multiple regression was finally used to estimate body weight from body measures. Body weight and linear measures, except for the distance between iliac crest and the length of the rump, were influenced by the category (calves, yearlings, adults) and by the age class within category (p < 0.05), while gender and interaction between gender and category were never significant (p > 0.05). Asymptotic weigh of males was 8.25% higher than females (p < 0.05). Moreover, males at maturity had higher withers (+0.96%), longer body (+2.70%) and chest measurements (+3.18%) than females. Asymptotic rump width (both at the ilium and at the ischium) was higher in females (respectively + 6.19%; +12.90%). According to our work, the best equation for the estimate of body weight from body measures was the following: 5.691 + 0.00005624 * chest circumference(3) + 0.00002298 * trunk length(3) - 1.155 * rump width between ischial tuberosities + 0.00001545 * height at rump(3) (R-2=0.957; SE of estimate = 4.36 kg), that is important for a better management of the species.

AB  - Global environmental change impacts human security in both Vanuatu and Guam - but in very different ways. This paper studies both regions through a thematic analysis of problem-centered expert interviews with local stakeholders. It provides a comprehensive assessment of pathways from environmental change to human insecurity in both regions. Climate change impacts are omnipresent in Vanuatu and coproduced by fast lifestyle change and developmental challenges. In contrast, Guam is a highly developed US territory. This reduces climate vulnerability but generates other forms of environmental change from heavy military and touristic use. The article argues that human insecurity on Vanuatu and Guam is coproduced by the interplay between economic and (post-)colonial factors and environmental change. This demonstrates that vulnerability and environmental degradation are by no means natural or inevitable, but strongly shaped by socio-economic contexts and histories. This builds an important bridge between human security, political economy, and postcolonial perspectives on environmental security.

AB  - Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The F508del and G542X are the most common mutations found in US patients, accounting for 86.4% and 4.6% of all mutations, respectively. The F508del causes deletion of the phenylalanine residue at position 508 and is associated with impaired CFTR protein folding. The G542X is a nonsense mutation that introduces a stop codon into the mRNA, thus preventing normal CFTR protein synthesis. Here, we describe the generation of CFTRF508del/F508del and CFTRG542X/G542X lambs using CRISPR/Cas9 and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). First, we introduced either F508del or G542X mutations into sheep fetal fibroblasts that were subsequently used as nuclear donors for SCNT. The newborn CF lambs develop pathology similar to CFTR-/- sheep and CF patients. Moreover, tracheal epithelial cells from the CFTRF508del/F508del lambs responded to a human CFTR (hCFTR) potentiator and correctors, and those from CFTRG542X/G542X lambs showed modest restoration of CFTR function following inhibition of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) and aminoglycoside antibiotic treatments. Thus, the phenotype and electrophysiology of these novel models represent an important advance for testing new CF therapeutics and gene therapy to improve the health of patients with this life-limiting disorder.

AB  - In the context of the Persian leopard restoration program in the Russian Caucasus, an in-depth analysis was conducted to understand the hunting behaviors of rewilded Persian leopards and evaluate the program's effectiveness. From 2016 to 2023, GPS telemetry data from 14 leopards (8 males and 6 females) aged 20 months and older, released in the Western (WeC) and Central (CeC) Caucasus, were analyzed. Using cluster location analysis, we determined 243 kill sites categorized by prey-size into large, medium, and small classes. In the WeC, leopards exhibit a significantly higher proportion of large prey compared to the CeC (43%, N = 49 vs. 5.4%, N = 148, p < 0.01). There is no significant difference in the proportion of medium-sized prey, but there is a striking contrast in the proportion of small prey (WeC 16.2%, CeC 57.4% (p < 0.01)). No significant differences were found in the time spent on prey between male and female leopards, regardless of the region. Female leopards capture their next prey 215 +/- 184 hours (Mean +/- SD; N = 131) after leaving the previous one, covering a distance of 46 +/- 40 km (Mean +/- SD, max 191 km). Male leopards, in contrast, take 265 +/- 246 hours (Mean +/- SD, N = 110) between kills, with a distance of 59 +/- 60 km (Mean +/- SD, max 366 km) between them. In the WeC, the kill rate for leopards are lower than in the CeC, with averages of a prey every 264 +/- 273 hours and 62 +/- 64 km (N = 77) compared to 152 +/- 172 hours and 47 +/- 41 km (N = 165), respectively. Leopards in the CeC spend significantly more time on kill sites with large and medium-sized prey compared to small prey. In contrast, leopards in the WeC show no significant difference in the time spent on prey of different size classes. This disparity is explained by the fact that large and medium-sized prey are more challenging to conceal and defend from competitors whose populations densities are higher in the WeC than the CeC. 20% of large and medium-size prey kill sites of leopard in the Western Caucasus have been visited by bears or wolves. This suggests that environmental factors and attractive high ungulate population densities may also play a critical role in shaping predator-prey dynamics and interspecific competition in the region. It is imperative to evaluate the availability of potential prey across different size classes, alongside with moderate levels of competitor populations. These factors can play a decisive role during the crucial first year of the leopard's adaptation to life in the wild, ultimately determining the success of species restoration initiatives.

AB  - This paper presents mathematical models that can simulate the cardiovascular system of a healthy sheep under normal resting conditions in which the heart rate changes significantly. The models include several new modelling features that are introduced progressively. The contraction of the cardiac chambers is modelled using a time-dependent muscle force with constant elasticity instead of time dependent elasticity. A new hypothesis about the mechanical contraction of the atria generates realistic pressure volume (PV) loops. The inter-ventricular interaction is modelled as well. Additionally, hysteresis is incorporated in the aortic valve to produce an end-systolic reverse (negative) flow. Most of the model parameter values are based on previous literature data while time periods of delay, atrial and ventricular contraction are derived using experimental data from 14 sheep. We provide new relationships between contraction time and delay as a function of heart period. The effects of different aspects of our modelling on the mean cardiac output, stroke volume, ejection time, ejection fraction and PV loops are studied. Model outputs are compared with published experimental results where possible, and are within a wide range of physiological observations.

AB  - Redox homeostasis plays a pivotal role in maintaining the oocyte's developmental capacity. However, accumulating evidence indicated that an excessive amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was produced during oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM). Therefore, it is necessary to develop strategies for further improving the anti-oxidative potential of IVM oocytes. This study aims to investigate the effects of hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles on redox homeostasis maintenance during ovine oocyte IVM. Additionally, the mechanism underlying the protective role of HA against oxidative stress was systematically analyzed. In this study, HA nanoparticles were introduced at concentrations of 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.5% during the IVM process. The survival rate of oocytes was assessed to identify the maximum concentration of HA nanoparticles without cytotoxicity after a 24 h culture period. The levels of ROS, glutathione (GSH), mitochondrial membrane potential, and early apoptosis were evaluated to determine the impact of HA nanoparticles on the antioxidant capacity of the oocytes. Furthermore, Smart-RNA sequencing technology was utilized to identify differentially expressed mRNAs (DEMs) induced by nanoparticles during the maturation process. The results indicated that 0.3% HA had no adverse effect on the oocyte survival rate, suggesting its potential applicability in IVM. What's more, antioxidant capacity assessments revealed that 0.3% HA nanoparticles significantly reduced ROS levels, increased GSH levels, and enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential; however, there was no difference in early apoptosis. Furthermore, a total of 928 DEMs were identified, including 377 upregulated and 551 downregulated mRNAs in oocytes treated with HA. Functional enrichment analysis of the DEMs using GO, KEGG, GSEA, and STEM revealed that HA nanoparticles enhanced oocyte maturation by modulating ROS through thermogenesis signaling pathway. Additionally, core genes such as ATP8, NDUFB10, PPARG, and COX5B were predominantly enriched in the thermogenic pathway.

AB  - Introduction: Cryptorchidism is a hereditary anomaly characterized by the incomplete descent of one or both testicles to the scrotum. One of the challenges of this anomaly is that the retained testicle maintains its endocrine function. As a consequence, cryptorchid animals produce hormone-tainted meat in comparison to castrated animals and are likely to be more aggressive. Cryptorchidism can lead to reduced animal welfare outcomes and cause economic losses. Identifying genetic markers for cryptorchidism is an essential step toward mitigating these negative outcomes and may facilitate genome manipulation to reduce the occurrence of cryptorchidism. Attempts to identify such markers have used genome-wide association studies. Using whole-exome sequencing, we aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding regions of cryptorchid pigs and to characterize functional pathways concerning these SNPs. Methods: DNA was extracted and sequenced from 5 healthy and 5 cryptorchid animals from the Landrace breed, using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Data were pre-processed using the SeqyClean tool and further mapped against the swine reference genome (Sus scrofa 11.1) using BWA software. GATK was used to identify polymorphisms (SNPs and InDels), which were annotated using the VEP tool. Network prediction and gene ontology enrichment analysis were conducted using the Cytoscape platform, and STRING software was used for visualization. Results: A total of 63 SNPs were identified across the genes PIGB, CCPG1, COMMD9, LDLRAD3, TRIM44, MYLPF, SEPTIN, ZNF48, TIA1, FAIM2, KRT18, FBP1, FBP2, CTSL, DAPK1, DHX8, GPR179, DEPDC1B, ENSSSCG00000049573, ENSSSCG00000016384, ENSSSCG00000022657, ENSSSCG00000038825, and ENSSSCG00000001229. Using pathway enrichment analyses and network prospection, we have identified the following significant adjusted p value threshold of 0.001 involved with the biological function pathways of estrogen signaling, cytoskeleton organization, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Conclusion: Our data suggest the involvement of new SNPs and genes in developing cryptorchidism in pigs. However, further studies are needed to validate our results in a larger cohort population. Variations in the GPR179 gene, with implications at the protein level, may be associated with the appearance of this anomaly in the swine. Finally, we are showing that the estrogen signaling pathway may be involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of this congenital anomaly as previously reported in GWAS.

AB  - The apple snail Pomacea canaliculata is native to South America and has been introduced into many regions outside its natural range. Despite being one of the world's 100 worst invasive species, little is known about the pathologies caused by parasites other than digeneans. Here, we identify and characterize a xenoma-forming ciliate in P. canaliculata from three waterbodies in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, using histology, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and molecular analyses. Under a stereomicroscope, the xenomas appeared individually as white nodules measuring up to 2 mm in diameter. Of the 133 snails examined by histology, 23 were infected with xenomas (17 %) that occupied the connective tissue of most organs, with 74 % of these were located in the kidney. Snails from the three water bodies were infected. The highest prevalence was observed in the Mar del Plata Port Reserve Pond (25 %), followed by Los Padres Lake (16.4 %) and Pig & uuml;e<acute accent>-Venado Channel (14.4 %). Of the infected snails, 70 % had a low infection intensity (fewer than 10 xenomas per slide). No significant inflammatory response was observed in host tissues. However, in specimens with xenoma accumulations, significant tissue changes were observed, including organ enlargement in the gill lamellae, mantle border, and lung, as well as tubule compression and connective tissue replacement in the digestive gland. The host cell becomes hypertrophied, and its nucleus disintegrates. Although no cilia were observed in histological sections, TEM analysis revealed that the organisms had cilia near the cytostome and around the body, a large food vacuole, a macronucleus, and a micronucleus. Phylogenetic analysis of the SSU rDNA sequence placed the ciliate in the class Phyllopharyngea, showing the closest relationship to an uncultured eukaryote identified by BLAST. This is the fifth record of xenoma-inducing ciliates in mollusks and the first report in a gastropod.

AB  - Cellulose is essential in the growth and development of herbivores. However, its limited utilization by herbivores is a key factor restricting their feed conversion rates. Cellulase can hydrolyze cellulose into glucose, and the addition of exogenous cellulase preparations to feed is an effective method for improving the cellulose utilization rate of ruminants. Nevertheless, the decomposition efficiency of exogenous cellulase is unstable and susceptible to various external factors. In this study, the endoglucanase III gene from Apriona germari (AgEGase III) was introduced into silkworms to investigate whether transgenic silkworms with cellulose-digesting capabilities outperformed normal silkworms in terms of growth, reproduction, and economic traits. The results show that the transgenic silkworms exhibited increased body size, weight, feeding efficiency, and digestibility compared to the wild-type silkworms. The cocoon weight, shell weight, cocoon-shell ratio, and pupa weight were notably elevated by 11%, 37%, 23%, and 9%, respectively. Additionally, the egg weight and egg-laying quantity of the female moth were also significantly increased compared to those of the wild type. Furthermore, feeding transgenic silkworms with an artificial feed containing additional cellulose demonstrated their ability to digest and utilize cellulose, leading to improved growth and development. This study offers theoretical support for the development of transgenic ruminant species that express cellulolytic enzymes.

AB  - Emotional contagion refers to the sharing of emotional states between individuals and can cause depressive behaviors in healthy persons who live with depressed individuals. Negative emotional contagion has been observed in animal models, but the vast majority of studies are short-term and bear little resemblance to long-term human relationships. Thus, the first aim of this study was to establish an animal model of stress-induced negative emotional contagion that develops across time and between pairs. To accomplish this, we tested the hypothesis that sedentary male rats that cohabitate for five weeks with a stress-exposed female will exhibit a depression-like phenotype that is observable on behavioral and physiological measures. In addition, drawing from a comprehensive literature that describes the beneficial effects of prior exercise on stress-related behavior, we tested our second hypothesis that in males that were paired with a stressed female, prior voluntary exercise will diminish the impact of negative emotional contagion. We found that pair housing a healthy male with a stressed female led to emotional contagion; males gained less body weight, were anhedonic, demonstrated heightened anxiety-like behavior, had lower serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, had decreased hippocampal BDNF-stimulated tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling and had increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the hippocampus. For the most part, the five-week exercise window that occurred prior to pair housing had few effects in non-stress paired rats, but had partial, yet substantial protective effects in rats that were pair-housed with a stressed female. Specifically, stress-paired, exercised rats showed less depressive-like behavior, had partially preserved hippocampal BDNF-stimulated TrkB signaling, had normalized serum BDNF concentration, and had hippocampal cytokine and immediate early gene levels that were equivalent to controls. These preclinical findings introduce a new model of negative emotional contagion between dyads of male-female rats and support the view that inclusion of exercise programs would be beneficial for persons that may, in the future, be susceptible to negative emotional contagion.

AB  - Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being adopted at an unprecedented rate, yet still face challenges in knowledge-intensive domains like biomedicine. Solutions such as pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning add substantial computational overhead, requiring further domain-expertise. Here, we introduce a token-optimized and robust Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) framework by leveraging a massive biomedical KG (SPOKE) with LLMs such as Llama-2-13b, GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, to generate meaningful biomedical text rooted in established knowledge. Results: Compared to the existing RAG technique for Knowledge Graphs, the proposed method utilizes minimal graph schema for context extraction and uses embedding methods for context pruning. This optimization in context extraction results in more than 50% reduction in token consumption without compromising the accuracy, making a cost-effective and robust RAG implementation on proprietary LLMs. KG-RAG consistently enhanced the performance of LLMs across diverse biomedical prompts by generating responses rooted in established knowledge, accompanied by accurate provenance and statistical evidence (if available) to substantiate the claims. Further benchmarking on human curated datasets, such as biomedical true/false and multiple-choice questions (MCQ), showed a remarkable 71% boost in the performance of the Llama-2 model on the challenging MCQ dataset, demonstrating the framework's capacity to empower open-source models with fewer parameters for domain-specific questions. Furthermore, KG-RAG enhanced the performance of proprietary GPT models, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. In summary, the proposed framework combines explicit and implicit knowledge of KG and LLM in a token optimized fashion, thus enhancing the adaptability of general-purpose LLMs to tackle domain-specific questions in a cost-effective fashion.

AB  - Introduction: In this study estimated genetic and phenotypic correlations between fifteen complete blood count (CBC) traits and thirty-three heritable plasma metabolites in young healthy nursery pigs. In addition, it provided an opportunity to identify candidate genes associated with variation in metabolite concentration and their potential association with immune response, disease resilience, and production traits.
   Methods: The blood samples were collected from healthy young pigs and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) was used to quantify plasma metabolites. CBC was determined using the ADVIA (R) 2120i Hematology System. Genetic correlations of metabolite with CBC traits and single step genome-wide association study (ssGWAS) were estimated using the BLUPF90 programs.
   Results: Results showed low phenotypic correlation estimates between plasma metabolites and CBC traits. The highest phenotypic correlation was observed between lactic acid and plasma basophil concentration (0.36 +/- 0.04; p < 0.05). Several significant genetic correlations were found between metabolites and CBC traits. The plasma concentration of proline was genetically positively correlated with hemoglobin concentration (0.94 +/- 0.03; p < 0.05) and L-tyrosine was negatively correlated with mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH; -0.92 +/- 0.74; p < 0.05). The genomic regions identified in this study only explained a small percentage of the genetic variance of metabolites levels that were genetically correlated with CBC, resilience, and production traits.
   Discussion: The results of this systems approach suggest that several plasma metabolite phenotypes are phenotypically and genetically correlated with CBC traits, suggesting that they may be potential genetic indicators of immune response following disease challenge. Genomic analysis revealed genes and pathways that might interact to modulate CBC, resilience, and production traits.

AB  - IntroductionElectroacupuncture (EA) is a beneficial physiotherapy approach for addressing neuropsychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, the impact of EA on the gut microbiome in relation to anxiety disorders remains poorly understood.MethodsTo address this gap, we conducted a study using a chronic restraint stress (CRS) mouse model to investigate the anti-anxiety outcome of EA and its influence on gut microbiota. Our research involved behavioral tests and comprehensive sequencing of full-length 16S rRNA microbiomes.ResultsOur findings revealed that CRS led to significant anxiety-like behaviors and an imbalance in the gut microbiota. Specifically, we identified 13 species that exhibited changes associated with anxiety-like behaviors. Furthermore, EA partially alleviated both behaviors related to anxiety and the dysbiosis induced by CRS.DiscussionIn summary, this study sheds light on the alterations in gut microbiota species resulting from CRS treatment and brings new light into the connection between EA's anti-anxiety effects and the gut microbiota.

AB  - Current management models for many endangered species focus primarily on demographic recovery, often ignoring their intrinsic ecological requirements. Across the protected area network of southern Africa, most southern white rhinoceros are managed in populations of less than 50 individuals, experiencing restricted dispersal opportunities, and limited breeding male numbers due to their exclusive home range requirements. In the absence of information on the breeding structure of these populations, poor management decisions may require females to either forego a breeding opportunity or select to inbreed with close relatives. Here, we use a combination of social pedigree data together with genetic analyses to reconstruct the parentage of all 28 offspring produced in a 5-year period in a managed free-ranging southern white rhinoceros population. During this period, all breeding females (founders and first-generation daughters) had access to both a founder male (father to most of the daughters) and two recently introduced inexperienced males. We report that while founder females were more likely to breed with the founder male, their daughters, in contrast, were more likely to breed with the introduced males, thus avoiding inbreeding. However, we also found evidence of father-daughter inbreeding in this population, and contend that in the absence of choice, rather than forego a breeding opportunity, female white rhinoceros will inbreed with their fathers. We argue that to effectively conserve the southern white rhinoceros, managers need to understand the breeding structure of these small populations, particularly in terms of parentage and kinship.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in alpacas on selected farms in Poland. In July and August 2019 and August 2021, 223 samples from six commercial farms were examined using coproscopic techniques. The total percentage of alpacas infected with intestinal parasites was 57.7%. Eggs of Nematodirus sp. were found in 28.9%, Trichostrongylus sp. in 15.5%, Strongyloides sp. in 13.4%, Camelostrongylus sp. in 11.3%, other strongyle-type in 12.4%, Trichuris sp. in 3.1%, Capillaria spp. in 2.1%, Oesophagostomum sp. in 1.0% and eggs of Moniezia sp. in 1.0% of individuals. Oocysts of Eimeria macusaniensis were found in 8.2%, Eimeria sp. in 4.1%, and Cryptosporidium sp. in 3.1% of animals. Redundancy analysis showed that parasites and their number in faeces were related to the individual's country of origin, sex and age. Females had significantly more eggs of parasites than males. More significant parasite infection was recorded in younger individuals. Moreover, the most infected were individuals from Germany. Some of the described parasites in tested alpacas have zoonotic potential. Due to the possibility of introducing parasites native to alpacas and acquiring species parasitising wild and farmed animals in Europe, permanent veterinary monitoring of animals imported from other regions is necessary.

AB  - Accurate estimates of demographic parameters are instrumental in effective management of animal populations. For species with individually distinctive features, photo-identification (photo-ID) provides a reliable means to gather capture-recapture data for population parameter estimation with considerable precision and accuracy. We use a 3-year photo-ID mark-recapture dataset of African savannah elephants (Loxodontaafricana) in Pilanesberg National Park (PNP), South Africa, to model their population size and estimate survival rates. All photographed elephants, irrespective of age, were individually identified based on their unique pattern of facial wrinkles. The population currently numbers 385 elephants (95% CI = 380-401), of which nearly half are grown individuals in a sex ratio of 1 male: 1.23 female. Considerable heterogeneity in capture and recapture probabilities, both within and between sex-age classes suggests some form of individual-specific or herd-specific variability, perhaps behavioural or spatio-behavioural dissimilarity within the PNP population. Estimated annual survival rates are high (0.967-0.996) and do not differ between sex-age classes, a likely expression of an extended parental care, low predation pressure, access to rich food and water resources, and absence of targeted killing/poaching. The lack of detectable difference between sexes in adult survival/mortality sets PNP elephants apart from other known African elephant populations and warrants further research attention. Given previous estimates (aerial counts in the early 2000s), the PNP elephant population has grown similar to 5.7% per annum over a 16-year period. This is similar to what is reported in other conservation areas in South Africa, but considerably lower than previously projected. Natural mortality, even if low as 0.4-3.3%, is not negligible and plays a role in moderating population growth. This realisation must be recognised when considering population management measures. It is, therefore, important to obtain and apply the most up-to-date population-specific demographic parameters when making management decisions. Periodic photo-ID surveys with mark-recapture analyses can generate such demographic indicators with a considerable accuracy and should be adopted as a useful tool to inform management decisions, complimentary to direct aerial counts, especially in small-to-medium size fenced conservation areas.

AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of tannins on plant protein during sheep digestion using a digestomic approach combining in vivo (rumen) conditions and an in vitro digestive system (abomasum and small intestine). Ruminal fluid from wethers infused with a tannin solution or water (control) was introduced into the digester, and protein degradation was followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Tannin infusion in the rumen led to a clear decrease in protein degradation-related fermentation end-products, whereas ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCo) protein was more abundant than in control wethers. In the simulated abomasum, peptidomic analysis showed more degradation products of RuBisCo in the presence of tannins. The effect of RuBisCo protection by tannins continued to impact Rubisco digestion into early-stage intestinal digestion but was no longer detectable in late-stage intestinal digestion. The peptidomics approach proved a potent tool for identifying and quantifying the type of protein hydrolyzed throughout the gastrointestinal tract.

AB  - Conductive agro-industrial wastes as accelerants in the anaerobic digestion (AD) of organic waste is a good technique for developing a rural circular economy, such as producing bioenergy and biofertilizer. This study disclosed the a role of sugar cane bagasse ash (SCBA) in enhancing the bioenergy (biogas) yield and digestate fertility via anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) of buffalo dung (BD) and vegetable residue (VR) under mesophilic conditions (37 ᴼC). Firstly, an optimal BD/VR ratio (1:3) was determined based on biogas yield by introducing five different BD/VR ratios (1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, and 0:1) into AcoD systems. Secondly, the biogas yield was increased further by adding SCBA at five different concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 wt%). Experimental results disclosed that the 1.5 wt% of SCBA gave the highest cumulative biogas yield (153.67 mL/g VS), COD removal rate (31.18%), and fertility (5.08%). Moreover, a framework is suggested to understand the role of SCBA in the enhanced DIET mechanism. This work documents an environmentally friendly and economical technique for developing a rural circular bioeconomy via the AD of organic agro-waste.

AB  - Introduction: Non-motor symptoms (NMS) have high prevalence in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). These symptoms are mainly the result of increased oxidative stress and neuronal damage. In this study we investigated the possible neuroprotective effects of anethole as a potent antioxidant on rotenone-induced behavioral deficits, hippocampal neuronal death, and oxidative stress profile in rats.Methods: Male Wistar rats were administered with anethole (62.5, 125, and 250 mg/kg, i.g) concomitantly with rotenone (2 mg/kg, s.c) for 35 days. Shuttle box and novel object recognition tests were performed to determine cognitive functions, and tail flick test was used to measure pain sensitivity. The levels of BDNF, MDA, SOD, and GPx were assayed in the hippocampus. Hippocampal neuronal damage was evaluated using cresyl violet staining technique.Results: Chronic administration of rotenone induced cognitive deficit and reduced thermal pain threshold. Rotenone also decreased SOD and GPx activities, increased MDA level, and reduced the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus. In addition, hippocampal neuronal loss was increased in rotenone treated rats. Treatment with high dose of anethole (250 mg/kg) improved cognitive function and increased pain threshold in all three doses (62.5, 125, and 250 mg/kg). Despite the unchanged SOD and GPx activities, hippocampal levels of MDA was significantly decreased after high-dose anethole treatment. Moreover, High dose of anethole increased the number of surviving neurons in the hippocampus, but couldn't increase the BDNF expression. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that anethole has antioxidant and neuroprotective effects against non-motor disorders induced by rotenone toxicity.

AB  - IntroductionThe Taenia solium tapeworm is responsible for cysticercosis, a neglected tropical disease presenting as larvae in the body of a host following taenia egg ingestion. Neurocysticercosis (NCC), the name of the disease when it affects the human central nervous system, is a major cause of epilepsy in developing countries, and can also cause intracranial hypertension, hydrocephalus and death. Simulation models can help identify the most cost-effective interventions before their implementation. Modelling NCC should enable the comparison of a broad range of interventions, from treatment of human taeniasis (presence of an adult taenia worm in the human intestine) to NCC mitigation. It also allows a focus on the actual impact of the disease, rather than using proxies as is the case for other models. MethodsThis agent-based model is the first model that simulates human NCC and associated pathologies. It uses the output of another model, CystiAgent, which simulates the evolution of pig cysticercosis and human taeniasis, adding human and cyst agents, including a model of cyst location and stage, human symptoms, and treatment. CystiHuman also accounts for delays in the appearance of NCC-related symptoms. It comprises three modules detailing cyst development, seizure probability and timing, and intracranial hypertension/hydrocephalus, respectively. It has been implemented in Java MASON and calibrated in three endemic villages in Peru, then applied to another village (Rica Playa) to compare simulation results with field data in that village. Results and discussionDespite limitations in available field data, parameter values found through calibration are plausible and simulated outcomes in Rica Playa are close to actual values for NCC prevalence and the way it increases with age and cases with single lesions. Initial simulations further suggest that short-term interventions followed by a rapid increase in taeniasis prevalence back to original levels may have limited impacts on NCC prevalence.
   Author summaryThis paper presents CystiHuman, the first model of human neurocysticercosis, a parasitic disease that is responsible for a large proportion of epilepsy cases in developing countries and also contributes to intracranial hypertension, hydrocephalus and death. Existing modelling efforts have focused so far on parasite transmission i.e., how the parasite responsible for neurocysticercosis, Taenia solium, persists through interactions between humans and pigs. Such models, however, generally do not simulate neurocysticercosis itself or associated symptoms. CystiHuman complements these efforts by proposing a model of neurocysticercosis, associated symptoms, and likelihood of treatment. Overall, initial model outcomes are coherent with field data regarding neurocysticercosis prevalence and age patterns. The model suggests that short-term interventions that successfully reduce parasite transmission to a small fraction of its original level, but are followed (as has often been the case so far) by a rapid recuperation in transmission levels, will likely fail to produce a substantial reduction in neurocysticercosis prevalence. We view the present model as a first iteration of CystiHuman. Future iterations should use new field data to refine aspects of the model and ensure its full validation. They should also include cost information to inform cost-effectiveness analyses of interventions to address the disease.

AB  - IntroductionAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by amyloid plaque deposits, neuronal cell loss, and memory impairment. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a growth factor associated with AD improvement. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) mediates therapeutic effects of G-CSF. This study investigated the effect of combination treatment of G-CSF and SDF-1 on amyloid plaque deposits, apoptosis, and behavior of AD rats. MethodsIntracerebroventricular amyloid-beta [A beta(1-42)] peptide was used to induce AD in A beta rats. There were six groups including naive control, sham-operated, A beta, A beta + G-CSF, A beta + SDF-1, and A beta + G-CSF + SDF-1. SDF-1 intra-cerebroventricular (ICV), G-CSF Subcutaneous (SC), or a combination of them were administered to A beta rats weekly for 2 months. The cognition and memory were assessed using the novel object recognition, passive avoidance, and Morris water maze tests. Next, rat brains were removed and the amyloid plaque and apoptosis were detected in the brain and hippocampus using immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay, respectively. ResultsThe amyloid-beta and apoptotic cell levels dropped in groups receiving SDF-1 and G-CSF combination compared to the A beta group. Also, number of microglial cells increased significantly in the combination group compared to other treatment groups. Moreover, learning and memory were significantly improved in the combination group compared to the A beta groups (P < 0.05). ConclusionSDF-1 and G-CSF combination therapy can offer a promising strategy for AD.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the following effects: (1) the inclusion of olive in the animal's diet on the dry-cured shoulder; (2) the effect of curing on three different muscles (infraspinatus, supraspinatus, and subscapular); (3) the effect of different curing times (fresh shoulder, 6 months curing, and 12 months curing). For this purpose, forty shoulders were used, followed by a cold nitrite-free curing process with controlled humidity and temperature, according to the flowchart of a company that implements highly stringent standards in terms of food safety and quality. Samples were evaluated for their physicochemical composition and lipid profile. All the physicochemical composition parameters were significantly different (p < 0.001) in the three muscles studied. As might be expected, the curing times from the fresh product to the final product were also significantly different for all the parameters studied in this work. Regarding the inclusion of olive cake, it was found that treatment with a base diet + 10% exhausted olive cake (T4) showed higher levels for the parameters NaCl, collagen, and total fat. As for the fatty acid profile, in general, the olive did not influence the final product. On the other hand, we found that the type of muscle and the curing time of the cured shoulder had a significant influence on the fatty acid profile. We should also point out that there are significant differences in the interaction between curing time and muscle, particularly in saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), as well as the lipid quality indices. Canonical discriminant analysis is viable for evaluating the evolution of the curing process, discriminating and classifying curing times, and evaluating the muscles of the B & iacute;saro pork shoulder. Also, the introduction of olive cake into the animal diet does not affect the final product obtained.

AB  - Rapid and accurate measurements of eye muscle area and backfat thickness in breeding pigs is crucial for improving breeding traits. Within reasonable ranges, these traits significantly influence the number of piglets born, their birth weights, and survival rates. Traditional detection methods are time-consuming and heavily reliant on operational expertise. While B-mode ultrasound is widely used as a non-invasive tool for measuring backfat thickness and eye muscle area, its efficiency and precision are limited by dependence on the operator. To address these issues, this study introduces the BEGV2-UNet model, an innovative UNet network based on reconstructing down-sampling and up-sampling paths, incorporating GhostModuleV2, and incorporating a large kernel attention mechanism to better capture the boundaries and positions of backfat and eye muscle regions. The model can be used to segment these regions in breeding pigs and improve the loss function for accelerate convergence while remedying the low precision caused by class imbalance. Using a dataset of ultrasound images, the BEGV2-UNet model achieved an MIoU of 96.18 % and MPA of 98.12 %, with model size reduced to 18.69 MB and strong inference accuracy. We calculated the backfat thickness and eye muscle area using the model to achieve R2 values of 0.98 and 0.96, respectively. This study highlights the significant advantages of BEGV2-UNet in terms of image segmentation accuracy and lightweight design.

AB  - Background/Aims: Early life exposures to marine contaminants can adversely impact child health but modes of action are unclear. Human milk contains extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can transport biologically relevant cargo from mother to infant, including microRNAs (miRNAs), and may partly mediate the effects of pollutants on child health. However, the role of marine pollutants on miRNA expression in milk EVs is unexplored. Methods: We isolated EV RNA from 333 milk samples collected between 2 and 74 days postpartum from a Faroese birth cohort born 1997-2000 and sequenced 2083 miRNAs using a targeted library preparation method. We quantified five perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pesticide metabolite p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and the sum of three major polychlorinated biphenyls (Sigma PCBs) in maternal serum at 34 weeks of gestation and maternal hair total mercury (Hg) at birth. We used negative binomial regressions to estimate associations between individual pollutants and 418 reliably expressed EV-miRNAs adjusted for potential confounders. We performed sparse principal components (PCs) analysis to derive the first four components of the EV-miRNA data and examined associations between pollutants and PCs using Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR). Results: We observed no associations between pollutants and individual EV-miRNA expression after controlling the false discovery rate at 0.1. However, BKMR suggested that Hg was positively associated with PC1 and negatively associated with PC3, while Sigma PCBs was negatively associated with PC3, and two PFAS were associated with PC4. Exploration of PC loadings followed by pathway analyses suggested that miRNAs in PC1 (miR-200b3p, miR-664a-3p, miR-6738-5p, miR-429, miR-1236-5p, miR-4464, and miR-30b-5p) may be related to Hg neurotoxicity, while remaining PCs require further research. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that groups of milk EV-miRNAs may better serve as environmental biomarkers than individual miRNAs. Future studies are needed to elucidate the role of milk EV-miRNAs in child health following prenatal exposures.

AB  - During a recent inventory survey of the nematofauna of tea plantation at Zhejiang Province, China, Discocriconemella parasinensis n. sp. was detected in the rhizosphere of Camellia sinensis. The new species can be characterized by having the uninterrupted rounded labial disc, en face view showing rectangular-rounded labial plate without submedian lobes, R = 82.6 (80-86), Rex = 22 (21-23), stylet length of 68.3 (59-76) mu m, excretory pore located 1-2 annuli posterior to the esophageal bulb, vulva open, postvulval body elongated conoid, and tail conoid with bilobed terminus. Morphologically, the species shares the same lip-type with D. discolabia, D. mauritiensis, D. mineira, D. perseae, and D. sinensis. Phylogenetic relationships of the new species based on D2-D3 expansion segments of 28S, ITS, and 18S rRNA genes revealed that D. parasinensis n. sp. formed a separated Glade from other criconematid species, thereby supporting its status as a new species of the genus. The new species showed close phylogenetic relationships with Criconemoides geraerti.

Methods To explore the effect of a combination of living Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Streptococcus (CLB) on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and social rank, mice were subjected to a social dominance tube test (SDTT). The behaviors, rank, gut microbiota, and expression of inflammatory cytokines and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus were measured. Results The results indicated that CLB improved the SDTT ranking score of the losers and alleviated anxiety-like behaviors of the winners. CLB decreased the level of Desulfovibrio and augmented the level of Mollicutes in the feces, increased BDNF content, and reduced the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the hippocampus. Conclusion These findings indicated that CLB may be used for the treatment of anxiety and improvement of the rank score via regulation of gut microbiota and anti-inflammatory effects.

AB  - IntroductionVascular dementia (VaD) is a common type of dementia. The aim of this study was to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanism of conditioned medium (CM) in VaD.Material and methodsThe rats were divided into four groups of control (n = 9), sham-operation (n = 10), VaD with vehicle (n = 9), and VaD with CM (n = 12) that received CM on days 4, 14, and 24 after 2VO. Before sacrificing the rats, cognitive performance was assessed through the open-field (OP), passive-avoidance, and Morris-water maze. The field-potential recording was used to investigate basal synaptic transmission (BST) and long-term potentiation (LTP). Subsequently, the hippocampus was dissected, and real-time PCR was used to quantify the expression levels of beta 1-catenin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), and NR2B genes.ResultsThe results indicated impaired performance in behavioral tests in 2VO rats, coupled with reductions in BST and LTP induction. The expression levels of beta 1-catenin, IGF-1, PSD-95, and TGF-beta genes decreased, whereas NR2B and GSK-3 beta expression increased. Treatment with CM restores the expression of PSD-95 and GSK-3 beta as well as fear-memory, spatial learning, and grooming number without a positive effect on memory retrieval, time spent on the periphery and center of OP. The BST recovered upon administration of CM but, the LTP induction was still impaired.ConclusionThe recovery of BST in VaD rats appears to be the most important outcome of this study which is caused by the improvement of gene expression and leads to the restoration of fear memory.
   Vascular dementia (VaD) is a common type of dementia that occurs when there is damage to the blood vessels in the brain. While there is no cure for VaD, treatment focuses on managing underlying conditions and controlling risk factors. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the use of conditioned medium (CM) for the treatment of degenerative diseases. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanism of CM administration in VaD Our data indicated that treatment with CM led to the recovery of basal synaptic transmission and cognitive performance in VaD rats which is probably caused by the improvement of gene expression. image

AB  - Introduction: After calving, dairy cows are commonly affected by negative energy balance (NEB), indicated by high beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) blood levels. These are associated with subfertility frequently related to uterine inflammation. Since this could compromise functionality of endometrial glands that are essential for proper embryo implantation in sheep, we investigated effects of BHBA on bovine endometrial gland cells (BEGC) in vitro.Material and methods: BEGC were stimulated with different concentrations of BHBA over different periods. Cell metabolism and motility were examined by MTT-assay and Live-cell-imaging. The mRNA expression of the receptors for estrogen (ESR1, ESR2), progesterone (PR) and IFNr (IFNAR1, IFNAR2), and the inflammatory cytokines TNF alpha and IL-6 was determined by RT-qPCR. Protein expression for PR and ESR1 was analyzed by semiquantitative Western Blot.Results: BEGC metabolism was significantly decreased after stimulation with 1.2, 1.8 and 2.4 mM BHBA over 24 and 36 h. Cell motility was significantly reduced by 1.8 and 2.4 mM BHBA already after 11 h. After 24 h stimulation, the ESR1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in BEGC stimulated with 0.6 mM BHBA. PR and TNF alpha mRNA expressions were increased in cells stimulated with 2.4 mM BHBA. Protein expression of ESR1 and PR was not altered. Discussion: Treatment with BHBA leads to restriction of BEGC metabolism and motility, and increased expression of TNF alpha, ESR1 and PR in vitro. This could explain how increased BHBA blood levels might compromise functionality of uterine glands in vivo and thus could contribute to compromised reproductive success of cows suffering from NEB.

AB  - The master clock, suprachiasmatic nucleus, is believed to control peripheral circadian oscillators throughout the brain and body. However, recent data suggest there is a circadian clock involved in learning and memory, potentially housed in the hippocampus, which is capable of acting independently of the master clock. Curiously, the hippocampal clock appears to be influenced by the master clock and by hippocampal dependent learning, while under certain conditions it may also revert to its endogenous circadian rhythm. Here we propose a mechanism by which the hippocampal clock could locally determine the nature of its entrainment. We introduce a novel theoretical framework, inspired by but extending beyond the hippocampal memory clock, which provides a new perspective on how circadian clocks throughout the brain coordinate their rhythms. Importantly, a local clock for memory would suggest that hippocampal-dependent learning at the same time every day should improve memory, opening up a range of possibilities for non-invasive therapies to alleviate the detrimental effects of circadian rhythm disruption on human health.

AB  - Context contributes to multiple aspects of human episodic memory including segmentation and retrieval. The present studies tested if, in adult male and female mice, context influences the encoding of odors encountered in a single unsupervised sampling session of the type used for the routine acquisition of episodic memories. The three paradigms used differed in complexity (single vs. multiple odor cues) and period from sampling to testing. Results show that males consistently encode odors in a context-dependent manner: the mice discriminated novel from previously sampled cues when tested in the chamber of initial cue sampling but not in a distinct yet familiar chamber. This was independent of the interval between cue encounters or the latency from initial sampling to testing. In contrast, female mice acquired both single cues and the elements of multi-cue episodes, but recall of that information was dependent upon the surrounding context only when the cues were presented serially. These results extend the list of episodic memory features expressed by rodents and also introduce a striking and unexpected sex difference in context effects.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) spread in the food system is a major threat to public and animal health. We describe AMR trends in zoonotic bacteria and identify risk factors associated with AMR occurrence in animals and derived food in Portugal. Data from the Portuguese AMR surveillance programme on food-producing animals, 2014-2018, were used. AMR frequencies were calculated for Escherichia coli, Campylobacter and Salmonella in broilers, turkeys, pig populations and their derived food products. AMR-associated factors were studied for Salmonella isolates: population, sampling stage (farm, slaughterhouse and processing plant), sample type (environmental, carcase and food), sampler (HACCP, industry, official and official and industry), sample context (control and eradication programmes and monitoring), year (2014-2018) and season. Logistic regression was applied to estimate crude odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The final models were obtained using a backward stepwise method. This study included 2,157 Escherichia coli, 561 Campylobacter and 1,071 Salmonella isolates. The highest prevalence estimates amongst tested antimicrobials for each bacterial species in 2014-2018 had the following ranges: (i) (fluoro)quinolones: E. coli: 84%-93%, Campylobacter: 94%-98%; (ii) tetracyclines: E. coli: 68%-91%, Campylobacter: 87%-91%, Salmonella: 72%; (iii) penicillins: E. coli: 82%-100%; (iv) sulphonamides: E. coli: 68%-82%. Compared with the reference categories for host (broiler), year (2014), season (winter) and sampler (HACCP own checks), resistance to at least one antimicrobial in Salmonella was significantly less likely in laying hens (aOR 0.28; 95% CI: 0.18-0.42), 2016 (aOR 0.56; 95% CI: 0.33-0.93), 2017 (aOR 0.29; 95% CI: 0.17-0.51) and 2018 (aOR 0.35; 95% CI: 0.20-0.61), autumn (aOR 0.63; 95% CI: 0.40-0.97) and more likely to occur in broiler products (aOR 5.14; 95% CI: 2.61-10.54), pork products (aOR 6.84; 95% CI: 3.74-12.98) and official and industry combined sampling (aOR 2.16; 95% CI: 1.06-4.47). This study reveals a high prevalence of Salmonella resistance, especially during the summer and in post-farm stages of the Portuguese food system to nearly all antimicrobials and in the summer in farms to (fluoro)quinolones. Measures to tackle resistance are required.

Cardiac acclimatization at high altitude in two different ethnicity groups. High Alt Med Biol. 22:58-69, 2021.
   Introduction: High altitude (HA) exposure causes substantial increase in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and resistance. However, the effects of HA hypoxia exposure on cardiac function remain incompletely understood. Studies evaluating interethnic differences in cardiac functions in response to HA exposure are lacking. We aimed to compare the cardiac performance in Indian versus Kyrgyz healthy lowland subjects over the course of a 3-week HA exposure at 4,111 m.
   Methodology: Ten Indians and 20 Kyrgyz subjects were studied to assess cardiac acclimatization noninvasively by echocardiography in two different ethnic groups for 3 weeks of stay at HA. Pulmonary hemodynamics, right and left ventricular functions were evaluated at basal and on days 3, 7, 14, and 21 of HA exposure and on day 3 of deinduction.
   Results: HA exposure significantly increased PAP, pulmonary vascular resistance, cardiac output (CO), and heart rates (HRs) in both groups. Tricuspid regurgitant gradient increased significantly in both the group at day 3 versus basal; 38.9 mmHg (31.8, 42.9) versus 21.9 mmHg (19.5, 22.6) in Kyrgyz; and 34.1 mmHg (30.2, 38.5) versus 20.4 mmHg (19.7, 21.3) in Indians. HR increased significantly in Indians at day 3 and 7, whereas in Kyrgyz throughout exposure. CO increased significantly in both groups at day 3 versus basal with 5.9 L/min (5.5, 6.4) versus 5.1 L/min (4.4, 5.9) in Kyrgyz, and 5.7 L/min (5.56, 5.98) versus 4.9 L/min (4.1, 5.3) in Indians. Both groups exhibited preserved right ventricular diastolic and systolic functions at HAs. HA exposure changed the left ventricular diastolic parameters only in Kyrgyz subjects with impaired mitral inflow E/A, but not in Indian subjects. All cardiac changes induced at HAs have been recovered fully upon deinduction in both, except lateral-septal A ', which remained low in Indians.
   Conclusion: Although pulmonary hemodynamics responses were similar in both groups, there were differences in cardiac functional parameters between the two in response to HA exposure that may be accounted to ethnic variation.

TI  - Aminated Lignin/Cellulose-Based Hydrogel with High Adhesion for Wearable Sensors

AB  - Hydrogels play a significant role in the flexibility, stretchability, and conductivity of wearable sensors. However, it is still a challenge to achieve multifunctional hydrogel sensors with excellent mechanical strength, outstanding self-adhesion, and high stimulus responsiveness for meeting various demands of practical applications. Here, this work presents a one-pot method to prepare a conductive hydrogel with multifunction by introducing aminated lignosulfonate (A-LS) and aminated cellulose nanocrystals (A-CNC) into the hydrogel matrix. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of dynamic reversible noncovalent bond network with the introduction of nanoparticles in the system, the resultant hydrogel showed excellent mechanical properties. In addition, the prepared hydrogels exhibited remarkable adhesion strength (pig skin: 24 kPa) with sustainable adhesion, which still maintained an adhesion strength above 18 kPa after 20 cycles of adhesion/separation. The resultant hydrogel sensor showed a wide operating range (0-200%), high sensitivity (GF = 0.71 at 0-100% strain; GF = 3.15 at 100-200% strain), and fast response time (320 ms). The high-value utilization of renewable forest biomass resources is conducive to the sustainable development of green chemistry.

AB  - Introduction Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with higher risk of cognitive impairment. Until now, little is known about the effect of anesthetics on cognitive function in PD patients. The imbalance of hippocampal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors NR2A/NR2B subunit ratio is reported to be associated with memory dysfunction in PD rats. The current study investigated the effects of propofol on the cognitive function and hippocampal NR2A/NR2B ratio in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD rat model.Methods MPTP was stereotaxically injected into the substantia nigra pars compacta of male Wistar rats. Next day (day 2), the rats in the chronic intervention groups were injected daily with either propofol (80 mg/kg/day, i.p.) or fat emulsion for 7 days (day 2-8). The rats in the acute intervention groups received propofol or fat emulsion only on day 8. Then, all the rats underwent an open field test and an inhibitory avoidance (IA) test. At last, the rats were killed for histological analysis and hippocampal NR2A and NR2B proteins and mRNA level quantification.Results Neither acute nor chronic treatment with propofol can significantly change the impairment of locomotor activity and dopaminergic denervation of the striatum in MPTP-lesioned rats. MPTP lesioning caused IA memory impairment, which was aggravated by chronic treatment with propofol. Furthermore, chronic treatment with propofol also aggravated the imbalance of hippocampal NR2A/NR2B ratio in MPTP-lesioned rats.Discussion The current findings indicate that chronic propofol treatment exacerbated MPTP-induced inhibitory avoidance (IA) memory impairment and aggravated the imbalance of hippocampal NR2A/NR2B ratio in MPTP-lesioned rats. Our current data demonstrate a correlation, not direct causation, between NR2A/NR2B dysregulation and cognitive impairment. Future studies should probe whether this imbalance is a driver or consequence of synaptic dysfunction.

AB  - The number of children born after assisted reproductive technology (ART) is accumulating rapidly, and the health problems of the children are extensively concerned. This study aims to evaluate whether ART procedures alter behaviours in male offspring. Mouse models were utilized to establish three groups of offspring conceived by natural conception (NC), in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET), and frozen-thawed embryo transfer (IVF-FET), respectively. A battery of behaviour experiments for evaluating anxiety and depression levels, including the open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze (EPM) test, light/dark transition test (L/DTT), tail suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST), and sucrose preference test (SPT) was carried out. Aged (18 months old), but not young (3 months old), male offspring in the IVF-ET and IVF-FET groups, compared with those in the NC group, exhibited increased anxiety and depression-like behaviours. The protein expression levels of three neurotrophins in PFC or hippocampus in aged male offspring from the IVF-ET and IVF-FET groups reduced at different extent, in comparison to NC group. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed in the hippocampus of 18 months old offspring to further explore the gene expression profile changes in the three groups. KEGG analyses revealed the coexisted pathways, such as PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, which potentially reflected the similarity and divergence in anxiety and depression between the offspring conceived by IVF-ET and IVF-FET. Our research suggested the adverse effects of advanced age on the psychological health of children born after ART should be highlighted in the future.

AB  - Metaheuristic algorithms are important methods for solving practical optimization problems. Accurate, efficient, and stable metaheuristic algorithms have become the main goal of optimization research. Hippopotamus optimization algorithm (HO) is a new algorithm with good optimization effect proposed by three biological behaviors of hippopotamus: position change, defense, and avoidance of predators. However, due to the many restrictions of hippopotamus itself and the incomplete exploitation of hippopotamus' physiological functions, in the exploration and exploitation stages, the parameter settings are single and limited in range, and the position change strategies under different conditions are less different, resulting in the algorithm's limited search ability, tendency to converge prematurely and fall into the local optimal trap, poor exploration accuracy, and other shortcomings, making it impossible to obtain good results when facing optimization problems. In response to these shortcomings, this paper proposes a multi-strategy Hippopotamus optimization algorithm (MSHO), which achieves better performance by introducing three strategy improvement methods: adaptive perturbation optimization, autonomous optimal screening and new avoidance and defense. The effectiveness of MSHO is verified by comparing it with 10 excellent algorithms on the two test sets of CEC2017 and CEC2020. MSHO ranked first in the Friedman test results of the two experimental test sets, and in the two test sets, the optimization effect of MSHO was improved by 47.21% and 45.66%, respectively, compared with HO. Parameter perturbation analysis experiments were conducted, and the optimization effect of the improved strategy on the algorithm was obtained through ablation experiments. In addition, feature selection (FS) helps to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis in fields such as engineering design and image analysis. In order to verify that MSHO has good effects in FS applications, it was compared with 10 excellent algorithms on 23 FS data sets. The Friedman test results of MSHO on 23 experimental FS data sets show that the optimization effect of MSHO is also better than other comparison algorithms, and the optimization effect is improved by 32.11% compared with HO, proving that MSHO performs better than the original HO and other comparison algorithms in the application of FS. MSHO and HO are tested for exploration and exploitation balance and population diversity, and it is finally concluded that MSHO has good stability and population diversity.

AB  - Introduction To investigate the heterogeneous effect of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype on clinical phenotypes in early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), respectively. Methods 785 probable AD patients were enrolled from the dementia cohort of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH), China. There were 386 EOAD and 399 LOAD cases. All individuals finished history inquiry, neurological examination, blood biochemical test, neuropsychological screening test, electroencephalography, brain CT/MRI, and ApoE genotyping. Some participants had neuropsychological domain assessment (n = 317), MRI morphometry (n = 130), CSF testing of A beta 42, p-tau, t-tau (n = 144), or DNA sequencing (n = 690). The variables were compared mainly between e4 carriers and non-carriers in EOAD and LOAD, respectively. Results In LOAD, e4 carriers showed female predominance; worse performance in trail making test, delayed recall of auditory verbal learning test (AVLT) and rey complex figure; smaller hippocampal, parahippocampal, and entorhinal volume, as compared to e4 non-carriers. In EOAD, e4 carriers had lower scores in AVLT, episodic memory and modified Luria's tapping task; but less cortical atrophy in entorhinal, middle cingulate, inferior frontal, and parieto-occipital regions, in comparison to e4 non-carriers. 6.2% (43/690) subjects harbored potential causative mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2. In both EOAD and LOAD, no differences were observed between e4 carriers and non-carriers in CSF levels of A beta 42, p-tau, t-tau, or mutation frequency. Conclusions ApoE exerts a heterogeneous effect on clinical phenotypes in EOAD and LOAD, which might be related to the different genetic and pathological basis underlying them.

AB  - IntroductionCognitive impairment includes the abnormality of learning, memory and judgment, resulting in severe learning and memory impairment and social activity impairment, which greatly affects the life quality of individuals. However, the specific mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in different behavioral paradigms remain to be elucidated. MethodsThe study utilized two behavioral paradigms, novel location recognition (NLR) and novel object recognition (NOR), to investigate the brain regions involved in cognitive function. These tests comprised two phases: mice were presented with two identical objects for familiarization during the training phase, and a novel (experiment) or familiar (control) object/location was presented during testing. Immunostaining quantification of c-Fos, an immediate early gene used as a neuronal activity marker, was performed in eight different brain regions after the NLR or NOR test. ResultsThe number of c-Fos-positive cells was significantly higher in the dorsal part of the lateral septal nucleus (LSD) in the NLR and dentate gyrus (DG) in the NOR experiment group than in the control group. We further bilaterally lesioned these regions using excitotoxic ibotenic acid and replenished the damaged areas using an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) strategy. DiscussionThese data reinforced the importance of LSD and DG in regulating spatial and object recognition memory, respectively. Thus, the study provides insight into the roles of these brain regions and suggests potential intervention targets for impaired spatial and object recognition memory.

AB  - Background: Female infertility is a health issue for both humans and animals and despite developments in medical interventions, there are still some conditions that cannot be treated successfully. It is important to explore other potential therapies or remedies that could improve reproductive health. Choline is an over-the-counter supplement and essential nutrient that has many health benefits. It has been suggested to be beneficial in various aspects of fertility, including fetal development and endocrine disorders like polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). However, choline's impact on ovarian function has not been explored. Methods: To study the effects of choline on ovarian development, 36 female Yorkshire x Landrace pigs were fed the following four supplemented diets between 90 and 186 days of age: (1) Control (corn and soybean meal-based diet that met estimated nutrient requirements, n = 9); (2) Choline (additional 500 mg choline per 1 kg of control diet, n = 8); (3) Omega-3 (additional 5556 mg Omega-3 per 1 kg control diet by introducing fish oil); (4) Choline + Omega-3 (500 mg choline + 5556 mg Omega-3 per 1 kg control diet). Pigs fed the choline-supplemented diet were compared to the control group and those fed diets supplemented with Omega-3 as fertility-promoting agent. Results: It was found that the number of corpus luteum per ovary in the Choline (16.25 +/- 2.88), Omega-3 (10.78 +/- 1.71) and Choline + Omega-3 (14.89 +/- 2.97) groups were all higher in comparison to that of the control group (5.56 +/- 1.72, p < 0.05). The percentage of antral follicles in the Choline + Omega-3 group were higher compared to the control group (p < 0.05). To elucidate the potential molecular mechanism of choline on these improved ovarian phenotypes, the expression of a group of genes that are involved in ovarian development, including cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily A member 1 (CYP11A1), follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FHSR) and luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR), was analyzed using RT-qPCR. The expression of both LHR and CYP11A1 was significantly upregulated in the choline-supplemented group (p < 0.05), while there are no differences in FSHR expression among all the groups. Additionally, the expression of miR-21, -378, -574, previously found to be important in ovarian function, were examined. Our data showed that miR-574 was upregulated in the Choline group while miR-378 was upregulated in the Choline + Omega-3 group in comparison to the control group (p < 0.05). Further, serum metabolite analysis showed that 1-(5Z, 8Z, 11Z, 14Z, 17Z-eicosapentaenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, a form of phosphatidylcholine metabolite, was significantly increased in all the treatment groups (p < 0.05), while testosterone was significantly increased in both Omega-3 and Choline + Omega-3 groups (p < 0.05) and tended to be reduced in the choline-supplemented group (p = 0.08) compared to the control group. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated choline's influence on ovarian function in vivo, and offered insights into the mechanisms behind its positive effect on ovarian development phenotype.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are promising molecules to address the global antibiotic resistance problem, however, optimization to achieve favorable potency and safety is required. Here, a peptide-template modification approach was employed to design physicochemical variants based on net charge, hydrophobicity, enantiomer, and terminal group. All variants of the scorpion venom peptide BmKn-2 with amphipathic alpha-helical cationic structure exhibited an increased antibacterial potency when evaluated against multidrug-resistant Salmonella isolates at a MIC range of 4-8 mu M. They revealed antibiofilm activity in a dose-dependent manner. Sheep red blood cells were used to evaluate hemolytic and cell selectivity properties. Peptide Kn2-5R-NH2, dKn2-5R-NH2, and 2F-Kn2-5R-NH2 (variants with +6 charges carrying amidated C-terminus) showed stronger antibacterial activity than Kn2-5R (a variant with +5 charges bearing free-carboxyl group at C-terminus). Peptide dKn2-5R-NH2 (d-enantiomer) exhibited slightly weaker antibacterial activity with much less hemolytic activity (higher hemolytic concentration 50) than Kn2-5R-NH2 (l-enantiomer). Furthermore, peptide Kn2-5R with the least hydrophobicity had the lowest hemolytic activity and showed the highest specificity to Salmonella (the highest selectivity index). This study also explained the relationship of peptide physicochemical properties and bioactivities that would fulfill and accelerate progress in peptide antibiotic research and development.

AB  - A new method to quantitatively analyze heterogeneous distributions of local proton densities around paramagnetic centers in unstructured and weakly structured biomacromolecules and soft matter is introduced, and its feasibility is demonstrated on aqueous solutions of stochastically spin-labeled polysaccharides. This method is based on the pulse EPR experiment ih-RIDME (intermolecular hyperfine relaxation-induced dipolar modulation enhancement). Global analysis of a series of RIDME traces allows for a mathematically stable transformation of the time-domain data to the distribution of local proton concentrations. Two pulse sequences are proposed and tested, which combine the ih-RIDME block and the double-electron-electron resonance (DEER) experiment. Such experiments can be potentially used to correlate the local proton concentration with the macromolecular chain conformation. We anticipate an application of this approach in studies of intrinsically disordered proteins, biomolecular aggregates, and biomolecular condensates.

AB  - The processes that determine the establishment of the complex morphology of neurons during development are still poorly understood. Here, we focus on the question how a difference in the length of neurites affects vesicle transport. We performed live imaging experiments and present a lattice-based model to gain a deeper theoretical understanding of intracellular transport in neurons. After a motivation and appropriate scaling of the model we present numerical simulations showing that initial differences in neurite length result in phenomena of biological relevance, i.e. a positive feedback that enhances transport into the longer neurite and oscillation of vesicles concentrations that can be interpreted as cycles of extension and retraction observed in experiments. Thus, our model is a first step towards a better understanding of the interplay between the transport of vesicles and the spatial organization of cells.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce a novel method for classifying and computing the frequencies of movement modes of intraspecific and interspecific dyads, focusing in particular on distance-mediated approach, retreat, following and side-by-side movement modes. Besides distance, other factors such as time of day, season, sex or age can be included in the analysis to assess whether they cause frequencies of movement modes to deviate from random. By subdividing the data according to selected factors, our method allows us to identify those responsible for (or correlated with) significant differences in the behaviour of dyadic pairs. We demonstrate and validate our method using both simulated and empirical data. Our simulated data were obtained from a relative-motion, biased random-walk (RM-BRW) model with attraction and repulsion components. Our empirical data were GPS relocation data collected from African elephants in Etosha National Park, Namibia. The simulated data were primarily used to validate our method while the empirical data were used to illustrate the types of behavioural assessment that our methodology reveals. Our method facilitates automated, observer-bias-free analysis of the locomotive interactions of dyads using GPS relocation data, which are becoming increasingly ubiquitous as telemetry and related technologies improve. It should open up a whole new vista of behavioural-interaction type analyses to movement and behavioural ecologists.

AB  - Plastics breaking down of larger plastics into smaller ones (microplastics and nanoplastic) as potential threats to the ecosystem. Previous studies demonstrate that the central nervous system (CNS) is a vulnerable target of nanoplastics. However, the potentially epigenetic biomarkers of nanoplastic neurotoxicity in rodent models are still unknown. The present research aimed to determine the role of competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) in the process of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS NPs) exposure-induced nerve injury. The study was designed to inves-tigate whether 25 nm PS NPs could cause learning dysfunction and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms in mice. A total of 40 mice were divided into 4 groups and were exposed to PS NPs (0, 10, 25, 50 mg/kg). Chronic toxicity was introduced in mice by administration of oral gavage for 6 months. The evaluation included assessment of their behavior, pathological investigation and determination of the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage. RNA-Seq was performed to detect the expression levels of circRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs in PFC samples of mice treated with 0 and 50 mg/kg PS NPs. The results indicated that exposure of mice to PS NPs caused a dose-dependent cognitive decline. ROS levels and DNA damage were increased in the PFC following exposure of the mice to PS NPs. A total of 987 mRNAs, 29 miRNAs and 67 circRNAs demonstrated significant differences between the 0 and 50 mg/kg PS NPs groups. Functional enrichment analyses indicated that PS NPs may induce major injury in the synaptic function. A total of 96 mRNAs, which were associated with synaptic dysfunction were identified. A competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network containing 27 circRNAs, 19 miRNAs and 35 synaptic dysfunction-related mRNAs was constructed. The present study provided insight into the molecular events associated with nanoplastic toxicity and induction of cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Hydrogels have become an important material in the field of wearable flexible electronics owing to their excellent flexibility and adjustable conductivity. However, due to the large amount of free water contained within the hydrogel, it freezes in low-temperature environments, resulting in poor conductivity and mechanical properties. In this study, an ionically conductive hydrogel was developed by introducing phytic acid (PA), a biomass-based antifreezing material. The addition of PA improved the mechanical, adhesion, and electrical properties, as well as the frost resistance of the hydrogel. The PAM/PVA0.15/Gelatin0.02/PA4 hydrogel prepared in this study exhibited an ultrahigh tensile strain (3083%), excellent adhesion (with adhesion strength to pig skin up to 448.45 kPa), and high conductivity (10.07 S m-1). At the same time, PA endowed the hydrogel with good frost resistance and long-term environmental stability. The hydrogel could remain soft even at -20 degrees C, as well as retain good electrical properties. In addition, an integrated hydrogel sensor exhibited a wide strain response range (1-1000%), excellent stability, and high sensitivity. Moreover, hydrogel sensors were also successfully used for motion and pipeline flow rate monitoring, as well as simple human-computer interaction applications.

AB  - Simple Summary This study explored how retinal vasculature changes during central hypovolemia induced by lower body negative pressure (LBNP). LBNP is known to shift blood to the lower body and is routinely employed to assess the effects of central hypovolemia and/or to simulate the effects of hemorrhage on systems physiology. In this study, retinal imaging was carried out in participants of both sexes as they underwent LBNP. Surprisingly, no significant changes were observed in retinal blood flow between time points or across the sexes. This study is the first in this field, shedding light on retinal response during a moderate LBNP of -40 mmHg, which induces fluid shifts and evokes systematic physiological responses like those that occur during upright standing. However, further research is needed with stronger LBNP levels, including those that can induce pre-fainting (presyncope) states, to fully understand how retinal microcirculation adapts during complete cardiovascular collapse (e.g., during hypovolemic shock) and/or during severe hemorrhage.Abstract Introduction: Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) is routinely used to induce central hypovolemia. LBNP leads to a shift in blood to the lower extremities. While the effects of LBNP on physiological responses and large arteries have been widely reported, there is almost no literature regarding how these cephalad fluid shifts affect the microvasculature. The present study evaluated the changes in retinal microcirculation parameters induced by LBNP in both males and females. Methodology: Forty-four participants were recruited for the present study. The retinal measurements were performed at six time points during the LBNP protocol. To prevent the development of cardiovascular collapse (syncope) in the healthy participants, graded LBNP until a maximum of -40 mmHg was applied. A non-mydriatic, hand-held Optomed Aurora retinal camera was used to capture the retinal images. MONA Reva software (version 2.1.1) was used to analyze the central retinal arterial and venous diameter changes during the LBNP application. Repeated measures ANOVAs, including sex as the between-subjects factor and the grade of the LBNP as the within-subjects factor, were performed. Results: No significant changes in retinal microcirculation were observed between the evaluated time points or across the sexes. Conclusions: Graded LBNP application did not lead to changes in the retinal microvasculature across the sexes. The present study is the first in the given area that attempted to capture the changes in retinal microcirculation caused by central hypovolemia during LBNP. However, further research is needed with higher LBNP levels, including those that can induce pre-fainting (presyncope), to fully understand how retinal microcirculation adapts during complete cardiovascular collapse (e.g., during hypovolemic shock) and/or during severe hemorrhage.

AB  - Simple Summary Heat waves can have fatal effects on arthropods such as insects and mites since their heat tolerance is often lower than the diurnal maximum temperatures during heat waves. Plastic modifications by the parents, however, can rapidly result in favorable adaptations in offspring traits. This question was investigated by using a prominent natural enemy/pest couple in biological control, the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis and its prey, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae. We exposed both species separately to extreme or mild heat waves during their juvenile development, a vital phase of arthropod life, for two generations and assessed various fitness-relevant parameters of the offspring generation. Under extreme heat waves, adult body sizes of predator and prey males and prey females were insensitive, when they derived from parents also reared under extreme heat waves. Irrespective of their origin, offspring reached earlier adulthood under extreme heat waves. In general, prey benefitted more from parental modifications compared to the predator. However, further investigations are needed to verify whether these changes affect the interactions between the predators and their prey to an extent that it may jeopardize biological control during extreme heat waves. Theoretically, parents can adjust vital offspring traits to the irregular and rapid occurrence of heat waves via developmental plasticity. However, the direction and strength of such trait modifications are often species-specific. Here, we investigated within-generational plasticity (WGP) and trans-generational plasticity (TGP) effects induced by heat waves during the offspring development of the predator Phytoseiulus persimilis and its herbivorous prey, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, to assess plastic developmental modifications. Single offspring individuals with different parental thermal origin (reared under mild or extreme heat waves) of both species were exposed to mild or extreme heat waves until adulthood, and food consumption, age and size at maturity were recorded. The offspring traits were influenced by within-generational plasticity (WGP), trans-generational plasticity (TGP), non-plastic trans-generational effects (TGE) and/or their interactions. When exposed to extreme heat waves, both species speeded up development (exclusively WGP), consumed more (due to the fact of WGP but also to TGP in prey females and to non-plastic TGE in predator males), and predator females got smaller (non-plastic TGE and WGP), whereas prey males and females were equally sized irrespective of their origin, because TGE, WGP and TGP acted in opposite directions. The body sizes of predator males were insensitive to parental and offspring heat wave conditions. Species comparisons indicated stronger reductions in the developmental time and reduced female predator-prey body size ratios in favor of the prey under extreme heat waves. Further investigations are needed to evaluate, whether trait modifications result in lowered suppression success of the predator on its prey under heat waves or not.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As a type of biological control agent (BCA), Bacillus velezensis possesses the efficacy of inhibiting pathogenic microorganisms, promoting plant growth, and overcoming continuous cropping obstacles (CCOs). However, there is limited reporting on the optimization of the cultivation conditions for such biocontrol agents and their role as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) delivery vectors. RESULTS: In this study, a Bacillus velezensis strain HS-3 was isolated from the root zone of tomato plants with in vitro anti-Botrytis cinerea activity. The investigation into active compounds revealed that HS-3 predominantly employs proteins with molecular weights greater than 3 kDa for its antifungal activity. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis identified various proteases and chitosanase, further suggesting that HS-3 most likely employs these enzymes to degrade fungal cell walls for its antifungal effect. To optimize the production of extracellular proteins, fermentation parameters for HS-3 were systematically optimized, leading to an optimized medium (OP-M). HS-3 cultured in OP-M demonstrated enhanced capacity to assist tomato plants in withstanding CCOs. However, the presence of excessive nematodes in diseased soil resulted in the disease severity index (DSI) remaining high. An RNA interference mechanism was further introduced to HS-3, targeting the nematode tyrosine phosphatase (TP) gene. Ultimately, HS-3 expressing dsRNA of TP in OP-M effectively assisted tomatoes in mitigating CCOs, reducing DSI to 2.2% and 17.8% of the control after 45 and 90 days of growth, respectively. CONCLUSION: The advantages of Bacillus velezensis in crop disease management and the mitigation of CCOs become even more pronounced when utilizing both optimized levels of endogenous enzymes and introduced nematode-targeting dsRNA.

AB  - Introduction and Objective. The hygienic status of arable soils in most developed countries has been unknown. In the presented study, a preliminary investigation was undertaken to determine the contamination with eggs of parasitic nematodes in the soil of arable fields in Poland. The aim of the study was to determine whether such contamination is common enough to constitute a significant problem and what factors may influence it.
   Materials and method. The study was conducted in 5 Polish provinces from autumn 2021 to spring 2022. The provinces differed significantly in terms of the area of agricultural land, agricultural suitability, type of soil, scale of cattle and pig breeding, production of manure and slurry, and the use of manures and organic fertilizers for fertilization. A total of 133 soil samples were collected. Parasitological examination of soil samples was carried out using the PN-Z-19006 method [1], with confirmed high sensitivity.
   Results. Parasite eggs were found in a total of 67 samples, of which 56 samples contained eggs of roundworms of the genus Ascaris (an average of 3.29 eggs/100 g of soil), 23 contained eggs of whipworms (an average of 1.22 eggs/100 g), and 3 contained eggs of Toxocara (1 egg/100 g).
   Conclusions. Differences in the percentage of positive samples were found depending on the period in which the samples were taken. The percentage of positive samples collected in autumn (53.57%) was higher than the percentage of positive samples collected in spring (48.05%). Similarly, the average number of eggs of in positive samples collected in autumn (3.43 eggs/100 g) was higher than the average number of eggs in samples collected in spring (2.90 eggs/100 g). Differences in the percentage of positive samples were also found depending on the region of origin of the samples.

AB  - Simple Summary The quality and yield of pork are significantly affected by the development and growth of porcine skeletal muscle. To identify the genetic factors that underlie this biological process, we initiated a study focusing on transposable elements (TEs). Due to their capacity of self-replication and relocation within the host genome, TEs play an important role in shaping the genome regulatory landscape. By utilizing extensive transcriptomic data spanning 27 developmental stages of porcine skeletal muscle, we created a comprehensive atlas of TE expression, revealing the intricate relationship between active TEs and epigenetic modifications. Through gene co-expression network analysis and the integration of multi-omics data, we uncovered a TE-mediated genetic regulatory network governing the development and growth of skeletal muscle. This research not only identifies valuable candidate genes for the genetic improvement of the economic traits of pork but also introduces an innovative TE-centric approach for dissecting the genetic factors contributing to complex traits.Abstract The development and growth of porcine skeletal muscle determine pork quality and yield. While genetic regulation of porcine skeletal muscle development has been extensively studied using various omics data, the role of transposable elements (TEs) in this context has been less explored. To bridge this gap, we constructed a comprehensive atlas of TE expression throughout the developmental stages of porcine skeletal muscle. This was achieved by integrating porcine TE genomic coordinates with whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq data from 27 developmental stages. We discovered that in pig skeletal muscle, active Tes are closely associated with active epigenomic marks, including low levels of DNA methylation, high levels of chromatin accessibility, and active histone modifications. Moreover, these TEs include 6074 self-expressed TEs that are significantly enriched in terms of muscle cell development and myofibril assembly. Using the TE expression data, we conducted a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and identified a module that is significantly associated with muscle tissue development as well as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the signals of pig meat and carcass traits. Within this module, we constructed a TE-mediated gene regulatory network by adopting a unique multi-omics integration approach. This network highlighted several established candidate genes associated with muscle-relevant traits, including HES6, CHRNG, ACTC1, CHRND, MAMSTR, and PER2, as well as novel genes like ENSSSCG00000005518, ENSSSCG00000033601, and PIEZO2. These novel genes hold promise for regulating muscle-related traits in pigs. In summary, our research not only enhances the TE-centered dissection of the genetic basis underlying pork production traits, but also offers a general approach for constructing TE-mediated regulatory networks to study complex traits or diseases.

AB  - Introduction: Existing strategies to control porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) are not completely effective and require alternative approaches. Although intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) fetuses are more resilient to transplacental PRRS virus-2 (PRRSV2) infection compared to normal fetuses, the exact mechanisms are unknown. The objective of this research was to assess abundance and localization of a subset of tight junction (TJ) proteins in the maternal-fetal interface and any alterations that may affect the movement of nutrients or PRRSV2 across the epitheliochorial placenta.
   Methods: Paraffin-embedded samples of placenta from non-infected control (CTRL) and PRRSV2 infected fetuses (IUGR, non(N)-IUGR, meconium-stained (MEC) (n = 6 per group) were randomly selected from a large challenge trial and immunostained for claudins (CLDN) 1, 3, 4, 7 and tight junction protein 1 (TJP1). Immunostaining intensity was semi-subjectively scored by region.
   Results: Intensity of CLDN1 was lower in placenta of IUGR, MEC, and N-IUGR fetuses compared to CTRL, mainly in fetal epithelium and maternal endothelial cells (MECL). CLDN4 intensity was lower in MECL of IUGR compared to CTRL and MEC fetuses. TJP1 intensity was lower in maternal and fetal epithelia of placenta within IUGR, MEC, and N-IUGR fetuses versus CTRL.
   Discussion: Differences were mainly observed between PRRSV2 infected and non-infected groups indicating TJ integrity was affected by PRRSV2 infection. These results provide insights into the potential mechanisms of transplacental transmission of PRRSV2; however, since only CLDN4 differed amongst the infected groups, PRRSV2 induced changes in TJ integrity do not appear to explain variation in fetal outcomes after infection.

AB  - In rodent behavior research, observer-independent methods, such as the IntelliCage, enhance data collection in a social, and thus stress-reduced, environment. The IntelliCage system allows experimenters to create cognitive challenges for mice motivated by rewards. Given the extensive and diverse data from IntelliCage, there is a high demand for automated analysis. Here, we introduce IntelliR, a free and standardized pipeline for analyzing IntelliCage data, including a cognition index for performance comparison across challenges. IntelliR supports the automatic analysis of three challenges that cover spatial, episodic-like, and working memory with their reversal tests and can also be adapted for other designs. Results from three cohorts of adult female C57B6 mice showed improved task proficiency over time. To validate cognitive impairment detection, we used adult female NexCreERT2xRosa26-eGFP-DTA mice after neuron ablation in cortex and hippocampus, in which we observed reduced learning capabilities. IntelliR integrates easily into research, improving time management and reproducibility.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is a crop of high economic value, yet it is particularly susceptible to various diseases and pests that significantly reduce its yield and quality. Consequently, the precise segmentation and classification of diseased Camellia leaves are vital for managing pests and diseases effectively. Deep learning exhibits significant advantages in the segmentation of plant diseases and pests, particularly in complex image processing and automated feature extraction. However, when employing single-modal models to segment Camellia oleifera diseases, three critical challenges arise: (A) lesions may closely resemble the colors of the complex background; (B) small sections of diseased leaves overlap; (C) the presence of multiple diseases on a single leaf. These factors considerably hinder segmentation accuracy. A novel multimodal model, CNN-Transformer Dual U-shaped Network (CTDUNet), based on a CNN-Transformer architecture, has been proposed to integrate image and text information. This model first utilizes text data to address the shortcomings of single-modal image features, enhancing its ability to distinguish lesions from environmental characteristics, even under conditions where they closely resemble one another. Additionally, we introduce Coordinate Space Attention (CSA), which focuses on the positional relationships between targets, thereby improving the segmentation of overlapping leaf edges. Furthermore, cross-attention (CA) is employed to align image and text features effectively, preserving local information and enhancing the perception and differentiation of various diseases. The CTDUNet model was evaluated on a self-made multimodal dataset compared against several models, including DeeplabV3+, UNet, PSPNet, Segformer, HrNet, and Language meets Vision Transformer (LViT). The experimental results demonstrate that CTDUNet achieved an mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 86.14%, surpassing both multimodal models and the best single-modal model by 3.91% and 5.84%, respectively. Additionally, CTDUNet exhibits high balance in the multi-class segmentation of Camellia oleifera diseases and pests. These results indicate the successful application of fused image and text multimodal information in the segmentation of Camellia disease, achieving outstanding performance.

AB  - The nectar provision hypothesis predicts that the introduction of nectar-producing plants in agroecosystems benefits parasitoid populations in the field and enhances biological control. Intercropping is a common crop diversification scheme that may bring complementary nectar sources for parasitoids and increase herbivore pest control. For instance, intercropping cereals with faba beans introduces nectar sources in usually sugar-devoid systems (i.e. cereal single crops). However, the nectar provision hypothesis has never been evaluated at the field scale in such intercropping systems. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated if sugar is a limiting factor for Aphidius parasitoids in single triticale crops and if their nectar feeding activity increases in faba bean-triticale intercrops. Aphidius feeding patterns were evaluated from their sugar profiles, using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In parallel, aphid density and parasitism rates were estimated at the edge and in the centre of single crops and intercrops. Sugar analyses revealed that honeydew was always the main sugar source for parasitoids, and although a significant proportion of parasitoid populations were recorded to feed on nectar, this proportion did not increase in intercrops. Besides, parasitism rates did not increase in intercrops, nor were aphid populations reduced. Thus, our results do not support the nectar provision hypothesis, but rather suggest that although nectar provision benefits parasitoid populations in some systems, its effects on biological control are highly context-dependent. They also confirm that honeydew can be a major food source for parasitoids, which may not necessarily be sugar limited at the field scale.

AB  - Introduction Dopamine system dysfunction is closely associated with nervous system diseases such as Parkinson's disease and psychiatric disorder. Current research is limited to the individual application of dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-related agents, and the systematic effects of combined dopamine D1/D2 receptor inhibition on neural function remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the dose-dependent effects of co-DR1/2I (combined administration of dopamine receptor 1 inhibitor SCH39166 and dopamine receptor 2 inhibitor raclopride) on oxidative stress, learning, memory, emotion, and motor function in the substantia nigra, striatum, and hippocampus of mice.Methods After administering varying doses of co-DR1/2I through gastric tubes to male C57BL/6 mice, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Behavioral changes were assessed, using open field, rotarod, and water maze tests. Tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons were labeled with immunofluorescence, and tyrosine hydroxylase levels were detected by Western blot (WB) assay.Results Low-dose co-DR1/2I significantly increased MAO-B and ROS levels (p < 0.01) and decreased SOD activity (p < 0.01) in the substantia nigra, striatum, and hippocampus. MAO-B activity positively correlated with ROS (r = 0.916, p < 0.001) and negatively correlated with SOD (r = -0.685, p < 0.001), whereas ROS negatively correlated with SOD (r = -0.661, p < 0.001) in co-DR1/2I-treated mice. The medium- and high-dose groups exhibited spatial memory impairment (longer escape latency, p < 0.05) in the water maze and more anxiety-like behavior (reduced central zone time, p < 0.01) in the open field test; however, no abnormalities in motor coordination were observed in the rotarod test (p > 0.05). Immunofluorescence and WB confirmed a reduction in the dopaminergic neuron count after co-DR1/2I.Conclusion This is the first study to demonstrate that co-DR1/2I triggers cognitive and emotional dysfunction by exacerbating oxidative stress and dopaminergic neuronal damage, thereby advancing our understanding of the neurotoxic mechanisms of dopamine receptor antagonists. Future studies are needed to explore targeted antioxidant therapies and receptor-selective modulation strategies to reduce the side effects.

AB  - Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic roles of Tetrandrine (TET) on traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the underlying mechanism. Method Traumatic injury model of hippocampal neurons and TBI mouse model were established to evaluate the therapeutic effects. The expression of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), Caspase 3, and Caspase 12 was detected by immunofluorescence. The expression of TNF-alpha, NF-kappa B, TRAF1, ERS markers (GADD34 and p-PERK), IRE1 alpha, CHOP, JNK, and p-JNK were evaluated by western blot. Flow cytometry was used to determine the apoptosis of neurons. Brain injury was assessed by Garcia score, cerebral water content, and Evan blue extravasation test. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to determine the morphological changes of hippocampal tissue. Apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL staining. Result In traumatic injury model of hippocampal neurons, TET downregulated NSE, TNF-alpha, NF-kappa B, TRAF1, GADD34, p-PERK, IRE1 alpha, CHOP, and p-JNK expression. TET reduced Caspase 3 and Caspase 12 cleavage. Apoptosis rate was inhibited by the introduction of TET. TET improved the Garcia neural score, decreased the cerebral water content and Evans blue extravasation, and reduced NSE, TNF-alpha, NF-kappa B, TRAF1, IRE1 alpha, CHOP, and p-JNK expression in mice with TBI, which was significantly reversed by Anisomycin, a JNK selective activator. Conclusion TET alleviated inflammation and neuron apoptosis in experimental TBI by regulating the IRE1 alpha/JNK/CHOP signal pathway.

AB  - Cisplatin (cis-diclorodiamminoplatin, CDDP) is a common chemotherapeutic agent for solid tumors, but its use is limited by severe side effects such as ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Variability in CDDP dosing and administration, along with high mortality and sensitivity in animal models, complicates experimental approaches. This study aimed to evaluate ototoxic damage in rats by comparing a single bolus versus three divided CDDP injections, also considering nephrotoxic effects. Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: eight received a single intraperitoneal injection of CDDP (14 mg/kg), eight received three injections (4.6 mg/kg/day), and eight were untreated controls. All CDDP-treated rats showed significant high-frequency hearing loss and morphological damage, including cochlear outer hair cell loss and renal glomerular atrophy with proximal tubule necrosis. Oxidative stress markers (nitrotyrosine and SOD1 expression) confirmed cochlear and renal alterations. Notably, the single bolus group had a 25% mortality rate and significant weight loss among survivors, unlike the other groups. This study introduces the novel finding that cumulative administration of three doses reduces mortality and weight loss while maintaining similar ototoxic and nephrotoxic effects. Therefore, cumulative administration is recommended for future studies to mitigate ototoxic and nephrotoxic damage, offering a potentially improved protocol for the administration of cisplatin.

AB  - Simple Summary A wide variety of coronaviruses are enzootic in bats worldwide. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is suspected to have originated in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae spp.) in Asia, though the spillover event is unknown. SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in wild North American bats at the time of this submission, although it has been detected in other native wildlife, such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Further interspecies transmission may establish new viral reservoirs and mutations which may negatively impact wildlife, livestock, and human health. The potential introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into North American bat populations is of interest to wildlife managers due to recent declines of several species, including little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), which have suffered large population collapse due to white-nose syndrome (WNS). We analyzed saliva samples from 235 individual little brown bats from a total of eight maternity colonies throughout the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States. No bat tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR, indicating the virus is either not present or that it persists in undetectable levels in little brown bat populations in this region. The potential introduction of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, into North American bat populations is of interest to wildlife managers due to recent disease-mediated declines of several species. Populations of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) have collapsed due to white-nose syndrome (WNS), a disease caused by the introduction and spread of the fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd). Throughout much of the United States and southern Canada, large colonies of the species routinely established diurnal roosts in anthropogenic structures, thereby creating the potential for direct human contact and cross-species disease transmission. Given recent declines and the potential for further disease impacts, we collected oral swabs from eight little brown bat maternity colonies to assess the presence and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR analysis. Little brown bat colonies in Maryland (n = 1), New Hampshire (n = 1), New Jersey (n = 2), New York (n = 1), Rhode Island (n = 2), and Virginia (n = 1) were taken during May-August, 2022. From 235 assayed individuals, no bat tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Our results indicate that little brown bats may not contract SARS-CoV-2 or that the virus persists at undetectable levels in populations of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast during summer months. Nonetheless, continued monitoring and future work addressing other seasons may still be warranted to conclusively determine infection status.

AB  - Background: Metarhizium is one of the entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) that has been widely reported as a useful agent for controlling the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), Oryctes rhinoceros L. (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae). Application of this fungus as a biopesticide is influenced by regional environmental conditions that affect the pathogenic activity against the targeted pest. Several studies have proven that the native fungal isolates have strong pathogenic activity than EPF introduced from other regions. The identification of local EPF species is a strategic approach to develop potential biopesticides with standard properties including host specificity, climate suitability, and significantly suppressing the target pest population. This study aimed to identify Metarhizium species isolated from infected CRB larvae with high pathogenicity to host pests in East Java, Indonesia. Results: Thirteen isolates were obtained which were divided into 4 clades based on phylogenetic analysis by the ITS rDNA region, namely M. anisopliae var. lepidiotae, M. anisopliae var. anisopliae, M. brunneum, and M. majus. Identified Metarhizium species exhibited varied sizes of conidia, but fell within the size ranges reported in previous studies. Interestingly, the isolate MaSi produced conidial lengths well above the range of conidial sizes recorded and placed these isolates (M. anisopliae) in the MGT clade, known as MALC (M. anisopliae s.l. with large conidia). The present investigation reported that isolates MaLe, MaMa, MaWa, and MaSi produced higher mortality values than other isolates, supporting that M. majus and MALC had higher pathogenicity against O. rhinoceros larvae than other Metarhizium species. Neighbor-joining analysis showed a close resemblance between the isolate MaMa and the strain ARSEF 1946, which was isolated from the CRB. In addition, the isolate MaMa had the highest virulence against O. rhinoceros larval cadaver with a faster lethal time (for 50% mortality). This result indicated a possible relationship between phylogenetic status or DNA sequence polymorphisms with Metarhizium pathogenicity and host specificity. Conclusions: The local species of Metarhizium have been isolated from infected CRB larvae, and M. majus isolates exhibited high pathogenicity against O. rhinoceros larvae. The close similarity of M. majus isolates and CRB-isolated strains suggests a possible relationship between pathogenicity and host specificity with phylogenetic status or DNA sequence polymorphisms.

AB  - IntroductionTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability in the US. Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang-1-7), an endogenous peptide, acts at the G protein coupled MAS1 receptors (MASR) to inhibit inflammatory mediators and decrease reactive oxygen species within the CNS. Few studies have identified whether Ang-(1-7) decreases cognitive impairment following closed TBI. This study examined the therapeutic effect of Ang-(1-7) on secondary injury observed in a murine model of mild TBI (mTBI) in a closed skull, single injury model. Materials and methodsMale mice (n = 108) underwent a closed skull, controlled cortical impact injury. Two hours after injury, mice were administered either Ang-(1-7) (n = 12) or vehicle (n = 12), continuing through day 5 post-TBI, and tested for cognitive impairment on days 1-5 and 18. pTau, Tau, GFAP, and serum cytokines were measured at multiple time points. Animals were observed daily for cognition and motor coordination via novel object recognition. Brain sections were stained and evaluated for neuronal injury. ResultsAdministration of Ang-(1-7) daily for 5 days post-mTBI significantly increased cognitive function as compared to saline control-treated animals. Cortical and hippocampal structures showed less damage in the presence of Ang-(1-7), while Ang-(1-7) administration significantly changed the expression of pTau and GFAP in cortical and hippocampal regions as compared to control. DiscussionThese are among the first studies to demonstrate that sustained administration of Ang-(1-7) following a closed-skull, single impact mTBI significantly improves neurologic outcomes, potentially offering a novel therapeutic modality for the prevention of long-term CNS impairment following such injuries.

KW  - Virtual elephant fence
KW  - Multiple stimuli
KW  - Human-elephant conflict
AB  - Against the backdrop of the almost total failure of conventional physical fences to prevent deaths due to human-elephant conflict and elephant-train collision, management of the problem requires novel approaches. The elephant is a giant and intelligent animal, who, as has been observed through experience, cannot be effectively confined to an area by physical barriers, most of which are built without even considering long-established elephant passes. Instead, human habitats and facilities, including highways, should be pre-planned following an overall strategy to suitably assign natural resources to each party such that natural habitats are disturbed as little as possible. Hence, we envisage the need for a virtual elephant fence as part of the aforesaid strategy to warn elephants that a certain area is not appropriate for them to be present in or best for the safety of the herd. The present study involved in-depth experimentation to investigate the effects of multiple stimuli on real elephants based on the known elephant responses to such stimuli. The proposed system is an autonomous system that detects the presence of elephants, generates alarms for concerned parties, and coordinatively and tactically repels the animals back to safer areas. Experiment results indicated that the sound of a drone and the sound of tiger growls can both exert a strong deterrent effect on elephants. The sound of bees and the low-frequency burst yielded similar results in terms of encounter and withdrawal reactions. The resulting insights may lay a foundation for a novel approach toward the management of human-elephant conflict and elephant-train collisions.

AB  - Efficient and accurate large-scale networks are a fundamental tool in modeling brain areas, to advance our understanding of neuronal dynamics. However, their implementation faces two key issues: computational efficiency and heterogeneity. Computational efficiency is achieved using simplified neurons, whereas there are no practical solutions available to solve the problem of reproducing in a large-scale network the experimentally observed heterogeneity of the intrinsic properties of neurons. This is important, because the use of identical nodes in a network can generate artifacts which can hinder an adequate representation of the properties of a real network. To this aim, we introduce a mathematical procedure to generate an arbitrary large number of copies of simplified hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and interneurons models, which exhibit the full range of firing dynamics observed in these cells - including adapting, non -adapting and bursting. For this purpose, we rely on a recently published adaptive generalized leaky integrate -and -fire (A-GLIF) modeling approach, leveraging on its ability to reproduce the rich set of electrophysiological behaviors of these types of neurons under a variety of different stimulation currents. The generation procedure is based on a perturbation of model's parameters related to the initial data, firing block, and internal dynamics, and suitably validated against experimental data to ensure that the firing dynamics of any given cell copy remains within the experimental range. A classification procedure confirmed that the firing behavior of most of the pyramidal/interneuron copies was consistent with the experimental data. This approach allows to obtain heterogeneous copies with mathematically controlled firing properties. A full set of heterogeneous neurons composing the CA1 region of a rat hippocampus (approximately 1.2 million neurons), are provided in a database freely available in the live paper section of the EBRAINS platform. By adapting the underlying A-GLIF framework, it will be possible to extend the numerical approach presented here to create, in a mathematically controlled manner, an arbitrarily large number of non -identical copies of cell populations with firing properties related to other brain areas.

AB  - Introduction: Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a psycho-socio-biological disease characterized by severe weight loss as result of dieting and hyperactivity. Effective treatments are scarce, despite its significant prevalence and mortality. AN patients show lower basal insulin levels and increased metabolic clearance, leading to weight loss, cognitive deficits, and hormonal imbalances. Low-dose polymer insulin could potentially reverse these effects by restoring brain function, reducing fear of weight gain, encouraging food intake, and restoring fat depots. This study evaluates an insulin delivery system designed for sustained release and AN treatment. Methods: AN-like model was established through dietary restriction (DR). On days 1-25, mice were on DR, and on days 26-31 they were on ad libitum regimen. An insulin-loaded delivery system was administered subcutaneously (1% w/w insulin). The impact of insulin treatment on gene expression in the hippocampus (cognition, regulation of stress, neurogenesis) and hypothalamus (eating behavior, mood) was assessed. Behavioral assays were conducted to evaluate motor activity and cognitive function. Results: The delivery system demonstrated sustained insulin release, maintaining therapeutic plasma levels. Diet restriction mice treated with the insulin delivery system showed body weight restoration. Gene expression analysis revealed enhanced expression of CB1 and CB2 genes associated with improved eating behavior and cognition, while POMC expression was reduced. Insulin-polymer treatment restored cognitive function and decreased hyperactivity in the AN-like model. Conclusion: The PSA-RA-based insulin delivery system effectively restores metabolic balance, body weight, and cognitive function in the AN model. Its ability to steadily release insulin makes it a promising candidate for AN treatment."

AB  - Bearded Vultures deliberately stain their feathers with iron oxides from ferruginous springs (FS) to acquire orange colouration. This uncommon behaviour is believed to play an important role in the relationship between individuals, so FS may constitute a strategic resource for the species. In the French Central-Western Pyrenees, we surveyed and mapped FS, checked those used by Bearded Vultures and characterised their habitat variables and geological features. We also evaluated FS availability in Bearded Vultures' home ranges and their conservation status. FS occurred in relatively large number (more than three hundred) in the study area, spatially distributed in a very heterogeneous way. Sedimentary or metamorphic rocks dating from the Palaeozoic Era (-541 to -252 million years ago) hold majority of them, with schists being the predominant rock type (62.1%). FS were near absent from limestone massifs of the North-Pyrenean zone and from granite formations of the axial zone. We found evidences of use by Bearded Vultures in a limited number of sites (n = 27 out of 339 localised FS). These colouring sites were characterised by steep slopes, intense coloured iron oxide deposits and a location usually close to the forest edge. Availability of colouring sites for breeding Bearded Vultures (n = 32 pairs or trios in the study area) was high enough: we localised a mean of 36.9 available FS and 2.6 used FS in a 15 km-radius around the usual breeding site of each pair/trio. The mean distance between a breeding site and the nearest known colouring site was 8.8 +/- 0.86 km, a minor flight distance for this species. The conservation status of the used FS seems generally satisfactory, although one site disappeared due to drought and three others were damaged by domestic livestock trampling or wild ungulates. The vicinity of cables or fences, i.e. potential mortality factors, also concerns three of the used FS. We recommend to consider these colouring sites as key resources for the species and to protect them from any damage.

AB  - IntroductionThe extracellular deposition of beta-amyloid (A beta) is a pathological hallmark in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which induces microglial activation in the pathology of AD. The expression of serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (SRPK2) is increased in the brain tissues of patients with AD. In this study, we examined the effect of SRPK2 in the activation of microglia. MethodsMicroglia (BV2) cells were cultured and the expression of SRPK2 was enhanced by transfection of SRPK2 recombinant vectors or knockdown by SRPK2 small interfering RNA (siRNA). The cells were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or A beta in vitro, generating inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-10, and IL-6], which were investigated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and ELISA. The proliferation ability of the BV2 cells with/without SRPK2 expression was evaluated by WST-1 under pressure in the presence of A beta. The effects of SRPK2 on microglia polarization were evaluated by investigating the expression of CD16/32 and CD206 by western blot and the expression of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (IBA-1) and arginase-1 (Arg-1) by immunofluorescence. Hippocampal cells HT-22 were cultured with a BV2 cell (with/without SRPK2 expression)-derived medium stimulated by A beta or LPS + IFN-gamma, prior to the evaluation of HT-22 cytotoxicity by assessment of cell viability. Possible relationships between Akt and SRPK2 in the BV2 cells were investigated by western blot. ResultsThe expression of SRPK2 was related to the phenotype polarization changes of microglia with increased expression of CD16/32 and IBA-1. The expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha was increased, whereas the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was decreased in the BV2 cells with SRPK2 overexpression. Moreover, with the expression enhancement of SRPK2, the BV2 cells had a higher proliferation rate. A beta treatment can promote SRPK2 expression in BV2 cells. A beta or LPS + IFN-gamma promoted the production of cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha but decreased cytokine IL-10 in the BV2 cells. SRPK2 deficiency alleviated the cytotoxic effects of A beta or LPS + IFN-gamma exposed microglia on HT22 cells. In addition, the activated Akt pathway promoted the expression of SRPK2 in the BV2 cells. ConclusionOur data have found that enhanced SRPK2 expression contributed to the proinflammatory activation of microglia. Thus, SRPK2 may be a key modulating pathway of inflammatory mediators in AD pathology.

AB  - Introduction: Children with wheeze and asthma present with airway epithelial vulnerabilities, such as impaired responses to viral infection. It is postulated that the in utero environment may contribute to the development of airway epithelial vulnerabilities. The aims of the study were to establish whether the receptors for rhinovirus (RV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are expressed in the amniotic membrane and whether the pattern of expression is similar to newborn nasal epithelium. Methods: Placenta were collected (n = 33) from newborns in AERIAL, a sub-study nested under the ORIGINS birth cohort. Using purified RNA from amniotic samples (n = 33), along with previously extracted RNA from nasal epithelial cells from newborns (n = 20), real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to determine gene expression of viral receptors for RV, RSV and SARS-CoV-2 in both amniotic and newborn nasal epithelial samples. In addition, receptor protein expression was quantified through Western blot and localised using immunohistochemical staining in amniotic samples. Results: Amniotic and newborn nasal samples expressed various receptors for RV (ICAM-1, LDLR, CDHR3), RSV (NCL, CX3CR1) and SARS-CoV-2 (ACE2, TMPRSS2) at the gene level, although the magnitude of expression varied. In addition, protein expression of these receptors was confirmed in the amniotic samples. These proteins were localised to the epithelial layer of the amniotic membrane. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study indicates the potential of amniotic samples to facilitate investigation into the interactions between the in utero environment and prenatal programming of epithelial innate immune responses to viruses.

AB  - Simple Summary Local communities living on the edge of protected areas often experience negative impacts on their livelihoods due to wildlife. These situations threaten support for long-term conservation of wildlife and wild habitats so a key for conservation sustainability should be based on implementing socially accepted and economically sustainable mitigation practices. For successful design and implementation of mitigation strategies, it is vital to engage local communities and understand their preferences and previous experiences. In this study, we present a choice experiment as a tool to analyze local farmer preferences for the most common farm-based solutions to reduce African elephant crop damage. Results show that there are significant differences among responses triggered by farmers' previous experience with elephants and socioeconomic situation, with a marked spatial distribution among respondents. This methodology, based on a choice modeling approach considering the differential availability of resources and previous experience with elephants or other wildlife, is highly applicable, with small changes in other areas where wildlife competes with local communities for resources. This approach also represents a suitable instrument for identifying stakeholders' preferences in each specific context. Local communities surrounding wildlife corridors and natural reserves often face challenges related to human-wildlife coexistence. To mitigate the challenges and ensure the long-term conservation of wildlife, it is important to engage local communities in the design of conservation strategies. By conducting 480 face-to-face interviews in 30 villages along and adjacent to the Selous-Niassa Wildlife Corridor (Tanzania), we quantified farmers' preferences for farm-based measures to mitigate African elephant damage using choice experiments. Results show that farmers considered no action the least preferred option, revealing that they are open to trying different measures. The most preferred management strategy matched with the preferences of wildlife rangers in the area, suggesting low concern about the potential conflicts between stakeholders. However, a latent class model suggests that there are significant differences among responses triggered by farmers' previous experience with elephants, the intensity of the elephant damage, and the socioeconomic situation of the farmer. Results show a marked spatial distribution among respondents, highlighting the benefits of zone management as conflicts were found to be highly context dependent. Understanding the human dimension of conservation is essential for the successful planification and implementation of conservation strategies. Therefore, the development and broad utilization of methodologies to gather specific context information should be encouraged.

AB  - Introduction: Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) is a protein involved in many neuronal processes in the nervous system including the modulation of synaptic transmission. The loss of FMRP produces the fragile X syndrome (FXS), a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting synaptic and neuronal function and producing cognitive impairments. However, the effects of FXS on short-term processing of synaptic inputs and neuronal outputs in the hippocampus have not yet been sufficiently clarified. Furthermore, it is not known whether dorsal and ventral hippocampi are affected similarly or not in FXS. Method: We used an Fmr1 knockout (KO) rat model of FXS and recordings of evoked field potentials from the CA1 field of transverse slices from both the dorsal and the ventral hippocampi of adult rats. Results: Following application of a frequency stimulation protocol consisting of a ten-pulse train and recordings of fEPSP, we found that the dorsal but not ventral KO hippocampus shows altered short-term synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, applying the frequency stimulation protocol and recordings of population spikes, both segments of the KO hippocampus display altered short-term neuronal dynamics. Conclusions: These data suggest that short-term processing of synaptic inputs is affected in the dorsal, not ventral, FXS hippocampus, while short-term processing of neuronal output is affected in both segments of the FXS hippocampus in a similar way. These FXS-associated changes may have significant impact on the functions of the dorsal and ventral hippocampi in individuals with FXS.

AB  - IntroductionHydatidosis is a zoonotic neglected disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus. Evidence suggests a communication between hydatid cyst (HC) and hosts via extracellular vesicles (EVs). However, a little is known about the communication between EVs derived from HC fluid (HCF) and host cells. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of HCF derived EVs on expression of fibrotic and anti-fibrotic miRNAs in THP-1 cell line.MethodsIn the current study, EVs were isolated using ultracentrifugation from wild-infected sheep HCF and characterized by western blot, electron microscope, and size distribution analysis. The effects of EVs on the expression levels of microRNAs (mir-16, mir-29a, and mir-155) involved in liver fibrosis were investigated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), 3 and 24 h after incubation.ResultsWestern blot analyses confirmed the expression of CD63 marker, while Calnexin and CD81 were absent in EVs samples. The SEM and morphology revealed round shape vesicles. The DLS analysis showed average size distribution 130.6 nm diameter. The expression levels of mir-16 and mir-29a were significantly upregulated after 3 h for 8.66 and 3.420, respectively, while they were significantly downregulated after 24 h for 3.853 and 1.859, respectively.ConclusionThe main mechanism of the communication between EVs derived from HCF and their host remains unclear. Our results suggest that HC may modulate the expression of miRNAs, involved in liver fibrosis via EVs.

AB  - Cities in which the synurbization of some important predators began simultaneously with, or earlier than, the synurbization of prey species are a precious tool for studying the specificity of predator-prey interactions in urban landscapes. The city of Moscow is an excellent example. The following bird species can be considered synurbic in the city: Tadorna ferruginea (introduced), Bucephala clangula (a successfully introduced species, but the breeding population has declined dramatically since 2010), Anas platyrhynchos (reintroduced), Accipiter gentilis, Falco subbuteo, F. tinnunculus, Corvus cornix, Turdus pilaris, Parus major, and Cyanistes caeruleus. Accipiter nisus, Gallinula chloropus, Asio otus, Motacilla alba, Lanius collurio, Sturnus vulgaris, Hippolais icterina, Sylvia atricapilla, Muscicapa striata, Erithacus rubecula, Luscinia luscinia, Turdus philomelos, T. merula, Fringilla coelebs, Carduelis chloris, and C. carduelis are also successful inhabitants of the city, although their maximum breeding densities in urban green spaces are not obviously higher than those in rural/natural landscapes. A huge and dense population of Corvus cornix, an important nest predator, was formed in Moscow during the 1960s and early 1970s. The urban population of Accipiter gentilis varying during the last decades around 35-40 pairs yearly developed between the late 1970s and early 1990s. Currently, some areas within the city support comparatively diverse predator assemblages. For example, the 1.7-km(2) initial area of the Lomonosov Moscow State University at Vorob'evy Gory contains at least 18 predatory species of mammals and birds in the breeding season, including Falco peregrinus, F. subbuteo, F. tinnunculus, Accipiter nisus, Asio otus, Garrulus glandarius, etc. At the same time, some important predators, like most mustelids, are lacking or rare in Moscow. The order and approximate timing of the establishment of urban populations of different species indicate that a number of avian prey species have reached or been able to maintain high breeding densities in urban green spaces simultaneously with and/or after the synurbization of important predators. In several prey species studied at some localities of the city over the last decades, the proportion of depredated nests was, on average, relatively moderate for a given species (in Turdus philomelos) or sufficiently low (in Parus major, Cyanistes caeruleus, and Turdus pilaris). In general, these conclusions are supported by published data on the same or other prey species from some other cities located in the European part of Russia (Kaliningrad, Ryazan, Voronezh). Even in the presence of numerous predators, urban environments are more or less successfully occupied by substantial numbers of avian prey species from distant taxa and different ecological groups. These include many open-nesters whose clutches and nestlings are highly vulnerable to such predators as corvids and owls. To conclude, a negative answer, although with some reservations, must be given to the question: are predators a difficult barrier for the synurbization of avian prey species?

AB  - The habit of drinking tea is highly prevalent and could be utilized to introduce more health benefits through fortification with medicinal plants. The purpose of this analysis was to assess the nutritional quality and health benefits of fortified Ziziphus tea (ZT) with green tea (GT) against obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Proximate analysis and sensory evaluation were carried out on the fortified tea. In the in vivo study, 15 SD rats were used for each group. Flow cytometry was utilized for caspase 3 analysis. ELISA was used for the detection of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and adiponectin levels. Real-time PCR was used to detect Notch-1 and Hes-1 gene expression. The composition of fortified (GT+ZT) showed a significant improvement in the nutritional value represented by the increase in overall protein, crude fat, crude fiber, ash, carbohydrate, mineral contents, and antioxidant capacity. Treatment with GT+ZT restored the disturbance in body weight, lipid profile, liver function, glucose, insulin sensitivity index, and oxidative status. It reversed the changes in TNF-alpha and adiponectin levels. Their protective effects against NAFLD were indicated by the inhibition of hepatic caspase-3 activity, suppression of Notch-1, and Hes-1 gene expression and amelioration of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced histological alterations. Collectively, our findings, elucidate the precise mechanism of fortified ZT+GT for the attenuation of obesity-induced metabolic disorders and NAFLD via regulating lipolysis, TNF-alpha, adiponectin, apoptosis, and Notch-1 signaling pathways, and provide a foundation for an easily implemented healthy habit of drinking. Practical applications The incorporation of bioactive compounds into functional foods is a growing market. Consumer attention in well-being has increased rapidly toward a fortified diet that provides additional health effects. The fortified (GT+ZT) tea may potentially serve as an easily implemented healthy drinking habit to prevent and manage obesity and NAFLD and reduce the risk of other diseases. Fortification with ZT improved the health-promoting functionality of GT through the enhancement of total protein, carbohydrates, antioxidant, and mineral contents. This was reflected by their synergetic therapeutic activity in ameliorating the disturbance in obesity-related disorders and NAFLD via regulating lipolysis, inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and Notch-1 signaling pathways. Therefore, (GT+ZT) could be considered functional foods which attribute to functional improvement and reduction in disease risk.

AB  - Introduction Herbivorous insects, including the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens, are among the most damaging pests to agricultural crops worldwide, particularly rice. These insects employ a variety of strategies to overcome plant defenses, including the secretion of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) that degrade plant cell walls. While CAZymes are well-studied in other insect species, their role in BPH virulence remains largely unexplored.Methods This study aims to address this gap by analyzing CAZymes in 182 insect genomes, followed by a detailed genomic and transcriptomic analysis of BPH.Results We identified 644 CAZymes in BPH, including enzymes related to plant cell wall degradation. Through quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and subcellular localization experiments, we found that 5 candidate genes exhibited increased expression during feeding on the susceptible rice variety TN1, a well-characterized variety highly susceptible to BPH and these genes were localized to the plasma membrane. Our results suggest that BPH CAZymes play a critical role in the insect's ability to feed and damage rice plants.Discussion This study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying insect adaptation and virulence in the co-evolutionary process between plants and herbivorous insects. By exploring the function of pest-related genes in the BPH and examining their differential responses in rice varieties with varying resistance to BPH, we aim to contribute to the development of targeted pest management strategies.

AB  - Introduction: Broussonetia papyrifera is a dioecious plant that is rich in various metabolites and widely distribute in Asia. Microtus fortis is a rodent that often causes damage to crops, especially in the Dongting Lake region of China. There is a wide overlap in the distribution areas for the above species and the M. fortis feeds on the leaves of the B. papyrifera. Preliminary experiments have shown that the reproduction of M. fortis is inhibited after feeding on the leaves of the B. papyrifera. Methods: In order to explore the potential of using B. papyrifera to develop botanical pesticides, we investigated the palatability and reactive substances. The feeding frequency of M. fortis on B. papyrifera leaves to that of on daily fodder and Carex brevicuspis that is the primary food for the wild population were compared. We also attempted to identify the responsive substances in B. papyrifera leaves that were bitten by M. fortis using metabolome analysis. Results: In general, B. papyrifera leaves exhibited a stronger attraction to M. fortis. M. fortis foraged B. papyrifera leaves more frequently, and the intake was higher than that of the other two. Differential metabolites were screened by comparing normal leaves and leaves bitten by M. fortis, meanwhile with the intervention of clipped leaves. A total of 269 substances were screened, and many of these were involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including terpenoids and alkaloids. These substances may be related to the defense mechanism of B. papyrifera against herbivores. Discussion: These findings support further research examining animal-plant interactions and simultaneously provide insights into the utilisation of B. papyrifera resources and the management of rodents. The good palatability and the defense of B. papyrifera leaves suggest that they have the potential to contribute in development of plant rodenticide.

AB  - Plants synthesize an array of volatile compounds, many of which serve ecological roles in attracting pollinators, deterring herbivores, and communicating with their surroundings. Methyl anthranilate (MeAA) is an anti-herbivory defensive volatile responsible for grape aroma that is emitted by several agriculturally relevant plants, including citrus, grapes, and maize. Unlike maize, which uses a one-step anthranilate methyltransferase (AAMT), grapes have been thought to use a two-step pathway for MeAA biosynthesis. By mining available transcriptomics data, we identified two AAMTs in Vitis vinifera (wine grape), as well as one ortholog in "Concord" grape. Many angiosperms methylate the plant hormone salicylic acid (SA) to produce methyl salicylate, which acts as a plant-to-plant communication molecule. Because the Citrus sinensis (sweet orange) SA methyltransferase can methylate both anthranilate (AA) and SA, we used this enzyme to examine the molecular basis of AA activity by introducing rational mutations, which identified several active site residues that increase activity with AA. Reversing this approach, we introduced mutations that imparted activity with SA in the maize AAMT, which uncovered different active site residues from those in the citrus enzyme. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that one of the Vitis AAMTs shares an ancestor with jasmonic acid methyltransferases, similar to the AAMT from strawberry (Frageria sp.). Collectively, these data demonstrate the molecular mechanisms underpinning AA activity across methyltransferases and identify one-step enzymes by which grapes synthesize MeAA.

AB  - Introduction Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a widely used solvent to dissolve hydrophobic substances for clinical uses and experimental in vivo purposes. While usually regarded safe, our prior studies suggest changes to behavior following DMSO exposure. We therefore evaluated the effects of a five-day, short-term exposure to DMSO on postnatal infant rats (P6-10).
   Methods DMSO was intraperitoneally injected for five days at 0.2, 2.0, and 4.0 ml/kg body mass. One cohort of animals was sacrificed 24 hr after DMSO exposure to analyze the neurometabolic changes in four brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum) by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. A second cohort of animals was used to analyze chronic alterations to behavior and pathological changes to glia and neuronal cells later in life (P21-P40).
   Results 164 metabolites, including key regulatory molecules (retinoic acid, orotic acid, adrenic acid, and hypotaurine), were found significantly altered by DMSO exposure in at least one of the brain regions at P11 (p < .05). Behavioral tests showed significant hypoactive behavior and decreased social habits to the 2.0 and 4.0 ml DMSO/kg groups (p < .01). Significant increases in number of microglia and astrocytes at P40 were observed in the 4.0 ml DMSO/kg group (at p < .015.)
   Conclusions Despite short-term exposure at low, putatively nontoxic concentrations, DMSO led to changes in behavior and social preferences, chronic alterations in glial cells, and changes in essential regulatory brain metabolites. The chronic neurological effects of DMSO exposure reported here raise concerns about its neurotoxicity and consequent safety in human medical applications and clinical trials.

AB  - IntroductionGut microbiota dysbiosis is a key factor of the pathogenesis of post-stroke depression (PSD). PSD is associated with increased hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and decreased synaptic connectivity. Inulin can be involved in hippocampal neuron protection through the microbiome-gut-brain axis. However, the neuroprotective effects of inulin in PSD are still to be further investigated.MethodsBy utilizing the GEO public database, we identify differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus following inulin intake. This can help us discover key signaling pathways through functional enrichment analysis. Furthermore, we validate the expression levels of signaling molecules in a rat model of PSD and examine the effects of inulin on behavioral changes and body weight. Additionally, conducting a microbiome analysis to identify significantly different microbial populations and perform correlation analysis.ResultsThe intake of inulin significantly up-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in the hippocampus. Inulin changed in the gut microbiota structure, leading to an increase in the abundance of Lactobacillus and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 in the intestines of PSD rats, while decreasing the abundance of Ruminococcus UCG_005, Prevotella_9, Oscillospiraceae, and Clostridia UCG_014. Furthermore, the inulin diet elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 in the serum, which showed a positive correlation with the abundance of Lactobacillus. Notably, the consumption of inulin-enriched diet increased activity levels and preference for sugar water in PSD rats, while also reducing body weight.ConclusionThese findings highlight the potential therapeutic benefits of inulin in the management of depression and emphasize the importance of maintaining a healthy gut microbiota for PSD.

AB  - Nacre is a biomaterial that has shown osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties in vitro and in vivo. These properties make nacre a material of interest for inducing bone regeneration. However, information is very limited regarding the introduction of nacre to dental implant surgery for promoting osteogenesis. This study investigated the potential of nacre powder for peri-implant bone regeneration in a porcine model. Ninety-six dental implants were placed into the tibia of twelve male domestic pigs. The dental implants were coated with nacre powder from the giant oyster before implantation. Implantations without nacre powder were used as control groups. Euthanization took place at 2, 4 and 6 weeks after implantation, after which we measured bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone volume density (BVD) of the implanted bone samples using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), and examined the histology of the surrounding bone using histological sections stained with Stevenel's blue and Alizarin red S. The micro-CT analyses showed that the BIC of dental implantations with nacre powder were significantly higher than those without nacre powder, by 7.60%. BVD of implantations with nacre powder were significantly higher than those without nacre powder, by 12.48% to 13.66% in cortical bone, and by 3.37% to 6.11% in spongy bone. Histological study revealed more peri-implant bone regeneration toward the surface of the dental implants after implantation with nacre powder. This was consistent with the micro-CT results. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using nacre to promote peri-implant bone regeneration in dental implantation.

AB  - Utilization of marine photovoltaic energy is primarily focused on surface harvesting with limited photovoltaic cell implementations in submarine environments. Potential applications include marine wildlife telemetry devices, autonomous underwater vehicles, or remote sensing assets. In these applications, understanding the power at depth is critical, but there has yet to be a long-term study of cell performance in a realistic marine environment that spans time, geographic location, and depth. In this paper, we present photovoltaic assessments carried out by devices mounted to adult female northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) during their spring migrations in the Pacific Ocean with deployment times between 76 and 107 days. Encompassing a large geographic area between Santa Cruz, California, and the Aleutian Islands of Alaska during their migrations, elephant seal behavior allows for repeated depth profiles each day, making them an ideal host for subsurface power assessments. This paper presents the first longitudinal study of photovoltaic cell performance in the marine environment that spans location, time, and depth. This work discusses the calibration, data time alignment, and power calculations of these oceanic deployments. Deployment results, including power results and energy predictions from the data record, are presented up to 22 m in depth. We highlight how the recorded power data of these cells compares to previously published results and how depth impacts subsurface power and energy harvesting.
   Custom photovoltaic assessment modules (CPAMs) were designed to measure photovoltaic performance via current-voltage measurements at depth. They were attached to adult female northern elephant seals prior to migrations in the Pacific Ocean. The results of this deployment, including power and energy averages, are presented up to 22 meters in depth.image

AB  - Introduction: Red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) infestation (SMI) is a detrimental factor for roses grown indoors. Although predatory mite (Neoseiulus californicus) antagonism (PMA) is often utilized to alleviate SMI damage, little is known about the defensive response of greenhouse-grown roses to SMI and the molecular mechanism by which PMA protects roses. Methods: To determine the transcriptome and metabolome responses of roses to SMI and PMA, the leaves of a rose cultivar ("Fairy Zixia/Nightingale") were infested with T. urticae, followed by the introduction of predator mite. Leaf samples were collected at various time points and subjected to transcriptome and metabolome analyses. Results: We found that 24 h of SMI exerted the most changes in the expression of defense-related genes and metabolites in rose leaves. KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and metabolites revealed that rose responses to SMI and PMA were primarily enriched in pathways such as sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis, benzoxazinoid biosynthesis, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, phytosterol biosynthesis, MAPK signaling pathway, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and other pathways associated with resistance to biotic stress. Rose reacted to SMI and PMA by increasing the expression of structural genes and metabolite levels in phytosterol biosynthesis, mevalonate (MVA) pathway, benzoxazinoid biosynthesis, and stilbenoid biosynthesis. In addition, PMA caused a progressive recover from SMI, allowing rose to revert to its normal growth state. PMA restored the expression of 190 essential genes damaged by SMI in rose leaves, including transcription factors DRE1C, BH035, MYB14, EF110, WRKY24, NAC71, and MY108. However, after 144 h of PMA treatment, rose responsiveness to stimulation was diminished, and after 192 h, the metabolic levels of organic acids and lipids were recovered in large measure. Conclusion: In conclusion, our results offered insights on how roses coordinate their transcriptome and metabolome to react to SMI and PMA, therefore shedding light on how roses, T. urticae, and N. californicus interact.

AB  - Introduction: As a result of the rapid increase in population and depletion of natural resources, particularly energy and water, approximately 200 million people are expected to face hunger by 2030. Going forward, the sustainability of energy, water, and food (EWF) resources can be enhanced by considering a nexus approach, which supports effective resource management by identifying synergies and trade-offs. Furthermore, the regeneration of biomass into value-added products, such as biochar (BC), can reduce cross-sectoral environmental impacts and support the EWF nexus.Methodology: This research investigates the optimum options for utilizing BC within the context of the EWF nexus for both wastewater treatment and soil applications whilst considering the optimal blending ratio of various biomass (camel manure, date pits, sewage sludge, and coffee waste) for both single-end use and multi-end use stages to fulfill various objectives within defined scenarios based on maximum savings in energy, water, cost, and emissions.Results and discussion: The single-end use stage considered using BC for wastewater treatment (WWT) and as a soil amendment (SA) individually, and 18 optimal solutions were collected for this stage. The optimization of the multi-end use stage resulted in 70 optimal solutions, where BC was applied for both WWT and SA. The solutions that leaned toward SA application suggested that BC should consist of 97%-99% of date pits with relatively smaller proportions of the other biomass. On the other hand, the other solutions that leaned toward the WWT pathway suggested that the optimum biomass mix should consist of relatively equal proportions of camel manure, sewage sludge, and coffee waste of 29%-33% and smaller amounts of date pits of approximately 2%-5%.

AB  - The digenetic trematode family Gorgocephalidae comprises just a few species, and the literature devoted to the lineage consists of only a handful of reports. With one exception, all reports have been based on material collected in the Indo-West Pacific, an expansive marine ecoregion stretching from the east coast of Africa to Easter Island, Hawaii and French Polynesia. We collected adult and intramolluscan gorgocephalids from kyphosid fishes and littorinid gastropods from several Australian localities, and from South Africa and French Polynesia. Specimens of Gorgocephalus kyphosi and G. yaaji were collected from, or near, their type-localities, providing new morphological and molecular (COI, ITS2 and 28S) data needed for a revised understanding of species boundaries in the family. Two new species are recognized: Gorgocephalus euryaleae sp. nov. and Gorgocephalus graboides sp. nov. New definitive host records are provided for described species and three new intermediate hosts are identified. These new records are all associated with Kyphosus fishes and littorinid gastropods, reaffirming the restriction of gorgocephalids to these hosts. Most significantly, we provide evidence that G. yaaji is distributed from South Africa to French Polynesia, spanning the breadth of the Indo-West Pacific. Our findings have significant relevance regarding digenean species delineation over geographic range.

AB  - Information on sow nursing behavior plays an important role in improving the survival rate of weaned piglets. To obtain more information on sow nursing processing, it is necessary to introduce beginning-and end-stage nursing behavior recognition. This is defined as fine-grained nursing behavior recognition. In this paper, we attempt to automate fine-grained nursing behavior recognition with surveillance video. First, nursing behavior is divided into three subbehaviors: before piglet sucking, piglet sucking and end piglet sucking. Then, a deep neural network model with a dual-stream structure, named SlowFast, is introduced to realize preliminary sow nursing behavior recognition by extracting spatiotemporal features. Finally, for some erroneous results in behavior recognition and the recognition ambiguity in behavior transition, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is introduced to modify the behavioral label sequence by using the Viterbi algorithm. To verify the effectiveness of our method, all experiments are carried out on sow nursing videos collected in an actual breeding environment. The results show that our method achieves a 90.50% sequence coincidence degree for the recognition results on long videos containing the whole nursing behavior, and the accuracy of behavior transition times reaches 87.05%. In summary, this study refines the automatic sow nursing behavior monitoring content to provide more information for precision livestock farming.

AB  - Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline due to accumulating synaptic insults by toxic oligomers of amyloid beta (A beta O) and tau (TauO). There is growing consensus that preventing these oligomers from interacting with synapses might be an effective approach to treat AD. However, recent clinical trial failures suggest low effectiveness of targeting A beta in late-stage AD. Researchers have redirected their attention toward TauO as the levels of this species increase later in disease pathogenesis. Here we show that A beta O and TauO differentially target synapses and affect each other's binding dynamics. Methods Binding of labeled, pre-formed A beta and tau oligomers onto synaptosomes isolated from the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mouse and postmortem cognitively intact elderly human brains was evaluated using flow-cytometry and western blot analyses. Binding of labeled, pre-formed A beta and tau oligomers onto mouse primary neurons was assessed using immunofluorescence assay. The synaptic dysfunction was measured by fluorescence analysis of single-synapse long-term potentiation (FASS-LTP) assay. Results We demonstrated that higher TauO concentrations effectively outcompete A beta O and become the prevailing synaptic-associated species. Conversely, high concentrations of A beta O facilitate synaptic TauO recruitment. Immunofluorescence analyses of mouse primary cortical neurons confirmed differential synaptic binding dynamics of A beta O and TauO. Moreover, in vivo experiments using old 3xTgAD mice ICV injected with either A beta O or TauO fully supported these findings. Consistent with these observations, FASS-LTP analyses demonstrated that TauO-induced suppression of chemical LTP was exacerbated by A beta O. Finally, predigestion with proteinase K abolished the ability of TauO to compete off A beta O without affecting the ability of high A beta O levels to increase synaptic TauO recruitment. Thus, unlike A beta O, TauO effects on synaptosomes are hampered by the absence of protein substrate in the membrane. Conclusions These results introduce the concept that TauO become the main synaptotoxic species at late AD, thus supporting the hypothesis that TauO may be the most effective therapeutic target for clinically manifest AD.

AB  - Introduction Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a hereditary neurodevelopmental condition influenced by genetic alterations, particularly in genes regulating neural development and synaptic plasticity. Emerging evidence suggests that the Mex3c gene plays a role in energy metabolism and neuronal development, indicating its potential relevance to ASD pathogenesis.Methods To investigate the role of Mex3c in ASD, we generated Mex3c knockout (KO) mice and conducted a series of behavioral tests, histological analyses, and molecular assays. Behavioral phenotyping included elevated plus maze, open-field test, and three-chamber social interaction test. Histological assessments included Nissl staining, Golgi-Cox staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Molecular evaluations included Western blotting and analysis of the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC1 alpha signaling pathway.Results Mex3c KO mice exhibited autistic-like behaviors, including social deficits and anxiety-like traits. These behavioral abnormalities were accompanied by reduced neuronal number, decreased dendritic spine density, and impaired synaptic protein expression in the hippocampus. Mitochondrial structural damage and dysfunction were observed, alongside suppression of the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC1 alpha signaling pathway.Conclusion Our findings suggest that Mex3c gene deletion induces ASD-like phenotypes in mice, potentially through disruption of mitochondrial function and synaptic integrity via the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC1? pathway. These results support the candidacy of Mex3c as a susceptibility gene for ASD and highlight mitochondrial signaling pathways as potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - Studies on the ways in which viroids are transmitted are important for understanding their epidemiology and for developing effective control measures for viroid diseases. Viroids may be spread via vegetative propagules, mechanical damage, seed, pollen, or biological vectors. Vegetative propagation is the most prevalent mode of spread at the global, national and local level while further dissemination can readily occur by mechanical transmission through crop handling with viroid-contaminated hands or pruning and harvesting tools. The current knowledge of seed and pollen transmission of viroids in different crops is described. Biological vectors shown to transmit viroids include certain insects, parasitic plants, and goats. Under laboratory conditions, viroids were also shown to replicate in and be transmitted by phytopathogenic ascomycete fungi; therefore, fungi possibly serve as biological vectors of viroids in nature. The term "mycoviroids or fungal viroids" has been introduced in order to denote these viroids. Experimentally, known sequence variants of viroids can be transmitted as recombinant infectious cDNA clones or transcripts. In this review, we endeavor to provide a comprehensive overview of the modes of viroid transmission under both natural and experimental situations. A special focus is the key findings which can be applied to the control of viroid diseases.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to establish a vitrification protocol for ovine preantral follicles, which can retain viability after thawing and to evaluate the impact of different vitrification treatments on apoptosis and development-related gene expression. Preantral follicles were isolated from cortical slices of ovaries by the mechanical method of isolation. The isolated preantral follicles (200-300 mu m) were randomly assigned into four groups. Group1 - Control Fresh preantral follicles (256 follicles); Group 2-Vitrification treatment A (259 follicles) (Vitrification solution 1 (VS1) - Fetal bovine serum (FBS)10%, Ethylene glycol (EG):1.8 M, Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO): 1.4 M, Sucrose-0.3 M for 4 min; VS2- FBS10%, EG:4.5 M, DMSO: 3.5 M, Sucrose:0.3 M for 45 s), Group 3 - Vitr. treatment B (235 follicles) (VS1-FBS 20%, EG:1.3 M, DMS01.05 M for 15 min, VS2- FBS 20%, EG:2.7 M, DMSO:2.1 M for 5 min) and Group 4-Vitrification treatment C (248 follicles) (VS1-Glycerol(Gly):1.2 M for 3 min, VS2- Gly:1.2 M, EG:3.6 M for 3 min, VS3- Gly3M, EG: 4.5 M for 1 min). Preantral follicles were placed in corresponding vitrification treatments and later plunged immediately into liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C). After a week, the follicles were thawed and analyzed for follicular viability by trypan blue dye exclusion method as well as for gene expression. The results showed that the low concentration of cryoprotectants (vitrification treatment B) negatively affected the viability of preantral follicles in comparison with control follicles. There was no significant difference in the viability rates among the Control (87%), Treatment A (79%) and Treatment C (75%). The percentage of viable preantral follicles (73%) derived from Treatment B was significantly decreased (P<0.05%) in comparison to that of control. The expression of apoptotic gene BAK was higher in the vitrification treatment B group. Expressions of the other apoptosis-related genes i.e. Bcl2L1, BAD, BAX, Caspase 3, and Annexin showed no significant difference among the groups. The expression pattern of development competence genes GDF-9 and BMP-15 were higher (P < 0.05) in vitrification treatment A and C, respectively. Expression of NOBOX gene was significantly increased in preantral follicles with Vitrification treatment B compared to the control group. We conclude that both the Vitrification treatment A and Treatment C were the efficient vitrification treatment methods for the vitrification of ovine preantral follicles.

AB  - Introduction and Objective. Correlations between the number of milk somatic cells (SCC), the number of microorganisms, and the content of basic components of milk were studied on five farms (F1-F5) with cows of the same breed, but with different milking systems. Materials and Method. From each farm, 50 Holstein Friesien milk samples were collected once a month (250 samples/ month; n=3,000) during March 2022 - February 2023. Samples from farms F1 and F5 were tested for fat, protein, lactose, no fat dry matter content (FTIR spectroscopy), for the SCC (Fossomatic 7), and for the differential cells (Vetscan DC -Q). Results. The highest fat content was confirmed on farm F5 (3.85 +/- 1.70%) and F4 (3.82 +/- 0.21%) with automatic milking system (AMS). However, from the point of view of protein content, these farms showed slightly lower values (<0.05). F1 did not meet the minimum required amount for fat content (2.84 +/- 0.81%) set by the legislation of the Slovakia. The comparison shows that there is not much difference in cell size between healthy cells and mastitis cells. The average size of healthy cells was approximately 8.77 +/- 0.49 mu m. In the monitored period, the average values determined were at the level of 292,000/mL (5.46 +/- 0.72 log10 SCC) in cow milk samples, while for the rest of the year, the values remained at 256,000/mL (5.40 +/- 0.80 log10 SCC). F1 was categorized as a positive farm with a high TLC (total milk leucocyte count) concentration (5.58 log10 cells/mL, 406.65 +/- 53.80 x 10 3 cells/mL) and a predominant NEU fraction (61%). Farms F2, F4, and F5 were classified as negative farms (TLC was 4.70 +/- 0.26 log10 cells/ml). Conclusions. According to the results, the size of SCCs in healthy milk does not differ from SCCs found in mastitis milk. From the results, it can be concluded that the transition to the latest generation of robotic milking method can positively affect milk production and its quality.

AB  - IntroductionDespite half a century of research on vitamin D (Vit. D), its link to substance abuse and dependence has only been discussed in recent decades. Evidence also shows the involvement of Vit. D in the evolution of dopaminergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens, an increase in the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, and the regulation of dopaminergic processes. The novel idea for this work is taken from a hypothesis given about the effectiveness of Vit. D on dopamine signaling pathway. It is therefore presumed that Vit. D can be considered an effective therapeutic approach for narcotic addiction and substance abuse. MethodsThe animals were assigned into six groups (control, vehicle, Morphine [Mor.], and Vit. D [250, 500, and 1000 IU/kg, i.p.]). Following each conditioning session in a conditioned place preference (CPP) model, the animals received Vit. D. Afterward, the locomotor activity of the animals was assessed using open-field apparatus. Malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), thiol, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured in the brain. The relative DRD2 and GDNF expressions (%) were also measured in the hippocampus. ResultsVit. D administration after Mor. caused a significant increase in the place preference index in the acquisition phase (p < .05). Vit. D altered the oxidation/antioxidation profiles (CAT, SOD, MDA, NO, TAC, and Thiol). Vit. D was more effective than Mor. in the expression of GDNF (p < .0001); however, in the expression of DRD2, this was only the case for 1000 IU Vit. D (p < .0001). ConclusionsConsidering the increased place preference index induced by Mor., it can be concluded that Vit. D interacts via the oxidative pathway and DRD2-GDNF signaling to potentiate the Mor. effect.

AB  - Introduction: The vestibular system's contribution to spatial learning and memory abilities may be clarified using the virtual Morris Water Maze Task (vMWMT). This is important because of the connections between the vestibular system and the hippocampus area. However, there is ongoing debate over the role of the vestibular system in developing spatial abilities. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between Dynamic Visual Acuity (DVA) across three planes and spatial abilities. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted with 50 healthy adults aged 18 to 55 with normal stress levels and mental health and no neurological, audiological, or vestibular complaints. The Trail-Making Test (TMT) Forms A and B for the assessment of executive functions, the DVA test battery for the evaluation of visual motor functions, and the Virtual Morris Water Maze Test (vMWMT) for the assessment of spatial learning and spatial memory were performed. All participants also underwent the Benton Face Recognition Test (BFRT) and Digit Symbol Substitution Tests (DSST) to assess their relation with spatial memory. Results: DVA values in horizontal (H-DVA), vertical (V-DVA), and sagittal (S-DVA) planes ranged from (-0.26) to 0.36 logMAR, (-0.20) to 0.36 logMAR, and (-0.28) to 0.33 logMAR, respectively. The latency of three planes of DVA was affected by vMWMT (Horizontal, Vertical, and Sagittal; Estimate: 22.733, 18.787, 13.341, respectively p < 0.001). Moreover, a moderately significant correlation was also found, with a value of 0.571 between the Virtual MWM test and BFRT and a value of 0.539 between the DSST (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Spatial abilities in healthy adults were significantly influenced by dynamic visual functions across horizontal, vertical, and sagittal planes. These findings are expected to trigger essential discussions about the mechanisms that connect the vestibular-visual system to the hippocampus. The original vMWMT protocol is likely to serve as a model for future studies utilizing this technology.

AB  - Introduction Most living marine organisms have a biphasic life cycle dependent on metamorphosis and settlement. These critical life-history events mean that a developmentally competent larva undergoes a range of coordinated morphological and physiological changes that are in synchrony with the ecological transition from a pelagic to a benthonic lifestyle. Therefore, transition from a pelagic to a benthonic habitat requires multiple adaptations, however, the underlying mechanisms regulating this process still remains unclear. Epigenetic regulation and specifically DNA methylation, has been suggested to be particularly important for organisms to adapt to new environments. Seahorses (Family Syngnathidae, Genus Hippocampus) are a fascinating group of fish, distinguished by their unique anatomical features, reproductive strategy and behavior. They are unique among vertebrate species due to their "male pregnancy", where males nourish developing embryos and larvae in a brood pouch until hatching and parturition occurs. After birth, free-swimming offspring are pelagic and subsequently they change into a demersal lifestyle. Therefore, to begin to address the question whether epigenetic processes could be involved in the transition from a planktonic to a benthonic lifestyle observed in seahorses, we studied global DNA methylation profiles in a tropical seahorse species (Hippocampus reidi) during postnatal development and settlement. Results We performed methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) along with quantitative expression analysis for genes suggested to be involved in the methylation machinery at six age groups: 1, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 days after male's pouch release (DAR). Results revealed that the H. reidi genome has a significantly different DNA methylation profile during postnatal development and settlement on demersal habitats. Moreover, gene expression analysis showed up- and down-regulation of specific DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) encoding genes. Conclusion Our data show that the differences in the DNA methylation patterns seen among developmental stages and during the transition from a pelagic to a benthonic lifestyle suggest a potential for epigenetic regulation of gene expression (through DNA methylation) in this species. Therefore, epigenetic mechanisms could be necessary for seahorse settlement. Nevertheless, if these epigenetic mechanisms come from internal or if they are initiated via external environmental cues should be further investigated.

AB  - Trichogramma dendrolimi Matsumura (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) is one of the most important parasitic natural enemies of Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in peach and pear orchards. The arti-ficial rearing T. dendrolimi have been widely used in biological control programs in recent years. However, its actual parasitic effect on the pest in the field is less, so it is important to develop attractants to increase the parasitic efficiency of the parasitoids. T. dendrolimi can be easily attracted by semiochemicals derived from flowers, intact plants, herbivore-attacked plants, and insects in its orchard habitats. In this paper, 73 semi-ochemicals were evaluated as potential attractants at three concentrations (0.1 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, and 10 mg/ mL) to T. dendrolimi by Y-tube olfactometer bioassays and Electroantennogram (EAG) technology, and then the mixtures of active individual compounds were further tested and evaluated in the field. As a result, 17 individual compounds showed attractive bioactivity to T. dendrolimi. Interestingly, when methyl salicylate and benzalde-hyde mixed with linalool oxide or cis-3-hexenyl caproate in a volume ratio of 10:3:3 respectively showed excellent attractant bioactivity for T. dendrolimi in the orchard field. Thus, introducing such parasitoid attractants in orchard habitat may improve the biological control effect to pests.

AB  - Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are known for their random structural changes throughout their sequence based on the environment. The mechanism underlying these structural changes is difficult to explain. All biological processes are known to follow the direction through which they act. A study of the correlated motion can help to understand the direction of the change. Herein, we introduced the multivariate statistical analysis (MSA) technique to study the correlated motion of the peptide. The correlated motion of the sheep prion peptide was studied with the change in the temperature and solvent. These techniques helped to identify the contributing residual motions that helped to form the different secondary structures of the protein and also the triggering factors that drive these sorts of residual motions. The structural details match the experimentally reported data. It was found that the direction of the change of the secondary structure for this peptide shifted from the C-terminal to the N-terminal with an increase in the temperature. It was found that the involvement of the hydrophobic residues present at the C-terminal and the middle residues (residues 12-17) is responsible for forming a beta-sheet at the normal temperature. Hydration water was found to play an important role in this change. Insights gained from this study can be used to design strategies for desirable structural changes in the IDPs.

AB  - This study aims to characterize for the first time the insect assemblage associated with sown, introduced guayule (Parthenium argentatum A. Gray, Asteraceae) in Castilla-La Mancha, Spain, and identify potential relationships with the crop. Insect sampling was conducted using nets and pan traps during spring and early summer, coinciding with the flowering period of the plant. A total of 352 insect species/morphospecies across 12 orders were identified. Diptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, and Hymenoptera were the most species-rich and abundant orders. Within these orders, Muscidae, Syrphidae, Tenebrionidae, Dermestidae, Miridae, Halictidae, and Apidae were the most numerous families. Guayule flowering intensity increased gradually until mid-June, aligning with the peak activity of pollinating Diptera. The majority of the identified insects (74.4%) were potential pollinators, while nearly 50% were detritivores and approximately 30% were herbivorous. The similarity in insect families and functional roles observed in this study to previous studies in the USA and Mexico suggest that guayule may serve as a similar trophic resource for insects in Spain, despite being a non-native species.

AB  - Queuosine (Q) is a modified nucleoside at the wobble position of specific tRNAs. In mammals, queuosinylation is facilitated by queuine uptake from the gut microbiota and is introduced into tRNA by the QTRT1-QTRT2 enzyme complex. By establishing a Qtrt1 knockout mouse model, we discovered that the loss of Q-tRNA leads to learning and memory deficits. Ribo-Seq analysis in the hippocampus of Qtrt1-deficient mice revealed not only stalling of ribosomes on Q-decoded codons, but also a global imbalance in translation elongation speed between codons that engage in weak and strong interactions with their cognate anticodons. While Q-dependent molecular and behavioral phenotypes were identified in both sexes, female mice were affected more severely than males. Proteomics analysis confirmed deregulation of synaptogenesis and neuronal morphology. Together, our findings provide a link between tRNA modification and brain functions and reveal an unexpected role of protein synthesis in sex-dependent cognitive performance.

AB  - Simple Summary We evaluated the survival and development of a native butterfly (Poanes viator) and introduced moth (Rhizedra lutosa) fed native or introduced lineages of common reed (Phragmites australis). The native butterfly feeds more generally on monocots, so some larvae were also fed wild rice (Zizania aquatica). Using R. lutosa, we also tested an artificial diet supplemented with common reed rhizome powder as a potential food for rearing stalk and rhizome boring Lepidoptera. Generally, both insect species had low larval survival on all plants used, but high pupation success once insects reached that stage. Only P. viator larvae reared on leaves from native plants pupated and completed development. Rhizedra lutosa completed all developmental stages on native and introduced P. australis rhizomes. The artificial diet resulted in a doubling of survival and successful development to adults for R. lutosa. Several specialist Lepidopteran species are being considered for approval as biological control agents for the non-native, invasive common reed in North America, and the convenience and increased larval performance make this artificial diet a good alternative for rearing organisms. This study examined the performance of Poanes viator (Edwards) (Hesperiidae), a native North American skipper, and Rhizedra lutosa (Hubner) (Noctuidae), an introduced moth, reared on native and non-native, invasive lineages of Phragmites australis. Poanes viator is a generalist on monocots and larvae were also fed leaves of Zizania aquatica, a native macrophyte that the skipper commonly uses as a host plant. Larval survival and duration, pupal weight, and pupation time were compared for P. viator feeding on leaf tissue and R. lutosa feeding on rhizomes of either native or introduced plants. We also tested an artificial diet supplemented with P. australis rhizome powder as a potential food for rearing other stalk and rhizome boring Lepidoptera. In experiments using excised plant tissues, some individuals of both species fed and developed to the pupal stage on native and introduced plants, but overall, larval survival rates were low. Plant species/haplotype identity did not cause strong differences in larval survival for either species. However, P. viator larvae only pupated when feeding on native plants (Zizania aquatica and native P. australis haplotypes), whereas R. lutosa successfully pupated on both native and introduced P. australis. Although larval survival was low, 100% of P. viator and 95% of R. lutosa that reached the pupal stage emerged as adults. Rhizedra lutosa larvae fed an artificial diet supplemented with P. australis rhizome powder had significantly greater survival and pupal weights, and shorter pupation times than larvae fed rhizomes only. Several specialist Lepidopteran species are being considered for approval as biological control agents for the non-native P. australis haplotype, and the convenience and increased larval performance make this artificial diet a good alternative for rearing organisms.

AB  - Introduction Azithromycin improves symptomology in various chronic airway diseases exacerbated by viral infections. However, the mechanisms underlying the apparent antiviral effects of azithromycin remain unclear.Methods Airway epithelial cells from healthy children were cultured, expanded and differentiated into air-liquid interface cultures. Submerged and differentiated primary cultures were treated with 10 mu M of AZM for 24 h and subsequently infected with human rhinovirus (HRV)-1b for 24 h. Virus receptor expression, replication, progeny release and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, -6, -8 and IP-10) were then measured. Barrier integrity was determined via qPCR, in-cell western (ICW), immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, confocal microscopy, transepithelial electrical resistance (RT) measurement and an apparent permeability (P app ) assay.Results Treatment with AZM for 24 h at the concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 10 mu M did not have any significant impact on either cellular viability or cytotoxicity in un-infected cells. No significant effect on viral receptor, cytokine expression was observed in non-infected cells treated with 10 mu M AZM. Similarly, there was no significant change in both occludin and ZO-1 expression in non-infected cells. However, claudin-1 gene expression was significantly reduced but corresponding protein expression was significantly increased following 10 mu M AZM. Although RT was significantly lower, this was not corroborated by any significant change in epithelial permeability after 10 mu M AZM treatment. Subsequent to HRV-1b infection, 10 mu M AZM treatment significantly reduced cytotoxicity induced by infection. Viral receptor expression were not affected with AZM pre-treatment but a significant decrease in viral replication was observed. Except for IP-10, expression of IL-1 beta, -6, and -8 was significantly reduced. Gene and protein expression of key epithelial junctions were significantly higher in treated, infected cells, which were concomitant with epithelial barrier function.Discussions This study identified that AZM can protect against HRV-1b-induced epithelial damage. Our data, demonstrating the antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and barrier-protective effects in vitro are strongly indicative of pleiotropic mechanisms of AZM for mitigating viral infection and its consequences. These effects are likely to contribute to the benefits observed in clinical trials of AZM in a number of chronic respiratory diseases.

AB  - This research sought to purify C-phycocyanin (C-PC) from Spirulina platensis and investigate its potential in enhancing the quality parameters and in vivo fertility of ram semen subjected to cooled storage at 5 degrees C, when using a skim milk (SM) based semen extender. The purification process of C-PC involved cold maceration, pre-purification using chitosan and activated charcoal, followed by purification through aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) and ion-exchange chromatography. Afterward, fifty ejaculates were collected from 4 fertile Bouja & acirc;d rams and extended using the SM extender at 37 degrees C, enriched with 0 mu g/mL (control), 1.2 mu g/mL, 2.4 mu g/mL, 3.6 mu g/mL, or 4.8 mu g/mL of C-PC. The diluted semen was subsequently cooled to 5 degrees C using a controlled cooling process, with a gradual cooling rate of approximately 0.5 degrees C per minute, and its quality parameters were evaluated after 0, 4, 8, and 24 h of cooling storage. Then, its fertilization ability after 4 h of cooling storage was evaluated using artificial insemination. The adopted purification process yielded a grade analytical purity of 4.06. Additionally, semen extended in SM with a 2.4 mu g/mL C-PC supplement displayed significant (P < 0.0001) enhancement in total motility, progressive motility, curvilinear velocity, straight-line velocity, average path velocity, viability and lipid peroxidation of ram semen at 0, 4, 8, and 24 h of cooling storage. These improvements were observed in direct comparison to both the control group and the other C-PC concentrations. Regarding fertility rates, semen extended in SM with a 2.4 mu g/mL C-PC recorded a 76 % rate, a notable increment from the 63 % observed in ewes inseminated by semen extended in SM alone, although the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). These findings underscore the promising potential of C-PC as a natural supplement for enhancing semen quality, warranting further investigations.

AB  - Flavonoids are secondary metabolites widely found in plants, which perform various biological activities, such as antiinflammation, antioxidation, antitumor, and so on. Camellia vietnamensis Huang, a species of oil-tea Camellia tree, is an important woody oil crop species widely planted on Hainan Island, which provides health benefits with its high antioxidant activity and abundant flavonoid content. However, very little is known about the overall molecular mechanism of flavonoid biosynthesis in C. vietnamensis Huang. In this study, methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is used as an inducer to change the content of secondary metabolites in C. vietnamensis. Then, the potential mechanisms of flavonoid biosynthesis in C. vietnamensis leaves in response to MeJA were analyzed by metabolomics and transcriptomics (RNA sequencing). The results showed that metabolome analysis detected 104 flavonoids and 74 fatty acyls which showed different expression patterns (increased or decreased expression). It was discovered by KEGG analysis that three differentially accumulated metabolites (cinnamaldehyde, kaempferol and quercitrin) were annotated in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (ko00940), flavonoid biosynthesis (ko00941), and flavone and flavonol biosynthesis (ko00944) pathways. In the transcriptome analysis, 35 different genes involved in the synthesis of flavonoids were identified by MapMan analysis. The key genes (PAL, 4CL, CCR, CHI, CHS, C4H, FLS) that might be involved in the formation of flavonoid were highly expressed after 2 h of MeJA treatment. This study provides new insights and data supporting the molecular mechanism underlying the metabolism and synthesis of flavonoids in C. vietnamensis under MeJA treatment.

AB  - IntroductionAcute stress, as a protective mechanism to respond to an aversive stimulus, can often be accompanied by suppressing pain perception via promoting consistent burst firing of dopamine neurons. Besides, sensitive and advanced research techniques led to the recognition of the mesohippocampal dopaminergic terminals, particularly in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Moreover, previous studies have shown that dopamine receptors within the hippocampal DG play a critical role in induced antinociceptive responses by forced swim stress (FSS) in the presence of inflammatory pain. Since different pain states can trigger various mechanisms and transmitter systems, the present experiments aimed to investigate whether dopaminergic receptors within the DG have the same role in the presence of acute thermal pain.MethodsNinety-seven adult male albino Wistar rats underwent stereotaxic surgery, and a stainless steel guide cannula was unilaterally implanted 1 mm above the DG. Different doses of SCH23390 or sulpiride as D1- and D2-like dopamine receptor antagonists were microinjected into the DG 5-10 min before exposure to FSS, and 5 min after FSS exposure, the tail-flick test evaluated the effect of stress on the nociceptive response at the time-set intervals.ResultsThe results demonstrated that exposure to FSS could significantly increase the acute pain perception threshold, while intra-DG administration of SCH23390 and sulpiride reduced the antinociceptive effect of FSS in the tail-flick test.DiscussionAdditionally, it seems the D2-like dopamine receptor within the DG plays a more prominent role in FSS-induced analgesia in the acute pain model.

AB  - Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is a member of the genus Pestivirus, which causes serious economic losses. The re-emergence of the disease in Japan in 2018 has increased awareness of CSFV. In this study, Balb/c mice were immunized with plant-derived E2 protein, and four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 4B11, 7B3, 11A5 and 6F3 were generated. Two of these mAbs, 4B11 and 7B3, effectively blocked CSFV infection of PK-15 cells. Both mAbs recognized a novel linear epitope, (256)CLIGNTTVKVHASDER(271). The neutralizing ability of anti-CSFV serum decreased 63%, when pre-incubated with the linear peptide at 200 mu g/mL. Structural analysis showed that this linear epitope is present at the border of Domain C and Domain D on the surface of the E2 protein. Alignment of amino acid sequences showed that the epitope was conserved in different subgroups of CSFV but not in other members of the Pestivirus genus. Consistently with the analysis above, this epitope distinguished antibodies against CSFV from those against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). Our study provides an ideal candidate peptide for new vaccine design and differential diagnosis of CSFV. These findings will contribute to the control and eradication of classical swine fever.

AB  - The most notable progress in renal clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC) in the past decades is the introduction of drugs targeting the VHL-HIF signaling pathway-associated angiogenesis. However, mechanisms underlying the development of VHL mutation-independent ccRCC are unclear. Here we provide evidence that the disrupted Hippo-YAP signaling contributes to the development of ccRCC independent of VHL alteration. We found that YAP1 and its primary target genes are frequently upregulated in ccRCC and the upregulation of these genes is associated with unfavorable patient outcomes. Research results derived from our in vitro and in vivo experimental models demonstrated that, under normoxic conditions, hyperactivated YAP1 drives the expression of FGFs to stimulate the proliferation of tumor and tumor-associated endothelial cells in an autocrine/paracrine manner. When rapidly growing cancer cells create a hypoxic environment, hyperactivated YAP1 in cancer cells induces the production of VEGF, which promotes the angiogenesis of tumor-associated endothelial cells, leading to improved tumor microenvironment and continuous tumor growth. Our study indicates that hyperactivated YAP1 is essential for maintaining ccRCC progression, and targeting the dual role of hyperactivated YAP1 represents a novel strategy to improve renal carcinoma therapy.

AB  - The term "Agriculture 4.0" emerged from the term "Industry 4.0" like amany other "4.0" terms. However, are Industry 4.0 technologies and concepts really applicable to agriculture? Are the benefits that Industry 4.0 brings to industrial use cases transferable to livestock farming? This paper tries to answer this question for the three dominant sectors of livestock farming in Central Europe and Germany: Poultry, pig fattening, and dairy farming. These sectors are analyzed along with the eight most relevant Industry 4.0 benefits. The results show that only part of the Industry 4.0 benefits are relevant for livestock farming in a similar manner as in industrial production. Due to basic differences between industrial and livestock farming use cases, some of the benefits must be adapted. The presence of individual living animals and the strong environmental impact of livestock farming affect the role of digital individualization and demand orientation. The position of livestock farming within the value chain minimizes the need for flexibilization. The introduction and adoption of Industry 4.0 concepts and technologies may contribute significantly to transforming agriculture into something that may be called Agriculture 4.0. Technologies are indispensable for this development step, but vocational education and open-mindedness of farmers towards Industry 4.0 is essential as well.

AB  - Purpose: To analyze statistically derived threshold values of volumetric MRI and 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET asymmetry, independent of normative data, for non-invasive detection/exclusion of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).Methods: We retrospectively analyzed amygdalohippocampal volumetry and temporal FDG PET metabolism in 33 patients (age: 29.27 +/- 8.56 years) who underwent surgery following Stereo-EEG implantation and had postsurgical seizure freedom lasting >12 months. The temporal lobe epilepsy group and the extratemporal lobe epilepsy (ETLE) group were compared. Percentage volume loss (PVL) was calculated from manually traced amygdalohippocampal volumetry whereas percentage metabolic loss (PML) was calculated from PET using amygdalohippocampal trace and temporal neocortical Brodmann areas (BA) template.Results: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis identified a cutoff hippocampal PVL of 4.21% as the minimum indicating probable hippocampal involvement in seizure onset, with sensitivity of 88.89% and the specificity of 100% (p < 0.001). Region of interest (ROI)-based PML values in PET imaging showed a significant correlation with the presence of TLE in the TLE group of patients and its absence in the ETLE group of patients. Region of interest curve analysis yielded PML cutoffs of 5.77% and 8.36%, respectively, for the hippocampus and BA 38 (temporopolar neocortex) to detect TLE with the sensitivity of 72.7% and specificity of 77.8%.Conclusion: We describe statistical thresholds for asymmetry analysis of hippocampal volumetry and FDG PET to improve detection of TLE. These threshold parameters warrant further validation in prospective studies. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - IntroductionAlzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that alters learning and memory processes. Kalanchoe crenata (Crassulaceae) has long been used in Cameroonian traditional medicine to treat hypertension, malaria, and dementia. The present study aims to evaluate the anti-amnesic effect of an aqueous extract of K. crenata in D-galactose-treated rats and possible mechanisms of action.MethodsMemory impairment was induced in rats by subcutaneous injection of D-galactose (350 mg/kg) once daily for 30 days. At the end of the procedure, the animals were assessed for memory impairment using Morris water maze and object recognition tasks. Animals with memory impairment were divided into six groups of eight rats each and treated once daily for 24 days as follows: the negative control group received per os distilled water (10 mL/kg); the positive control group received donepezil (2 mg/kg, p.o.); and three test groups received the extract of K. crenata (62, 124, and 248 mg/kg, p.o.). A group of eight rats was added and served as a control group. After completion of the procedure, the memory deficit in rats was reassessed by the object recognition test on Day 15 of the treatment, the Morris water maze test on Day 18, and the open-field test on Day 24. At the end of behavioral experiments, the animals were sacrificed and some biochemical parameters in the hippocampus were estimated. In addition, histological analysis of the hippocampus was performed.ResultsK. crenata significantly decreased the time to reach the platform and increased the time spent in the target quadrant of the Morris water maze. It also increased the discrimination index during the object recognition test. The extract significantly reversed D-galactose-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. This was confirmed by the attenuation of neuronal loss.ConclusionThese findings suggest that K. crenata extract possesses an anti-amnesic-like effect probably mediated by antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.

AB  - Glucosinolates are specialized defensive metabolites characteristic of the Brassicales order. Among them, aliphatic and indolic glucosinolates (IGs) are usually highly abundant in species from the Brassicaceae family. The exceptions this trend are species representing a subclade of the Camelineae tribe, including Capsella and Camelina genera, which have reduced capacity to produce and metabolize IGs. Our study addresses the contribution of specific glucosinolate-related myeloblastosis (MYB) transcription factors to this unprecedented backward evolution of IG biosynthesis. To this end, we performed phylogenomic and functional studies of respective MYB proteins. The obtained results revealed weakened conservation of glucosinolate-related MYB transcription factors, including loss of functional MYB34 protein, in the investigated species. We showed that the introduction of functional MYB34 from Arabidopsis thaliana partially restores IG biosynthesis in Capsella rubella, indicating that the loss of this transcription factor contributes to the backward evolution of this metabolic pathway. Finally, we performed an analysis of the impact of particular myb mutations on the feedback loop in IG biosynthesis, which drives auxin overproduction, metabolic dysregulation and strong growth retardation caused by mutations in IG biosynthetic genes. This uncovered the unique function of MYB34 among IG-related MYBs in this feedback regulation and consequently in IG conservation in Brassicaceae plants.

AB  - Changes in climate may cause changes in the ranges, phenology and interactions of insects with other species and lead parasites to switch host species. A study of louse (flat) flies in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and Isle of Man, in which licensed bird ringers acting as citizen scientists collected ectoparasites that left birds during ringing, showed recent range shifts of several species. The Common or Bird Louse Fly Ornithomya avicularia (Linnaeus, 1758), a vector of Haemoproteus sp. and trypanosomes, has undergone a major northwards range expansion of over 300 km in the United Kingdom (UK) since the 1960s. The Finch Louse Fly Ornithomya fringillina (Curtis, 1836) has also expanded its range over 300 km northwards and 400 km westwards into the Island of Ireland, and the Swallow Louse Fly Ornithomya biloba (Dufour, 1827) is now established in Wales and Southern England. The Grouse Louse Fly Ornithomya chloropus (Bergroth, 1901) has undergone a range contraction at lower altitudes and on the southern edge of its range. Other species of louse fly were detected: Crataerina pallida (Latreille, 1812), Stenepteryx hirundinis (Linnaeus, 1758), Pseudolynchia garzettae (Rondani, 1879) and Icosta minor (Bigot, 1858). Some generalist species have shifted their phenology, whereas the more specialist nest parasites of migrant birds have not, as the arrival and breeding dates of their hosts have not changed. The range changes of the generalist species of these ectoparasites may have implications for bird health, especially if they switch to new host species as their ranges shift.

AB  - Introduction Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a severe neuropsychiatric complication of liver diseases characterized by neuroinflammation. The efficacies of nonabsorbable rifaximin (RIF) and lactulose (LAC) have been well documented in the treatment of HE. [F-18]PBR146 is a translocator protein (TSPO) radiotracer used for in vivo neuroinflammation imaging. This study investigated anti-neuroinflammation effect of RIF or/and LAC in chronic HE rats by [F-18]PBR146 micro-PET/CT. Methods Bile duct ligation (BDL) operation induced chronic HE models, and this study included Sham+normal saline (NS), BDL+NS, BDL+RIF, BDL+LAC, and BDL+RIF+LAC groups. Behavioral assessment was performed to analyze the motor function, and fecal samples were collected after successfully established the chronic HE model (more than 28 days post-surgery). In addition, fecal samples collection and micro-PET/CT scans were performed sequentially. And we also collected the blood plasma, liver, intestinal, and brain samples after sacrificing the rats for further biochemical and pathological analyses. Results The RIF- and/or LAC-treated BDL rats showed similar behavioral results with Sham+NS group, while the treatment could not reverse the biliary obstruction resulting in sustained liver injury. The RIF or/and LAC treatments can inhibit IFN-gamma and IL-10 productions. The global brain uptake values of [F-18]PBR146 in BDL+NS group was significantly higher than other groups (p < .0001). The brain regions analysis showed that the basal ganglia, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex had radiotracer uptake differences among groups (all p < .05), which were consistent with the brain immunohistochemistry results. Sham+NS group was mainly enriched in Christensenella, Coprobacillus, and Pseudoflavonifractor. BDL+NS group was mainly enriched in Barnesiella, Alloprevotella, Enterococcus, and Enterorhabdus. BDL+RIF+LAC group was enriched in Parabacteroides, Bacteroides, Allobaculum, Bifidobacterium, and Parasutterella. Conclusions RIF or/and LAC had anti-neuroinflammation in BDL-induced chronic HE rats with gut microbiota alterations. The [F-18]PBR146 could be used for monitoring RIF or/and LAC treatment efficacy of chronic HE rats.

AB  - Introduction: Animal nutritional strategies have been extensively studied in vertebrates, where generalism at the individual scale is the rule. In insect herbivores, the determinants of the nutritional strategy of individual-scale generalists remain poorly studied, and the focus has been placed mainly on the influence of plant defense. Moreover, the integration of a physiological dimension in such studies remains rare. Here, we investigated the determinants of the nutritional strategy of pre-diapausing pollen beetles, Brassicogethes aeneus, with a focus on the influence of macronutrients. Before their diapause, pollen beetles are known to feed from plants belonging to many different families. This raises three questions: (i) Is the generalism of pollen beetles a populational consequence of individuals specialized on different plant families? (ii) Do individuals feed at random on flowers available or do they have a particular nutritional strategy? and (iii) In case of nonrandom feeding choices, do pollen macronutrients explain this nutritional strategy?
   Methods: To answer these questions, we used a series of laboratory experiments including feeding choice tests on flowers and artificial substrates, quantification of pollen nutrient content, quantification of the insect energetic budget, and performance experiments.
   Results: We show that pollen beetles are generalist at the individual scale, and that clear and stable food preferences are established over a few hours in a multi-choice context. Pollen beetles prefer to feed on flowers with a carbohydrate-rich pollen, and this preference is adaptive since performance correlates positively with the plant carbohydrate content. This better performance may be explained by the fact that individuals feeding on carbohydrate-rich resources accumulate more glycogen and total energetic reserves.
   Discussion: This study represents one of the few evidences of generalism at the individual scale in an herbivorous insect. It provides a better understanding of the nutritional strategy of a non-bee pollen feeder and shows the importance of carbohydrates in this strategy. It highlights the need to combine assessments of the plant macronutrient content and insect energetic budget in an adaptive framework to better understand the nutritional strategies of herbivores.

AB  - 1. Plants lose a remarkable amount of energy to herbivorous animals, and this damage has substantial impacts on plant fitness and species' distributions. There are many ways ecologists can measure leaf damage, with some methods being more time-consuming than others. Due to a high variance in herbivory, accurate quantification of damage at the population level requires sampling of many leaves. A simple yet effective solution to this problem is to estimate leaf damage visually.
   2. Visually estimating leaf damage may be less accurate than scanning methods, but visual estimates of leaf damage are much faster than digital measurements. Using simulations, we show that gathering larger quantities of data at a slightly higher level of inaccuracy gives a more accurate estimate of a population's over-all leaf damage than fewer, exact measurements.
   3. We then introduce the ZAX Herbivory Trainer, a free online application that teaches researchers to accurately visually estimate leaf damage. On average, users took similar to 9 min and 48 images to complete our trainer which significantly decreased their estimate inaccuracy from 13.2% to 6%. This low level of inaccuracy can be retained up to 3 months post-training so researchers can use the ZAX Herbivory Trainer once prior to short fieldwork or every 3 months for extensive fieldwork. We also recommend a cut-off point, whereby if a person has not completed the app in 17.5 min or 85 images (90th percentile), they may not be suitable to estimate herbivory for research purposes.
   4. The ZAX Herbivory Trainer will allow researchers of any experience level to assess herbivory quickly and accurately in a globally standardised way. International collaborators, students and citizen scientists can all find use in this app, no matter the scale of their projects. From this we can gather better data to address big picture questions in ecology such as patterns in herbivory relating to latitude or climate change.

AB  - With nearly 80% urbanization, South America faces critical challenges in managing municipal solid waste, particularly the continued reliance on landfilling and the prevalence of open dumps. The region's rapid population growth, high organic waste content and inadequate infrastructure further exacerbate health and environmental risks. In response to increasing international attention on dumpsite closure, this study examines the potential for system transitions by drawing lessons from the evolution of waste management in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (MV), a rural and less industrialized state in Germany. Following the reunification of Germany in 1990, eastern states, such as MV, were required to adopt national waste regulations that had already been implemented in the west. The transition from dumping and informal practices such as feeding biowaste to pigs, to the establishment of source separation, composting and energy recovery offers relevant insights for mid-sized cities in Latin America seeking sustainable alternatives to open dumping. Using a comparative approach, the study reviews trends in waste dumping across 12 South American countries, alongside a historical and regulatory analysis of Germany's transformation. Key findings transition was driven by policy and regulatory reforms, political will at the national level, harmonization of standards across federal states and a national strategy to reduce methane emissions from landfills. Additional pillars of success included the introduction of a compost quality assurance system, cost-recovery financing mechanisms and differentiated user fees to incentivize source separation.

AB  - BackgroundThe selection of panellists in dynamic olfactometry traditionally relies on their sensitivity to n-Butanol. The introduction of secondary reference odour mass (SROM), as proposed in the updated standard EN 13725:2022, offers a potential improvement in the selection process and, consequently, in odour quantification accuracy. This study was conducted at the Laboratorio Olfattometrico of Politecnico di Milano, using the new standardized procedure outlined in EN 13725:2022. This study measured and calculated the SROM values for four odorants (dimethyl sulphide, toluene, methanethiol and acetaldehyde), comparing the results with odour thresholds available in the literature.ResultsThe research's findings show that sulphur-containing compounds, such as dimethyl sulphide and methanethiol, have lower SROM values, respectively 0.0015 and 0.000066 mu mol/mol, indicating higher odour potency compared to the other tested substances (SROMtoluene = 0.77 mu mol/mol and SROMacetaldehyde = 0.024 mu mol/mol). Focusing on the examiners' response, a slight correlation between their response to investigated odorants and n-Butanol is found. In addition, the response of examiners to odorants is generally found to be less variable compared to their response to n-Butanol under the test conditions. A different trend emerges when comparing the panellists' responses to n-Butanol and acetaldehyde: the variability between individual responses is higher for acetaldehyde, and there is a slight negative correlation between the responses to the two substances.ConclusionsThis study provides specific SROM values and experimental evidence supporting the integration of odorant-specific reference materials into panel selection procedures, with the aim of enhancing the reliability of dynamic olfactometry.

Numerous studies have been conducted to explore the mitigation potential of various approaches, although few have examined the systematic NH3 emission mitigation potential when considering both crop and livestock systems based on coherent in situ measurement results. Herein, we design an optimal system wherein coupled crop and layer production systems reveal feasible approaches for significant mitigation potential at each stage of the process. Specifically, these measures involve (i) using a low crude protein (LCP) feed, (ii) composting manure with certain additives, and (iii) substituting manure with optimal fertilization in a summer maize-winter wheat cropping system. The results show that (i) LCP feed leads to a 14 % reduction in NH3 emissions at the housing stage, (ii) introducing additives during the composing stage reduces NH3 emissions by 16 %-46 %, and (iii) the NH3 reduction potential reaches 35 %-44 % at the field application stage. In the overall crop-layer system, the optimal system with the improved management strategy applied at every stage results in a 48 % and 56 % reduction in NH3 emissions for per unit eggs and grain production, respectively, relative to a traditional production system. This study confirms that NH3 emissions can be cut in half by implementing optimal crop-livestock systems with appropriate mitigation approaches. This is a feasible model that can be promoted and extended in various agricultural areas, which together with technological, policy, and economic support can enable significant mitigation potential for sustainable agriculture development.

AB  - Introduction Increasing age is the number one risk factor for developing cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease. Aged humans and mice exhibit numerous molecular changes that contribute to a decline in cognitive function and increased risk of developing age-associated diseases. Here, we characterize multiple age-associated changes in male C57BL/6J mice to understand the translational utility of mouse aging. Methods Male C57BL/6J mice from various ages between 2 and 24 months of age were used to assess behavioral, as well as, histological and molecular changes across three modalities: neuronal, microgliosis/neuroinflammation, and the neurovascular unit (NVU). Additionally, a cohort of 4- and 22-month-old mice was used to assess blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. Mice in this cohort were treated with a high, acute dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg) or saline control 6 h prior to sacrifice followed by tail vein injection of 0.4 kDa sodium fluorescein (100 mg/kg) 2 h later. Results Aged mice showed a decline in cognitive and motor abilities alongside decreased neurogenesis, proliferation, and synapse density. Further, neuroinflammation and circulating proinflammatory cytokines were increased in aged mice. Additionally, we found changes at the BBB, including increased T cell infiltration in multiple brain regions and an exacerbation in BBB leakiness following chemical insult with age. There were also a number of readouts that were unchanged with age and have limited utility as markers of aging in male C57BL/6J mice. Conclusions Here we propose that these changes may be used as molecular and histological readouts that correspond to aging-related behavioral decline. These comprehensive findings, in the context of the published literature, are an important resource toward deepening our understanding of normal aging and provide an important tool for studying aging in mice.

AB  - Women are at a higher risk of cognitive impairments and Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly after the menopause, when the estrous cycle becomes irregular and diminishes. Numerous studies have shown that estrogen deficiency, especially estradiol (E2) deficiency, plays a key role in this phenomenon. Recently, a novel polymeric drug, hyaluronic acid-17 beta-estradiol conjugate (HA-E2), has been introduced for the delivery of E2 to brain tissues. Studies have indicated that HA-E2 crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and facilitates a prolonged E2 release profile while lowering the risk of estrogen-supplement-related side effects. In this study, we used ovariohysterectomy (OHE) rats, a postmenopausal cognitive deficit model, to explore the effect of a 2-week HA-E2 treatment (210 ng/kg body weight, twice a week) on the cholinergic septo-hippocampal innervation system, synaptic transmission in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and cognitive improvements. Our study revealed an 11% rise in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) expression in both the medial septal nucleus (MS nucleus) and the hippocampus, along with a 14-18% increase in dendritic spine density in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, following HA-E2 treatment in OHE rats. These enhancements prompted the recovery of cognitive functions such as spatial learning and memory. These findings suggest that HA-E2 may prevent and improve estrogen-deficiency-induced cognitive impairment and AD.

AB  - As mining engineering progresses into the deep excavation phase, the intensification of high pressure, high temperature, strong disturbances, and complex geological conditions becomes increasingly prominent. Researchers perform stability analysis on the excavation area to reduce potential safety hazards during the extraction process. Developing a detailed numerical calculation model that accurately reflects the true geological structure is essential for numerical simulation analysis in mining engineering. Based on the excellent 3D geological modeling capabilities of 3D Mine software, this paper introduces a new 3D geological and numerical unified modeling method (3DMine-Rhino-HyperMesh) involving multi-software coupling and details the specific steps and concepts of this modeling approach. Subsequently, using a certain open-pit mine in Panzhihua as a backdrop, a detailed geological and numerical unified model is established, reflecting the true geological structure of the mining area, and the potential failure mechanisms of the mine slope are analyzed. The results indicate that the modeling method aligns well with the actual geological conditions, enhancing the grid quality of the numerical model and offering a new modeling approach for simulating and analyzing large complex geological entities in mining operations.

AB  - Navigation through space involves learning and representing relationships between past, current, and future locations. In mammals, this might rely on the hippocampal theta phase code, where in each cycle of the theta oscillation, spatial representations provided by neuronal sequences start behind the animal's true location and then sweep forward. However, the exact relationship between theta phase, represented position and true location remains unclear and even paradoxical. Here, we formalize previous notions of 'spatial' or 'temporal' theta sweeps that have appeared in the literature. We analyze single-cell and population variables in unit recordings from rat CA1 place cells and compare them to model simulations based on each of these schemes. We show that neither spatial nor temporal sweeps quantitatively accounts for how all relevant variables change with running speed. To reconcile these schemes with our observations, we introduce 'behavior-dependent' sweeps, in which theta sweep length and place field properties, such as size and phase precession, vary across the environment depending on the running speed characteristic of each location. These behavior-dependent spatial maps provide a structured heterogeneity that is essential for understanding the hippocampal code.

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting has advantages for constructing artificial skin tissues in replicating the structures and functions of native skin. Although many studies have presented improved effect of printing skin substitutes in wound healing, using hydrogel inks to fabricate 3D bioprinting architectures with complicated structures, mimicking mechanical properties, and appropriate cellular environments is still challenging. Inspired by collagen nanofibers withstanding stress and regulating cell behavior, a patterned nanofibrous film was introduced to the printed hydrogel scaffold to fabricate a composite artificial skin substitute (CASS). The artificial dermis was printed using gelatin-hyaluronan hybrid hydrogels containing human dermal fibroblasts with gradient porosity and integrated with patterned nanofibrous films simultaneously, while the artificial epidermis was formed by seeding human keratinocytes upon the dermis. The collagen-mimicking nanofibrous film effectively improved the tensile strength and fracture resistance of the CASS, making it sewable for firm implantation into skin defects. Meanwhile, the patterned nanofibrous film also provided the biological cues to guide cell behavior. Consequently, CASS could effectively accelerate the regeneration of large-area skin defects in mouse and pig models by promoting re-epithelialization and collagen deposition. This research developed an effective strategy to prepare composite bioprinting architectures for enhancing mechanical property and regulating cell behavior, and CASS could be a promising skin substitute for treating large-area skin defects.

AB  - Numerous predators prey on herbivorous arthropods, and some prey species have evolved counterattacks against predators (predator-prey reversal). Counterattacks often entail a lethal cost but increase the fitness of the attacking individuals and their nearby relatives. Spider mites (Acari: Tetranychidae) live on leaf surfaces, and some live in aggregations with relatives in a web nest. Counterattacks have been studied in Stigmaeopsis species, but have rarely been studied in other web-nesting species. We investigated counterattacks against predatory thrips, Scolothrips takahashii Priesner, by Schizotetranychus brevisetosus Ehara, which inhabits Quercus glauca L. (Fagaceae). Here, thrips nymphs introduced onto a mite-infested piece of leaf quickly entered the nest but were driven out by females using their stylets. However, in another experiment, we could not find a difference between treatments (10 adult females per leaf or none per leaf) in the number of eggs consumed at 48 h, probably because the thrips repeatedly re-entered the nest. Additionally, we did not detect a significant effect of web presence on predation. Although the defensive effect is undetectable, this study shows that S. brevisetosus counterattacks occur both inside and outside the nest, and the latter especially is the first report of such behaviour in Acari.

AB  - During a survey of saprobic fungal niches in Southwestern China, eighteen ascomycetous collections of Nigrograna (Nigrogranaceae, Pleosporales, Dothideomycetes) were found on dead branches of medicinal plants. These taxa were characterized and identified based on morphological and culture characteristics, and phylogenetic analyses of a combined the internal transcribed spacer region of rDNA (ITS), nuclear large subunit rDNA (28S, LSU), RNA polymerase second-largest subunit (rpb2), nuclear small subunit rDNA (18S, SSU), and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1-alpha) sequence dataset also confirmed their placement. As a result, four novel species, namely Nigrograna camelliae, N. guttulata, N. longiorostiolata and N. neriicola were described. Additionally, four new host records of N. acericola, N. magnoliae, N. oleae and N. thymi were introduced. Furthermore, this study addresses the taxonomic status of N. trachycarpi, proposing its synonymy under N. oleae. Detailed illustrations, descriptions and informative notes for each newly identified taxon and novel host record are provided in this study.

AB  - Introduction Diabetes Mellitus (DM) constitutes a global epidemic and is one of the top ten leading causes of mortality (WHO, 2019), projected to rank seventh by 2030. The US National Diabetes Statistics Report (2021) states that 38.4 million Americans have diabetes. Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is an FDA-approved target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, current DPP-4 inhibitors may cause adverse effects, including gastrointestinal issues, severe joint pain (FDA safety warning), nasopharyngitis, hypersensitivity, and nausea. Moreover, the development of novel drugs and the in vivo assessment of DPP-4 inhibition are both costly and often impractical. These challenges highlight the urgent need for efficient in-silico approaches to facilitate the discovery and optimization of safer and more effective DPP-4 inhibitors.Methodology Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a widely used computational approach for evaluating the properties of chemical substances. In this study, we employed a Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) approach, specifically the Logic Tensor Network (LTN), to develop a DPP-4 QSAR model capable of identifying potential small-molecule inhibitors and predicting bioactivity classification. For comparison, we also implemented baseline models using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Transformers. A total of 6,563 bioactivity records (SMILES-based compounds with IC50 values) were collected from ChEMBL, PubChem, BindingDB, and GTP. Feature sets used for model training included descriptors (CDK Extended-PaDEL), fingerprints (Morgan), chemical language model embeddings (ChemBERTa-2), LLaMa 3.2 embedding features, and physicochemical properties.Results Among all tested configurations, the Neuro-symbolic QSAR model (NeSyDPP-4) performed best using a combination of CDK extended and Morgan fingerprints. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.9725, an F1-score of 0.9723, an ROC AUC of 0.9719, and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.9446. These results outperformed the baseline DNN and Transformer models, as well as existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. To further validate the robustness of the model, we conducted an external evaluation using the Drug Target Common (DTC) dataset, where NeSyDPP-4 also demonstrated strong performance, with an accuracy of 0.9579, an AUC-ROC of 0.9565, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.9171, and an F1-score of 0.9577.Discussion These findings suggest that the NeSyDPP-4 model not only delivered high predictive performance but also demonstrated generalizability to external datasets. This approach presents a cost-effective and reliable alternative to traditional vivo screening, offering valuable support for the identification and classification of biologically active DPP-4 inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

AB  - Globalization, increased frequency of travel, and a rise in legal and illegal animal trades can introduce exotic ticks into the United States. We herein report the importation of a male Rhipicephalus pulchellus (Gerstacker) on a human traveler returning to Connecticut from Tanzania, Africa, and review historical importation records of this species into the United States. This common tick is broadly distributed throughout East Africa, from Eritrea to Tanzania, has a wide host range on domestic animals and wildlife, and has been most frequently introduced into the United States on tick-infested wild animal hosts and animal trophies, but documentation of importation on humans has been rare. Archival records at the United States Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratories show R. pulchellus has been introduced into the United States at least 40 times over the last 62 yr. Rhipicephalus pulchellus has been linked to Rickettsia conorii, the agent of boutonneuse fever in humans, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus, and Nairobi sheep disease orthonairovirus. Given the potential for this exotic tick to introduce animal or human pathogens, proper surveillance, interception, identification, and reporting of these ticks are vital in protecting human and animal health.

AB  - This study aimed to prepare a novel "self-regenerative" electrochemical biosensor by successively modifying gold nanoparticles, four-arm polyethylene glycol-NH2, and NH2-MIL-53 (Al) (MOF) on the glassy carbon electrode interface. A hairpin G-triplex-mediated DNA (G3 probe) as a part of the mycoplasma ovine pneumonia (MO) gene was loosely adsorbed to MOF. Based on the mechanism of hybridization induction, the G3 probe could effectively detach from the MOF only after introducing the target DNA. Subsequently, its guanine-rich nucleic acid se-quences were exposed to solution of methylene blue. As a result, the diffusion current of the sensor system showed a sharp decline. The developed biosensor showed excellent selectivity, and the concentration of target DNA exhibited a good correlation in the range 10-10 to 10-6 M with a detection limit of 1.00 pM (S/N = 3), even in 10% goat serum. Most interestingly, this biosensor interface automatically started the regeneration program. Moreover, regeneration could be effectively achieved at least seven times, and the recovery rate of the electrode interface and sensing efficiency was up to 90%. Additionally, this platform could be used for other clinical assays in various systems by simply changing the DNA sequence of the probe.

AB  - Conductive hydrogels are characterized by their extraordinary stretchability, flexibility, and biocompatibility, making them ideal materials for flexible wearable sensors. However, they often encounter challenges such as freezing and water loss, which can adversely affect their conductivity and stretching performance. In this study, we introduce a conductive hydrogel incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG), acrylic acid (AA), acrylamide (AM), and lithium chloride (LiCl), which exhibits low-temperature tolerance, resistance to drying, self-adhesion, and mechanical robustness. The hydrogel's excellent mechanical properties, including an elongation at break of 1120% and a toughness of 2.9 MJ m(-3), are attributed to the formation of a tight polymer network between P(AA-AM) and PEG through hydrogen bonding. The multiple hydrogen bonding system between PEG and the polymer networks, combined with the hydration of LiCl and electrostatic interactions between the carboxyl group and Li+, significantly enhances the hydrogel's freezing resistance (down to -60 degrees C), water retention (with only 20% water loss after 15 days), and self-adhesion (with an adhesion strength to pig skin of up to 55.08 kPa). When employed as a flexible sensor, the P(AA-AM)/PEG/LiCl hydrogel exhibited excellent sensing properties for monitoring various human motions, with an impressive gauge factor of 1.91 and electrical conductivity of 4.50 S m(-1) Moreover, it maintained a high electrical conductivity (3.82 S m(-1)) even at -20 degrees C. The conductive hydrogel consistently produced stable and reliable electrical signals in response to external mechanical stimuli, making it a preferred material for human motion monitoring.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignancy that occurs worldwide and is generally associated with poor prognosis. The development of resistance to targeted therapies such as sorafenib is a major challenge in clinical cancer treatment. In the present study, Ten-eleven translocation protein 1 (TET1) was found to be highly expressed in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells and knockdown of TET1 can substantially improve the therapeutic effect of sorafenib on HCC, indicating the potential important roles of TET1 in sorafenib resistance in HCC. Mechanistic studies determined that TET1 and Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) synergistically regulate the promoter methylation and gene expression of DNA repair-related genes in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. RNA sequencing indicated the activation of DNA damage repair signaling was extensively suppressed by the TET1 inhibitor Bobcat339. We also identified TET1 as a direct transcriptional target of YAP1 by promoter analysis and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. Furthermore, we showed that Bobcat339 can overcome sorafenib resistance and synergized with sorafenib to induce tumor eradication in HCC cells and mouse models. Finally, immunostaining showed a positive correlation between TET1 and YAP1 in clinical samples. Our findings have identified a previously unrecognized molecular pathway underlying HCC sorafenib resistance, thus revealing a promising strategy for cancer therapy.

AB  - The accidentally introduced ragweed leaf beetle (Ophraella communa) is a most promising biological control agent for common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), which herbivore has already emerged in several areas of the Palearctic region. The aim of our study was to model the expansion of O. communa and the number of generations in the various Palearctic regions. Furthermore, our objective was to determine the effect of the prevailing wind on the direction of its spread and to ascertain the relationship between the green biomass production of ragweed and individual numbers of this leaf beetle. According to our meta-analytical findings, the advancement of O. communa is continuous in the Palearctic areas. This phytophagous insect invades new habitats, which are occupied by A. artemisiifolia, and spreads quickly. The stable populations of O. communa seem to be strictly linked to the presence of its primary host, A. artemisiifolia. We show that the rapid spread of this insect is due to the combination of wind direction and topography features, which was reinforced by our analysis. O. communa possesses uniformly multivoltine populations in its Palearctic habitats. So, insects possessing facultative diapause are able to colonize northern areas depending on the presence of their host, which statement is based on the processing of 143 East- and 68 West-Palearctic records According to our investigations, the mass appearance of this phytophagous insect coincided with the assimilation peak of its main host, common ragweed.

AB  - As the amygdala is associated with fear and anxiety, it is important to determine the potential effects of gestational stressors on behavior and stress responses in offspring. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of prenatal transportation stress on amygdala gene expression in 25-day-old Brahman calves, focusing on sex-specific differences. Amygdala tissue samples from prenatally stressed (PNS) and control bull and heifer calves were analyzed using RNA sequencing. A thorough outlier detection process, utilizing visual inspection of multidimensional scaling plots, robust principal component analysis, and PCAGrid methods, led to the exclusion of 5 of 32 samples from subsequent analyses. Differential expression analysis revealed no significant treatment differences between the control and PNS groups within either sex. However, sex-specific differences in gene expression were identified in both the control and PNS groups. The control group showed seven differentially expressed genes between sexes, while ten were identified between PNS males and females, with seven located on the X chromosome. Among these was the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9 X-linked gene, which plays a role in neurodevelopmental pathways. When comparing males to females, regardless of treatment, a total of 58 genes were differentially expressed, with 45 showing increased expression in females. Gene enrichment analysis indicated that many differentially expressed genes are associated with infectious disease-related pathways. Future research should explore amygdala size and functional responses to various postnatal stimuli.

AB  - Classical swine fever (CSF) and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) are highly contagious viral diseases that pose a significant threat to piglets and cause substantial economic losses in the global swine industry. Therefore, the development of a bivalent vaccine capable of targeting both CSF and PED simultaneously is crucial. In this study, we genetically engineered a recombinant classical swine fever virus (rCSFV) expressing the antigenic domains of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) based on the modified infectious cDNA clone of the vaccine strain C-strain. The S1N and COE domains of PEDV were inserted into C-strain cDNA clone harboring the mutated 136th residue of N-pro and substituted 3 & PRIME;UTR to generate the recombinant chimeric virus vC/SM3 & PRIME;UTRN-S1NCOE. To improve the efficacy of the vaccine, we introduced the tissue plasminogen activator signal (tPAs) and CARD domain of the signaling molecule VISA into vC/SM3 & PRIME;UTRN-S1NCOE to obtain vC/SM3 & PRIME;UTRN-tPAsS1NCOE and vC/SM3 & PRIME;UTRN-CARD/tPAsS1NCOE, respectively. We characterized three vaccine candidates in vitro and investigated their immune responses in rabbits and pigs. The N-D136N(pro) mutant exhibited normal autoprotease activity and mitigated the inhibition of IFN-& beta; induction. The introduction of tPAs and the CARD domain led to the secretory expression of the S1NCOE protein and upregulated IFN-& beta; induction in infected cells. Immunization with recombinant CSFVs expressing secretory S1NCOE resulted in a significantly increased in PEDV-specific antibody production, and coexpression of the CARD domain of VISA upregulated the PEDV-specific IFN-& gamma; level in the serum of vaccinated animals. Notably, vaccination with vC/SM3 & PRIME;UTRN-CARD/tPAsS1NCOE conferred protection against virulent CSFV and PEDV challenge in pigs. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the engineered vC/SM3 & PRIME;UTRN-CARD/tPAsS1NCOE is a promising bivalent vaccine candidate against both CSFV and PEDV infections.

AB  - Simple Summary The difficulty of treating bacterial infections has become a worldwide health concern due to the evolution of bacterial antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics are routinely used to prevent and treat infections in food-producing animals, especially in young animals. This procedure may lead to resistant bacteria in the animal gut that may indirectly cause a broader public health issue. Therefore, we conducted a study in a pig farrow-to-finish operation during five months to understand how the administration of antibiotics in sows and piglets impact the emergence of antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli and its maintenance in the gut until the slaughter weight is reached. Our results showed that sows and their piglets carried antibiotic resistant E. coli throughout their life cycle that can be associated to farm administration of antibiotics. These antibiotics are critical in human medicine, which includes the antibiotic colistin used as a last-resort therapy in some multidrug resistant bacteria in human infections. In addition, these bacteria demonstrated the presence of virulence genes that support pathogenesis. Overall, this study highlights the need to reduce antibiotic use in animal husbandry or to find alternatives to antibiotics in food-animal production to reduce the emergence and potential spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Cephalosporins and polymyxins are employed in antimicrobial protocols to control and treat neonatal infections and post-weaning diarrhoea in swine operations. We conducted a longitudinal study to evaluate the colonization and transmission of antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli in sows and their piglets in a farrow-to-finish operation, focusing on characterization of Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) and mcr genes, virulence traits and genetic relatedness. A total of 293 E. coli isolates were obtained from faecal samples collected in five time points. At birth bla(CTX-M-1group) cluster was detected in E. coli isolates from 9 sows and 49 piglets (73.41%), while in the following four' piglets sampling moments it was detected in 91.8%, 57.6%, 71.4% and 97.4%. The gene mcr-1 was detected in E. coli from one sow and from three piglets from different litters at birth and increased in the first weeks of piglet life (68.85%, 100%, 90% and 8.1%). A new mcr-4 allele, mcr-4.7, was identified in 3.28%, 28.57%, 7.5% of E. coli isolates. Most mcr-positive E. coli isolates (96,7%) carried bla(CTX-M-1Group) genes and 93,33% carried both mcr-4 and mcr-1. CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-32 were the most predominant ESBLs. Plasmids belonged to IncI1, IncF and IncN groups. Most isolates belong to phylogenetic group B1; PAI IV536 marker was detected in nine isolates. The strains were kept in the different stages of the piglets' life. The use of ceftiofur and colistin may explain the high prevalence and co-selection of bla(CTX-M-1Group) and mcr-1 and/or -4 genes, contributing to the maintenance of resistant and virulent isolates throughout the pig life cycle that may reach the food chain.

AB  - This report describes fossils recovered from Ganxian Cave in 2008 and 2018 by the Natural History Museum and Anthropology Museum of Guangxi. The cave sedimentary fill yielded rich mammalian fossils consisting mainly of isolated teeth of medium- to large-sized mammals (Primates, Proboscidea, Perissodactyla, Carnivora, Rodentia, Artiodactyla) of typical 'Ailuropoda-Stegodon' fauna, (e.g. Stegodon orientalis, Ailuropoda baconi, Pongo weidenreichi, Tapirus sinensis, Megatapirus augustus, Crocuta ultima), and more numerous extant species belonging to 28 taxa in total. The biochronological age of the fauna agreed with the age estimates obtained using Uranium-series and coupled ESR/U-series dating. Collectively, these results indicate a Ganxian fossil age range of 168.9 +/- 2.4 ka to 362 +/- 78 ka and establish Ganxian Cave as one of the most precisely dated Middle Pleistocene fossil sites in southern China. Comparison of Ganxian fauna with Pleistocene fossil records of the well-documented faunas of southern China and southeast Asia indicates that the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) probably first appeared in Ganxian Cave. Paleoenvironmental reconstruction-based analysis of the large mammalian fossil assemblage from Ganxian Cave indicates that during the late Middle Pleistocene, the habitat consisted mainly of forests with some open areas and the climate was warm and humid.

AB  - Introduction Moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in an early loss of immature hippocampal granule cells and the activation of typically quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs) in the dentate gyrus. Activation of NSCs leads to a robust increase in proliferation and generation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), supporting restoration of the immature neuron population of over a period of 1-2 weeks. However, it is unclear if neurons born early after injury develop normally, survive long-term and functionally integrate into the hippocampal network. Although adult hippocampal neurogenesis is regulated in a sex-dependent manner, the majority of pre-clinical TBI studies lack the inclusion of both sexes. The goal of this study was to examine sex differences in hippocampal neurogenesis in response to a moderate controlled cortical impact brain injury.Methods In-vivo labeling of NPCs and tracking of their morphological development into a granule cell was achieved using an inducible Cre recombinase driven by the Ascl1 promoter in a CAG-floxStopTom reporter mouse. Ascl1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor transiently expressed in NPCs and activated NSCs in the dentate gyrus of the adult mammalian brain. To specifically label NPCs born acutely after TBI, tamoxifen was delivered to mice on days 2 and 3 postinjury. Mice survived to 6 weeks after TBI to allow for full neuronal maturation of tdTomato-labeled NPCs.Results At 6 weeks postinjury, numbers of tdTomato-positive granule cells were significantly reduced in the ipsilateral hippocampus of brain-injured mice compared to controls, with a more pronounced decrease in males. Further, posttrauma-born neurons in males, but not females, exhibited impaired dendritic development. Neurons born after injury extended axons which formed synaptic terminals within the CA3 region. Numbers of mossy fiber boutons were significantly decreased in injured males compared to na & iuml;ve males or to injured females. Potential forms of plasticity were observed in brain-injured females, including increased neurogenesis in the contralateral hippocampus and increased mossy fiber bouton volume. Together these data suggest a neurogenic advantage in females after injury.Discussion This study is the first to report sex differences in posttraumatic hippocampal neurogenesis and to demonstrate modification of synaptic terminals formed by neurons born after TBI.

AB  - The widespread cultivation of Camellia oleifera in subtropical regions has played a significant role in promoting economic development in southern China. In recent years, the cultivation area has continuously expanded, highlighting the importance of extracting Camellia oleifera plantations automatically and monitoring ecological changes in these regions. This study proposes a novel method based on deep learning, utilizing Sentinel-2 images for efficient assessing ecological quality of Camellia oleifera plantations. First, we undertook a comprehensive examination and assessment of different semantic segmentation models, utilizing a dataset of Camellia oleifera plantations that we compiled. The most effective segmentation model was then employed to automatically extract Camellia oleifera plantations in Shaoyang City. Finally, to gain a deeper understanding of the ecological status of Camellia oleifera plantations, the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) was introduced to analyse ecological changes from 2018 to 2022. The research results indicate that when the U-Net++ model is applied to extract Camellia oleifera plantations from Sentinel-2 images, its performance surpasses other semantic segmentation methods. This method achieves notable metrics: accuracy of 0.80, recall of 0.79, F1-Score of 0.81, and MIoU of 0.88, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying Camellia oleifera plantations. The research findings of Camellia oleifera plantations in Shaoyang City show a notable increase in the mean RSEI, with a rise from 0.166 in 2018 to 0.345 in 2022. Through the application of deep learning for automated Camellia oleifera plantation extraction and RSEI for ecological assessment, the study discovers a continuous expansion of Camellia oleifera plantations and a yearly increase in ecological quality.

AB  - The Chilocorini lady beetles Tenuisvalvae notata (Mulsant) and Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant are important biological control agents being able to share their habitat and compete for their preferred prey, mealybugs. Whereas T. notata is native to South America, C. montrouzieri is an Australian species introduced in Brazil in a biological control program of mealybugs. This work investigated the cannibalism and intraguild predation between these species in the absence of prey. To test for intraguild predation, one individual larva (instars 1-4) from each species was confined for 24 h with another larva of the same instar or the next instar, in a total of 10 combinations. In addition, we measured predation of T. notata adults upon eggs, larvae, pre-pupae and pupa of C. montrouzieri, and vice versa. Cannibalism within the species was also tested across adults, larvae and eggs. Results showed asymmetric interactions in favour of C. montrouzieri, which acted as intraguild predator more than 80% of the time when paired with larvae of T. notata either of the same or different instar. In addition, C. montrouzieri adults preyed more upon larvae and eggs of T. notata than the contrary. There was no intraguild predation upon pre-pupae and pupae. Cannibalism was high upon eggs and first instar larvae of T. notata (89.5% and 65%) and C. montrouzieri (100% and 55%), respectively. Therefore, the exotic C. montrouzieri outcompeted the native T. notata and could become a threat to this endemic species in areas of simultaneous occurrence and under prey scarcity. Thus, the interactions between these lady beetles could affect the success of biological control of mealybugs.

AB  - The need for objective methods to assess child neglect has intensified. However, no biological indicators have been established for this purpose. Recently, early-life environments such as maternal attachment have been shown to affect the activity of long-interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1, L1) in human infants and mouse pups. Herein, we hypothesized that the L1 copy number may correlate with the duration of neglect stress. To test this hypothesis, we employed a well-established mouse model of maternal separation that simulates early-life neglect. C57BL6/J mouse pups were subjected to daily maternal separation for either three or 6 h for two weeks from postnatal day (PND) one. We minimized the potential confounding effects of variations in maternal care by designating half of the littermates as untreated controls. L1 copy number in DNA extracted from the hippocampus and amygdala tissues at PND15 was quantified using real-time PCR with two different genes (5srRNA and Pthlh) as references. The results showed significantly higher L1 copy numbers in the hippocampus of pups separated for 6 h than in untreated controls. In addition, maternal separation duration was found to be correlated with L1 copy number in the hippocampus (r = 0.46, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the amplification of L1 in the hippocampus induced by 6 h of maternal separation was sustained until PND60. This study introduced a novel approach to understanding neglect-related L1 activity and highlighted the potential of L1 elements as an indicator in forensic medicine.

AB  - Introduction The amygdala subnuclei regulate emotional processing and are widely implicated in social cognitive impairments often seen in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Dysregulated amygdala development has been reported in young children with ASD; less is known about amygdala maturation in later adolescence, a sensitive window for social skill development. Methods The macrostructural development of the amygdala subnuclei was assessed at two time points in a longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of adolescents with ASD (n = 23) and typically-developing adolescents (n = 15) . In adolescents with ASD, amygdala subnuclei growth was assessed in relation to ASD symptomatology based on standardized diagnostic assessments. Participants were scanned with MRI at median age of 12 years and returned for a second scan at a median age of 15 years. The volumes of nine amygdala subnuclei were extracted using an automatic segmentation algorithm. Results When examining the longitudinal data acquired across two time points, adolescents with ASD had larger basolateral amygdala (BLA) nuclei volumes compared to typically developing adolescents (B = 46.8, p = 0.04). When examining ASD symptomatology in relation to the growth of the amygdala subnuclei, reciprocal social interaction scores on the ADI-R were positively associated with increased growth of the BLA nuclei (B = 8.3, p < 0.001). Growth in the medial nucleus negatively predicted the communication (B = -46.9, p = 0.02) and social (B = -47.7, p < 0.001) domains on the ADOS-G. Growth in the right cortical nucleus (B = 26.14, p = 0.02) positively predicted ADOS-G social scores. Central nucleus maturation (B = 29.9, p = 0.02) was associated with the repetitive behaviors domain on the ADOS-G. Conclusions Larger BLA volumes in adolescents with ASD may reflect underlying alterations in cellular density previously reported in post-mortem studies. Furthermore, findings demonstrate an association between regional growth in amygdala subnuclei volumes and ASD symptomatology. Improved understanding of the developmental trajectories of the amygdala subnuclei may aid in identifying key windows for interventions, particularly for social communication, in adolescents with ASD.

AB  - The bird louse fly Ornithoctona laticornis (Diptera: Hippoboscidae), previously known only from Africa, has recently been recorded in Europe (Hungary) for the first time, raising questions about its potential range expansion. In this study, we document the first record of O. laticornis from the Syrian Woodpecker (Dendrocopos syriacus) in 2022 and another from the Great Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopos major) in 2023, both in Romania. Morphological description and molecular analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene confirmed the species identity. The main morphological criteria for the identification of O. laticornis were used in the updated key for the European genera of Hippoboscidae. The recurring presence of O. laticornis in resident European birds suggests either overwintering survival or multiple introductions via migratory hosts. Given the ability of hippoboscid flies to act as vectors of pathogens, this discovery underscores the importance of continued surveillance of avian ectoparasites in Europe. Further studies are needed to assess the distribution of the species, its genetic diversity, host range, and its potential role as a vector.

T2  - BIOINORGANIC CHEMISTRY AND APPLICATIONS
LA  - English
KW  - THERAPY
AB  - Camel milk is better tolerated than the milk of other ruminants, potentially expanding its consumer appeal. It also contains essential vitamins, minerals, and immunoglobulins, providing the milk with antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. These properties may reduce oxidative stress in camel milk consumers, ameliorating many conditions, including those of the CNS, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which camel milk administration (boiled or raw) was examined as an ASD treatment intervention. The primary endpoint was participants' total autism scores, determined using the Childhood Autistic Responsiveness Scale (CARS). A comparison of the responsiveness in these ASD intervention groups yielded a mean difference (MD) of 1.99 (0.89, 3.08) in those consuming boiled camel milk, MD = 2.77 (1.92, 3.61) in raw camel milk consumers, and MD = -1.02 (-0.10, 2.13) in cow milk consumers. Heterogeneity was notably low among the examined studies. Treatment of ASD with raw and boiled camel milk resulted in significantly lower CARS scores than the placebo. Our findings support the development of larger, more populated RCTs to establish camel milk's overall potential as a therapeutic intervention for CNS disorders.

AB  - Simple Summary 3D models are increasingly popular in veterinary teaching. However, students struggle with transferring 2D textbook images to 3D anatomical structures. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the learning outcome of 3D scans and 2D images of horse and pig skulls. Furthermore, the relationship between spatial ability and learning outcome was analyzed when using the different learning materials. Second-year veterinary medicine students participated in a practical anatomy course using 3D scans or 2D images as learning material and performed a test to determine their spatial ability. Independently of the learning material, all groups displayed high learning outcomes with no significant differences between the groups. In addition, it could not be stated that 3D scans support students with lower spatial ability. Nevertheless, students preferred 3D scans, finding them more motivating, although they did not necessarily improve learning outcomes.Abstract Students often struggle with interpreting traditional textbook images and translating them to anatomical structures. This study aimed to compare the impact of 3D scans versus 2D images on students' learning outcomes when learning anatomical structures on skulls from horses and pigs. Furthermore, the correlation between spatial ability and learning outcomes using 3D scans or 2D images was examined. Second-year veterinary medicine students either used 3D scans or 2D images, annotated with arrows or numbers as learning material. Students' anatomical knowledge was tested before and after the learning session, and spatial ability was assessed using the mental rotation test. All groups improved significantly in the post-test. However, the differences between groups were not significant, suggesting that 3D scans do not necessarily lead to higher learning outcomes. The analysis of the correlation between spatial ability and learning outcomes did not prove that students with weaker spatial ability benefit from 3D scans. Students preferred 3D scans over 2D images despite similar outcomes, suggesting they are valuable for learning. However, results show that the introduction of novel learning materials likely amplified the impact of reduced learning time on the 3D group, as these materials necessitated additional time for effective comprehension and integration.

AB  - Introduction Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) provide a unique model for studying cloning in large mammals. As an endangered species with declining populations and limited oocyte availability, interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) combined with transcriptomic analysis holds promise for advancing iSCNT embryonic arrest development and further facilitating applications in conservation efforts, therapeutic cloning, and regenerative medicine.Methods This study conducted low-input RNA sequencing analyses on transgenic Asian elephant-pig (AE-P) inter-order cloned embryos expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at the 2- and 4-cell stages. Differential gene expressions, pathway enrichment, and hub gene analyses were performed to identify the molecular mechanisms and core genes influencing normal and arrest development.Results and Discussion Approximately 25% of clean reads successfully aligned with the Asian elephant genome. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that inter-order cloned embryos with earlier cleavage at the 2- and 4-cell stages exhibited signs of residual transcriptomic memory and incomplete epigenetic reprogramming, while arrested embryos showed indications of nucleocytoplasmic incompatibility and nDNA-mtDNA mismatch. Hub gene analyses indicated core genes such as NDUFC2, NDUFS3, NDUFAB1, SDHC, SDHB, NUP54, NUP43, NUP37, NDC1, CDK1, and CCNB1 linked to energy production, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and cell cycle regulation highlighting the overall challenges in cloning Asian elephant inter-order embryos. Altogether, the analysis of high-throughput sequencing enhances the reliability of iSCNT production in this study, advancing our understanding of cellular reprogramming and molecular roadblocks in AE-P inter-order cloned embryos. Transcriptomic analyses have identified key factors contributing to developmental barriers in iSCNT, offering valuable insights into the complexities of these challenges.

AB  - Introduction This study mainly investigated the role of miR-199a-5p in depression. Methods qRT-PCR and western blotting were employed to detect the expressions of miR-199a-5p, CREB and BDNF. Sucrose preference test, forced swimming test, and tail suspension test were performed to evaluate depression-related symptoms. MTT assays and flow cytometry were used to examine the cell reproduction and apoptotic cells of hippocampal neuron. Results The data demonstrated that the expression levels of miR-199a-5p in the cerebrospinal fluids and serums of depression patient and the hippocampus of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse were significantly increased. However, the expressions of WNT2, p-CREB, and BDNF were inhibited. In addition, miR-199a-5p-inhibitor enhanced sucrose preferences of CUMS mouse and decreased immobile time in sucrose preference test and forced swimming test. Knockdown of WNT2 attenuated the effects of miR-199a-5p-inhibitor on cell reproduction and apoptotic cells of hippocampal neuron and the expression of WNT2, p-CREB, and BDNF. Conclusion MiR-199a-5p can target WNT2 to enhance the development of depression through regulation of the CREB/BDNF signaling. Trial registration: JNU-Hos-49284.

AB  - Colombian creole breeds Blanco Orejinegro (BON) and Sanmartinero (SM) are widely used as pure breeds and in crossbreeding programs due to their excellent performance in the double ability of milk and meat production. We examined genomic regions and genes that from generation to generation have been selected by positive natural selection in favor of the adaptability and reproductive performance of these two Colombian creole breeds. Natural selection of genomics region and genes is one of the main evolutive changes resulting in phenotypic adaptations. The selected genomic regions can be detected by comparing differences in regional linkage disequilibrium (LD) between cattle populations with potential adaptations for economic traits. In this study, we used 58,868 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from BON and 57482 SNPs from SM, using genotyping data from 1262 BON and 742 SM animals to estimate the variation of genome-wide LD between populations using the VARLD program. The top 0.1 and 0.01th percentiles of standardized VarLD scores were used as a criterion for all comparisons. A total of 10 selection signatures on chromosomes 3, 5, 11, 15, 18, 21, 22, 23, 25 and 29 were identified in all populations. These signatures overlapped with quantitative trait loci for adaptability and reproductive performance in both breeds. Within the signature located between 23,903,882 and 23,955,588 bp on chromosome 18, we identified the SLC6A2 gene involved in the response to high stress. Also, we identified the genes CTDSP2, CES1, CFAP161, CLEC14A, HIPK1, RBM4, SSTR involved in the expressions of economic traits (meat and milk production), KDMID, OLFML3 genes involved in reproductive traits (age at first calving and calving interval), and ATP23, LRRTM1, SLC6A2, DEK, SYT6, KDMID genes involved in cellular stress response and response to important environmental changes such as high temperature. We conclude that these genomic regions seem to point toward a recent selection in BON and SM populations. These regions can be used in selection and conservation programs.

AB  - Introduction: The mechanical obstruction and pulmonary vasoconstriction are major determinants of the sudden right ventricular (RV) afterload increases observed during acute pulmonary thromboembolism (APT). Vasodilators and antioxidants agents have been shown to mitigate pulmonary hypertension. We examined whether sodium nitrite and the antioxidant tempol combination could be advantageous in an APT sheep model. Methods: APT was induced in anesthetized sheep by autologous blood clots (250 mg/kg) into the right atrium. Thirty minutes after APT induction, the animals received a continuous infusion of tempol (1.0 mg/kg/min), increasing sodium nitrite infusion (5, 15, and 50 mu mol/kg), or a simultaneous combination of both drugs. Saline was used as a control treatment. Hemodynamic measurements were carried out every 15 min. Also, whole blood nitrite and serum 8-isoprostanes levels were measured. Results: APT induced sustained pulmonary hypertension, increased dp/dtmax, and rate pressure product (RPP). Nitrite or tempol treatments attenuated these increases (P < 0.05). When both drugs were combined, we found a robust reduction in the RV RPP compared with the treatments alone (P < 0.05). The sole nitrite infusion increased blood nitrite concentrations by 35 +/- 6 mu M (P < 0.05), whereas the nitrite and tempol combination produced higher blood nitrite concentrations by approximately 54 +/- 7 mu M. Tempol or nitrite infusions, both alone or combined, blunted the increases in 8-isoprostane concentrations observed after APT. Conclusions: Nitrite and tempol combination protects against APT-induced RV wall stress. The association of both drugs may offer an advantage to treat RV failure during severe APT.

AB  - Wildlife food provisioning may benefit tourism as it can increase sightings of cryptic species, bringing economic returns to local communities. However, food-conditioned animals can become dangerous, resulting in the injury and death of wildlife, people or both. These negative impacts counteract potential benefits. Here, we examine the observed and potential impacts of food provisioning on wild Asian elephants by tourists to evaluate whether it can become a regulated activity. We present observations of wild Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Udawalawe National Park (UNP) Sri Lanka, between 2007 and 2024 and the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (NBR) in southern India between 2007 and 2022, documenting negative outcomes of food-provisioning by tourists. We also describe a successful de-habituation effort for one elephant in the NBR. At UNP, 66 male elephants (9%-15% of the estimated male population) were observed seeking food from people at a boundary electric fence. Fourteen were seen at the fence in 11 or more years, and 52 were seen in 8 or fewer years. There were significant positive correlations between the tendency to be seen at the fence and the overall number of sightings per individual across years. Fatalities of at least three elephants and one person occurred near the fence. At NBR, 11 males were food habituated by tourists out of which four died through anthropogenic causes. We describe behavioural changes across years by one male at UNP and one male at NBR. Practical implications. Considering the possible social transmission of problematic behaviours, there is an urgent need to curb them before they spread among wild animal populations. We maintain that food provisioning of wild elephants by tourists cannot be a regulated activity and bans must be strictly enforced. In the long term, working with local stakeholders to educate tourists and habitat restoration are needed to discourage food provisioning by people and food seeking by elephants.

AB  - Introduction Plants containing aristolochic acid and its derivatives are nephrotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic to humans; chronic diet poisoning caused by the aristolochic acid is the cause of endemic (Balkan) nephropathy and related cancers. Objective To develop a colloidal gold immunochromatographic test strip (ICS) based on the competitive format for the rapid detection of aristolochic acid A (AA-A) in herbal medicinal materials. Materials and methods For the ICS based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), the antigen [AA-A-bovine serum albumin (BSA)], and goat anti-mouse IgG were drawn on the nitrocellulose membrane as the test line (T line) and the control line (C line), respectively. Monoclonal antibody (MAb)-AuNP conjugates were sprayed onto the conjugate pad. The sensitivity of the ICS was 6 ng/mL, and the test was completed in 10 min. The analysis of AA-A in traditional Chinese medicine samples showed that the ICS results were in good agreement with those obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography methods. Conclusion These results demonstrated that the ICS test could be used as a reliable, rapid, cost-effective, and convenient qualitative tool for on-site screening techniques to detect AA-A in herbal medicinal materials without any special instrumentation.

AB  - Pseudorabies is an acute, highly contagious infectious disease caused by the pseudorabies virus (PRV). Since 2011, several pathogenic mutant strains of PRV have emerged, and the efficacy of existing vaccines has been inadequate in providing full protection, leading to considerable economic losses in the pig industry. Cistanche deserticola polysaccharides (CDP) exhibits a range of biological activities. However, its antiviral effects remain under-explored. In this study, we demonstrated that CDP possesses antiviral activities against PRV/XJ5, notably, at the concentration of 1000 mu g/mL, the inhibitory rate of PRV-infected PK15 B6 cells attained about 90 %. CDP inhibited the adsorption, entry, and replication of PRV/XJ5 in PK15 B6 cells in a dose-dependent manner when introduced at various stages of the viral life cycle. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were observed to reduce by almost 50 % at the highest recorded concentration. While simultaneously enhancing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, thereby mitigating oxidative stress induced by PRV/XJ5. Additionally, high dose of CDP (200 mg/kg) was found to offer complete protection against PRV in mouse model when the mice were inoculated with lethal doses of PRV via nasal drops. These results suggested that CDP may serve as promising antiviral agent for the prevention and management of PRV variant infections.

AB  - Construction using timber has seen a resurgence in light of global climate mitigation policies. Wood is a renewable resource, and engineered wood products are proving to be competitive against concrete and steel while having several advantages. However, while the renewable nature of wood in construction is a beneficial property for climate mitigation policies, the process of biodegradation introduces a challenge for service life planning. A review of hazard mapping is presented while developing contemporary hazard maps, occurrence maps and projected hazard maps for 2050 using representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5. The risk of timber decay is expected to increase in most of Europe as the temperatures rise, with a decrease expected in dryer regions. Termites are likely to experience a range expansion as more areas become suitable, while human activity and an increase in extreme weather events like floods are expected to facilitate dispersion. Marine borer species already present a risk in most European coastal regions; however, the effect of changes in water temperatures are likely to shift the boundaries for individual borer species. Overall, warmer climates are expected to increase the metabolic activity of all of these organisms leading to a general reduction in service life.

AB  - Stick and leaf insects (Phasmatodea) are a moderately diverse order that comprises almost 3,500 extant species of large to very large often impressively camouflaged nocturnal herbivores. The order also stands out as one of the few insect orders that have until lately lacked a robust higher-level phylogeny and still the relationships between many New World taxa in particular remain unknown.The Diapheromerinae is one of the main lineages of the Occidophasmata and comprises a bulk of the diversity of New World stick insects. The clade is endemic to the Americas and includes the longest insects of that region. During the past 25 years Diapheromerinae has experienced various often inconsistent attempts of a classification, which have resulted in a complicated history that has meanwhile constituted a heterogenous mixture of historical and contemporary views. To counter these challenges workers have made use of rank-free taxa to provisionally group supposedly monophyletic clades. Currently the Diapheromerinae are sub-divided into the two tribes Diapheromerini and Oreophoetini and recent molecular analyses have shown taxa of the Cladomorphinae G & uuml;nther, 1953 to belong to Diapheromerinae. Certainly, the clade still deserves much work to delimit meaningful sub-groups within Diapheromerinae reflective of their evolutionary history and the results of the latest comprehensive molecular-based phylogenetic studies already imply sub-divisions within the Diapheromerini. The rank-free taxon Cladomorformia tax. n. is established to comprise former Cladomorphini, Cranidiini, Otocrania Redtenbacher, 1908 as well as sections of Diapheromerini sensu Robertson et al., 2018, which are the genera that have previously been placed in the "Phanocles group" sensu Zompro, 2001 as well as two genera of the "Bacteria group" and one genus of the "Clonistria group": Alienobostra, Bostriana, Calynda, Globocalynda, Laciphorus, Phanocles, Phanocloidea and Trychopeplus. The genus Cranidium and all genera of Cladomorphini sensu Hennemann et al., 2016 are here formally transferred to Diapheromerinae, this is Aplopocranidium, Cladomorphus, Jeremia, Jeremiodes, Otocraniella and Xylodus. A holistic review of Cladomorformia at the genus level is conducted herein and new diagnoses, differentiations and keys to all 25 genera that are now contained in that clade are presented. Lists of species are provided for all genera, which include detailed type data, synonymies and distributional records. Moreover, identification keys to all 163 known valid species are provided to render identification of species within the 25 known genera possible. In total, 232 species are covered if the 69 synonymous taxa are included.The subfamily Haplopodinae is introduced to comprise all genera of the tribes Haplopodini, Hesperophasmatini and Pterinoxylini as classified by Hennemann et al. (2016) as well as the recently described Teruelphasmini. Renaming former Cladomorphinae sensu Robertson et al. (2018) into Haplopodinae is necessary, because the type-genus Cladomorphuscan no longer be considered a member of that lineage and belongs in Diapheromerinae. Haplopodinae is the only New World clade that belongs into the Old World Oriophasmata.Bostranova Villet, 2023 has been introduced to replace the preoccupied Bostra St & aring;l, 1875. The type-species of Bostranova, Bacteria turgida Westwood, 1859, however is here shown to belong in Phanocloidea Zompro, 2001. Thus, Bostranova is synonymised under Phanocloidea (n. syn.) and all species are transferred to Phanocloidea and other genera.
   Paraphanocles Zompro, 2001 (Type-species: Mantis keratosqueleton Olivier, 1792) is synonymised with Phanocles St & aring;l, 1875 (syn. n.).Seven new genera are described: Globocraniagen. n. (Type-species: Bacteria emesa Westwood, 1859), Hirtuleiodesgen. n. (Type-species: Phibalosoma gibbosa Chopard, 1911), Lanceobostragen. n. (Type-species: Bacteria aetolusWestwood, 1859), Ocreatophasmagen. n. (Type-species: Ocreatophasma eleganssp. n.), Parotocraniagen. n. (Type-species: Parotocrania panamaesp. n.), Phanoclocraniagen. n. (Type-species: Bostra dorsuaria St & aring;l, 1875) and Spinocloideagen. n. (Type-species: Spinocloidea panamaense sp. n.). All seven genera are described from both sexes and the eggs, with the exception of Ocreatophasmagen. n., which is known from the females only.Forty-one new species are described: Globocalynda cornutasp. n. from Ecuador, Globocalynda marcapataesp. n.from Peru, Globocalynda ruficollissp. n. from Bolivia, Hirtuleiodes peruanussp. n. from Peru, Jeremiodes costaricensissp. n. from Costa Rica, Jeremiodes ecuadoricussp. n. from Ecuador, Jeremiodes peruanussp. n. from Peru, Lanceobostra chapalaensesp. n. from Mexico, Lanceobostra glabrasp. n. from Mexico, Lanceobostra oaxacaeesp. n. from Mexico, Lanceobostra ornatasp. n. from Mexico, Lanceobostra torquatasp. n. from Mexico, Lanceobostra tuckeraesp. n. from Mexico, Ocreatophasma elegansgen. n.,sp. n. from Peru, Ocreatophasma fragilegen. n.,sp. n. from Peru, Ocreatophasma modestumgen. n.,sp. n. from Peru, Parotocrania acutilobatagen. n.,sp. n. from Ecuador, Parotocrania curvatagen. n.,sp. n. from Peru, Parotocrania panamaegen. n.,sp. n. from Panama, Phanocles acutecornutussp. n. from Ecuador, Phanocles barbadosensesp. n. from Barbados, Phanocles berezinisp. n. from Mexico, Phanocles brevipessp. n. from Peru, Phanocles chiapasensesp. n. from Mexico, Phanocles cuzcoensesp. n. from Peru, Phanocles ecuadoricussp. n. from Ecuador, Phanocles falcatussp. n. from Ecuador, Phanocles maximus sp. n. from Panama, Phanocles mexicanus sp. n. from Mexico, Phanocles pleurospinosussp. n. from Costa Rica, Phanocles rehni sp. n. from Honduras, Phanocles solidussp. n. from Ecuador, Phanocles spectabilissp. n. from Costa Rica, Phanocles superbussp. n. from Ecuador, Phanocloidea sanguinea sp. n. from Ecuador, Phanocloidea semipterasp. n. from Venezuela, Phanocloidea venezuelicasp. n. from Venezuela, Spinocloidea panamaensegen. n.,sp. n. from Panama, Spinocloidea splendidagen. n.,sp. n.from Colombia and Spinocloidea tumescensgen. n.,sp. n. from Costa Rica. With a maximum recorded body length of 285.0 mm the new species Phanocles maximussp. n. from Panama is the longest extant insect of the Americas and the Occidophasmata clade. A total of 132 taxonomic changes are conducted: 64 species are transferred to other genera and 43 new synonyms are established. Lectotypes are designated for 25 taxa to ensure stability of the concerned names or new synonymies here established. Moreover, the previously unknown females of five and males of twelve species are described and illustrated for the first time. Colour illustrations are presented of the eggs of 39 species, of which those of 26 species are formally described and illustrated for the first time:

AB  - Rett syndrome (RTT) is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1:10000 newborn girls and is primarily caused by mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2. Due to reduced brain monoamine levels in RTT, antidepressants have been explored as potential therapies. In previous studies, we demonstrated that the antidepressant mirtazapine (MTZ) alleviates symptoms in Mecp2-mutant mice and RTT adult patients. However, the mechanism of action of MTZ, a racemic mixture that binds to multiple receptors, remains unclear. This study introduces a computational approach to screen the "human pocketome," comprising over 25 K ligand-bound pockets derived from more than 210 K human protein structures available in the RCSB Protein Data Bank, aiming to identify binding pockets with high affinity for each MTZ enantiomer. Novelty concerns the approach to compare the two enantiomers of MTZ to other drugs experimentally determined as inactive for RTT. This approach introduces a new metric, the ZZscore, which ranks tested proteins and pockets based on their degree of interaction with the tested drugs. This enables the identification of potential drug-protein interactions relevant to the disease and/or phenotypic traits under study. Initial relaxed settings and thresholds parameters suggested over 30 potential targets, among which the RASH/SOS1 complex, but in vitro experiments on cultured hippocampal neurons from Mecp2-KO mice excluded any MTZ effect on it. Thus, we refined the procedure with more stringent parameters and identified 16 protein targets for S(+)MTZ and 14 for R(-)MTZ, with 5 common targets. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed 25 pathways for S(+)MTZ and 24 for R(-)MTZ, with 11 common pathways, many related to MeCP2 functions disrupted in RTT, such as epigenetic chromatin regulation, intracellular signaling, energy metabolism, cholesterol and lipid metabolism, and catecholamine biosynthesis. Overall, the presented computational modeling strategy for target identification allowed us to hypothesize new mechanisms of action for the two MTZ enantiomers. image

AB  - Gene-edited animals are crucial for addressing fundamental questions in biology and medicine and hold promise for practical applications. In light of the rapid advancement of gene editing technologies over the past decade, a dramatically increased number of gene-edited animals have been generated. Genome editing at off-target sites can, however, introduce genomic variations, potentially leading to unintended functional consequences in these animals. So, there is an urgent need to systematically collect and collate these variations in gene-edited animals to aid data mining and integrative in-depth analyses. However, existing databases are currently insufficient to meet this need. Here, we present the Variation Database of Gene-Edited animals (VDGE, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/vdge), the first open-access repository to present genomic variations and annotations in gene-edited animals, with a particular focus on larger animals such as monkeys. At present, VDGE houses 151 on-target mutations from 210 samples, and 115,710 variations identified from 107 gene-edited and wild-type animal trios through unified and standardized analysis and concurrently provides comprehensive annotation details for each variation, thus facilitating the assessment of their functional consequences and promoting mechanistic studies and practical applications for gene-edited animals.

AB  - Aim. To analyze the diversity of bat viruses in Russia and neighboring countries. To identify the main vectors of these pathogens and possible ways of introduction into the territory of the Russian Federation. In Russia the RNA sequences of 36 Coronaviridae, 8 Rhabdoviridae and 3 Astroviridae have been obtained from bats. In neighboring countries, RNA/DNA sequences of viruses in bats have been found in Norway (2), Finland 14), Poland 42), Ukraine (8), Georgia (46), Kazakhstan (29), China (5.645) and Japan (109). The dsequences which have been discovered belong to 30 families (Table 1). An increase in the number of sequences obtained over the past year has been observed in Russia and China. The absolute majority of sequences belong to the Coronaviridae family (62.96 %). The available data on bat viruses in Russia indicate the need to develop and implement a state interdisciplinary programme dedicated to this problem. The greatest danger is posed by Rhabdoviridae: mortalities after infection have been recorded in Russia. The data obtained also indicate that the main vectors of viruses are representatives of the genera Eptesicus, Myotis, Nyctalus, Rhinolophus and Vespertilio. The risk of virus exchange and transmission is most likely to be between the western part of Russia and European countries.

AB  - Non-indigenous bryozoans are frequent components of biofouling assemblages in harbour environments worldwide. We performed a survey of artificial hard substrates in six harbours spanning 16 degrees of latitude along the coast of Argentina, from Ingeniero White (38 degrees 47 ' S) to Ushuaia (54 degrees 48 ' S). Microeciella argentina n. sp., distributed in warm-temperate waters of northern Patagonia and Buenos Aires Province, is described. The non-indigenous species (NIS) Callopora dumerilii, Smittoidea spinigera and Stephanollona boreopacifica are recorded here for the first time in the Southwest Atlantic. Their occurrence in fouling assemblages of warm-temperate harbours and their previous absence in these areas suggest that they probably arrived in Argentina by international shipping traffic. Callopora dumerilii is native to Europe and the northeast Atlantic. Smittoidea spinigera and Stephanollona boreopacifica are native to China and Korea, respectively. The morphological differences between S. spinigera and the Californian species S. prolifera, which is invading European harbours in the North Sea, are discussed. Bugula neritina, Bugulina flabellata, Cryptosula pallasiana and Fenestrulina delicia, common in harbours of Buenos Aires Province, are here recorded in Patagonia, highlighting the importance of regional shipping traffic to secondary spread of NIS. Arachnidium fibrosum, Buskia socialis, Anguinella palmata, Aetea cultrata, Bicellariella edentata and Exochella moyanoi, previously known from Brazil, and Hippothoa divaricata, are here recorded in Argentina. This study shows that warm-temperate harbours in Buenos Aires Province and northern Patagonia are particularly prone to the introduction of non-indigenous bryozoans.

AB  - The study is devoted to the effect of lowered resuscitation temperature (26 degrees C) on cryopreserved porcine adrenal glands functional activity in vitro and in vivo under xenotransplantation. The adrenals were collected from newborn pigs, cryopreserved with 5 % DMSO at a rate of 1 degrees C/min, resuscitated at 26 or 37 degrees C for 48 h (5 % CO2, DMEM), embedded into small intestinal submucosa, and transplanted to bilaterally adrenalectomized rats. It has been shown that the glands resuscitated at 26 degrees C have suppressed free-radical processes and can produce cortisol and aldosterone in vitro, and may lead to elevated blood levels of these hormones. Moreover, the adrenal grafts maintain blood glucose levels and promote the formation of glycogen stores. Thus, the resuscitation at 26 degrees C can improve the quality of grafts and favor the introduction and application of the cryopreserved organs and tissues for transplantation in clinical and experimental practice.

   An Elephant trunk shape (ETS) radiating element is used to achieve the two covering bands of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) antenna. These frequency bands can be controlled by the length of a slot embedded in ETS. The slot length in ETS plays a defining role in controlling the impedance bandwidth (IBW) of the MIMO antenna, and its diligent adjustment of it leads to cover the frequency range of Bluetooth and Wireless Local Area Network systems.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A new MIMO antenna is introduced in this paper in conjunction with an enhanced Wilkinson power divider feeding platform.
   Findings
   These frequency bands can be controlled by the length of a slot embedded in ETS. The slot length in ETS plays a defining role in controlling the IBW of the MIMO antenna, and its diligent adjustment leads to covering the frequency range of Bluetooth and WLAN systems.
   Originality/value
   The proposed MIMO antenna benefits from good isolation between ports for both frequency bands. The proposed MIMO antenna is constructed on FR4 substrate with a volume of 90 x 134 x 1.6 mm3.

AB  - Background Adverse events induced by drug-drug interactions are a major concern in the United States. Current research is moving toward using electronic health record (EHR) data, including for adverse drug events discovery. One of the first steps in EHR-based studies is to define a phenotype for establishing a cohort of patients. However, phenotype definitions are not readily available for all phenotypes. One of the first steps of developing automated text mining tools is building a corpus. Therefore, this study aimed to develop annotation guidelines and a gold standard corpus to facilitate building future automated approaches for mining phenotype definitions contained in the literature. Furthermore, our aim is to improve the understanding of how these published phenotype definitions are presented in the literature and how we annotate them for future text mining tasks. Results Two annotators manually annotated the corpus on a sentence-level for the presence of evidence for phenotype definitions. Three major categories (inclusion, intermediate, and exclusion) with a total of ten dimensions were proposed characterizing major contextual patterns and cues for presenting phenotype definitions in published literature. The developed annotation guidelines were used to annotate the corpus that contained 3971 sentences: 1923 out of 3971 (48.4%) for the inclusion category, 1851 out of 3971 (46.6%) for the intermediate category, and 2273 out of 3971 (57.2%) for exclusion category. The highest number of annotated sentences was 1449 out of 3971 (36.5%) for the "Biomedical & Procedure" dimension. The lowest number of annotated sentences was 49 out of 3971 (1.2%) for "The use of NLP". The overall percent inter-annotator agreement was 97.8%. Percent and Kappa statistics also showed high inter-annotator agreement across all dimensions. Conclusions The corpus and annotation guidelines can serve as a foundational informatics approach for annotating and mining phenotype definitions in literature, and can be used later for text mining applications.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Detarium microcarpum Guill. & Perr. is used traditionally in Far North Cameroun to treat stomach aches, anxiety, epilepsy, and other mental disorders. Aim of the study: Evaluate the anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects of D. microcarpum (DM) in unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) model of depression in male rats and its impact on fecal enterobacteria of stressed rats. Materials and methods: Rats were handled daily (control) or subjected to the UCMS procedure for 42 days. Anxiety-like behaviors were assessed using the light and dark box test (LBD) and the open field test (OFT). Depressive-like behaviors were assessed using the forced swimming test (FST), the sucrose preference test (SPT), and the novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT). Feces were then collected, followed by blood, brain, and duodenum sections after sacrifice. Monoamine levels, pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress factors, and nitrosative stress were assessed. Feces were introduced into Hectoen enteric agar for the identification of enterobacteria. An in vitro growth test was performed. Results: The DM ethanolic extract has significantly increased the time spent in the light box, in the LBD, and in the center area of the OFT. Moreover, the extract has significantly reduced the preference for sucrose in the SPT, the time of immobility in the FST, and the latency period to consume the pet in the NSFT. DM extract has significantly reduced serum cortisol levels. It also significantly decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and Il1 beta in both brain and duodenum homogenate. DM has increased the brain's serotonin, GABA, and dopamine levels. The DM extract also decreased the MDA and nitrite levels. It also increased the SOD and CAT activities in both brain and duodenal homogenate. Histologically, the DM extract restored the cell's density in hippocampi sections and prevented gut inflammation and peroxidation characterizing leaky gut syndrome. DM extract has no effect on the growth of enterobacteria species isolated in vitro. Conclusion: The ethanolic extract of DM would have anxiolytic and antidepressant effects via the modulation of the HPA axis, brain antioxidant enzyme activities, inflammation, and nitrosative stress. Moreover, it could act by preventing leaky gut syndrome.

AB  - Urinary incontinence (UI) is a prevalent condition that adversely affects quality of life, driving the need for innovative technologies for continuous bladder monitoring. In this study, we introduce a wrinkled metal (platinum and gold) strain sensor tailored for real-time bladder volume monitoring. This stretchable sensor is designed to provide robust and reliable performance for 5000 cycles with minimal hysteresis, and its mechanical properties match that of bladder tissue, enabling accurate monitoring during bladder filling and emptying. Our experimental results demonstrate that the sensor offers high sensitivity and stability, with a dynamic range of up to 230% strain, Young's modulus of 11.7-32 kPa, and a gauge factor (GF) of 2.9-4.7. The sensor's efficacy was validated through in vitro bladder phantom studies and ex vivo pig bladder experiments, where it consistently tracked bladder volume changes with a sensitivity of 4.60 mL-1. The results suggest that the strain sensor is a promising candidate for robust, biocompatible bladder volume monitoring in patients with urinary disorders, offering an alternative to traditional methods by being more comfortable and biocompatible.

AB  - Introduction Recent advances in computational neuroscience highlight the significance of prefrontal cortical meta-control mechanisms in facilitating flexible and adaptive human behavior. In addition, hippocampal function, particularly mental simulation capacity, proves essential in this adaptive process. Rooted from these neuroscientific insights, we present Meta-Dyna, a novel neuroscience-inspired reinforcement learning architecture that demonstrates rapid adaptation to environmental dynamics whilst managing variable goal states and state-transition uncertainties.Methods This architectural framework implements prefrontal meta-control mechanisms integrated with hippocampal replay function, which in turn optimized task performance with limited experiences. We evaluated this approach through comprehensive experimental simulations across three distinct paradigms: the two-stage Markov decision task, which frequently serves in human learning and decision-making research; stochastic GridWorldLoCA, an established benchmark suite for model-based reinforcement learning; and a stochastic Atari Pong variant incorporating multiple goals under uncertainty.Results Experimental results demonstrate Meta-Dyna's superior performance compared with baseline reinforcement learning algorithms across multiple metrics: average reward, choice optimality, and a number of trials for success.Discussions These findings advance our understanding of computational reinforcement learning whilst contributing to the development of brain-inspired learning agents capable of flexible, goal-directed behavior within dynamic environments.

AB  - Introduction 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13(S)-HODE) is a bioactive lipid derived from linoleic acid, it plays prominent roles in cellular processes such as lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Follicular atresia is a complex physiological process involving multiple forms of cell death. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death, has been less studied in the context of follicular atresia.Methods To investigate the association between ovine follicular atresia and ferroptosis, we performed transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of healthy and atretic sheep follicles. Notably, sheep follicular granulosa cells were treated with different doses of 13(S)-HODE. Cell viability, lipid peroxidation levels, ferroptosis-related markers, and ferroptosis-related genes were measured.Results The metabolomic analysis identified 87 and 48 differentially expressed metabolites in healthy and atretic follicles, respectively. Functional enrichment of atretic follicle fluid highlighted pathways related to linoleic acid and purine metabolism. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 250 highly expressed genes in ovarian granulosa cells of atretic follicles. Enrichment analysis indicated that these differentially expressed genes were associated with fatty acid metabolism and ferroptosis. Integration of multi-omics data demonstrated the occurrence of ferroptosis in atretic follicles, where 13(S)-HODE drives granulosa cell ferroptosis via the linoleic acid metabolism pathway; this effect was not dose-dependent. Mechanistic studies showed that low-dose 13(S)-HODE counteracts ferroptosis by promoting glutathione peroxidase 4-mediated lipid peroxidation reduction and increasing glutathione levels.Discussion In contrast, high-dose 13(S)-HODE induces labile iron accumulation through activation of transferrin receptor and ferritin heavy chain 1, enhancing ferroptosis sensitivity in granulosa cells. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating follicle development and offer potential therapeutic targets for enhanced follicular development and improved reproductive outcomes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the use of green solvents, natural deep eutectic solvents (NaDES), in comparison with conventional solvents on the extraction of free unbound phenolic compounds and the antioxidant activity of extracts of dried bilberry fruit, bilberry leaves and green tea leaves. After preparation of the extracts via ultrasound-assisted extraction using NaDES and conventional solvents (water and ethanol), spectrophotometric determination of total phenolic and flavonoid content, HPLC analysis of extracted polyphenols and antioxidant determination using FRAP, DPPH and ABTS assays were conducted. The results showed that NaDES have a great potential as agents for the extraction of phenolic compounds with potent antioxidant activity; the highest values of phenolic content and antioxidant activity were detected in the samples obtained by extraction using the NaDES combination betaine + urea. The bilberry leaves exhibited the highest flavonoid content among all extracts and turned out to be more active than bilberry fruits, to which they are often just a by-product during processing. The most active extract of all was the betaine-urea green tea leaves extract. Further research into the most active NaDES extracts should be performed.

AB  - Cytosine base editors (CBEs) and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR method both have the ability to introduce nucleotide substitution into genomes, which exhibit great potential for improving economically important traits in livestock species. The FecG(H) mutation (g. C1184T, p. S395F) of growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) gene increases prolificacy in Cambridge sheep and Belclare sheep. In the present study, we aimed to compare the efficiency and precision of BE4-Gam and CRISPR/Cas9 systems on generating FecG(H) mutation in ovine genome. First, the microinjection of BE4-Gam mRNA had no adverse effects on development rate after cleavage, and the efficiencies of total mutants and targeted mutants were 8.9% and 7.1%, respectively. Then, the total mutation and targeted mutation rates were improved from 8.5% to 22.5% (p < .01), and 6.4% to 16.3%, respectively, by adjusting the injection time of BE4-Gam mRNA from 14 to 12 hr post-insemination (hpi). Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR method introduced the FecG(H) mutation at the efficiency of 16.1%, which was comparable to BE4-Gam system (16.3%). There was no bystander editing event happened in edited embryos caused by CRISPR/Cas9, but the bystander editing efficiency was as high as 15.0% in BE4-Gam-edited embryos. In summary, our findings demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR method was more accurate than BE4-Gam system in introducing FecG(H) into ovine genome, and highlight the potential of the former strategy to modify economically important trait-associated SNPs.

AB  - In North Africa, Tetranychus urticae Koch, 1836 represents one of the most destructive generalists among mite herbivores. Unfortunately, it is a source of important annual casualties in crop production. It is a phytophagous mite that can feed on hundreds of host plants and produces significant damage. The control of T. urticae in North Africa has been principally based on acaricide sprays. However, new alternative methods have shown effective results, such as artificial ultraviolet-B, natural enemies, and the introduction of new genetic methods. This review aims to present a synthesis of information surrounding control methods of T. urticae in North Africa. We highlight the principal findings of previous studies. Then, we discuss current control methods and propose new innovative research and sustainable approaches to controlling this pest. The control method can potentially extrapolate in North African regions due to its positive ecological results. Further, studies proved the use of natural enemies, myco-metabolites, bacteria metabolites, and the introduction of a genetic method in an integrated long-term sustainable program that can successfully defeat the populations of T. urticae. We also discuss high-priority research guidelines to investigate new sustainable management strategies. Setting up an integrated long-term ecological monitoring program in different Northwest African countries and incorporating new technologies into monitoring programs is an urgent need to fight this devastating pest.

AB  - We present an engineering-scale model for the migration of porosity in a fuel pellet experiencing a temperature gradient. The system of coupled pore advection and heat diffusion equations governing the problem is solved by a fixed-point iteration technique. The coupling between porosity and temperature fields is considered via the dependency of pore advection velocity on the local temperature and temperature gradient, and via the dependency of fuel thermal conductivity and of the volumetric power source on the local porosity. We employ the finite element method to discretize the resulting equations. As pure advection solutions obtained by this method are well-known to present spurious spatial oscillations, we introduce stabilization techniques in the pore advection equation. The proposed model is first tested against a benchmark problem representative for the conditions of an uranium-plutonium oxide fuel pellet irradiated in a sodium fast reactor. The results are compared to the those obtained by a model implemented in the BISON fuel performance code. The analysis shows how the results of the newly developed model are in line with those obtained by the reference model, and underlines a superior stability of the solution. The model is then applied to analyze the contribution of as-fabricated and crack-induced porosities in determining the fuel restructuring and in particular the central hole formation. A comparison to experimental data shows the impact of considering crack-induced porosity to predict the extent of the central void. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - IntroductionIn the current study, we investigate whether oral administration of agmatine (AGM) could effectively reduce motor and cognitive deficits induced by bile duct ligation (BDL) in an animal model of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) through neuroprotective mechanisms. MethodsThe Wistar rats were divided into four groups: sham, BDL, BDL+ 40 mg/kg AGM, and BDL+ 80 mg/kg AGM. The BDL rats were treated with AGM from 2 weeks after the surgery for 4 consecutive weeks. The open field, rotarod, and wire grip tests were used to assess motor function and muscle strength. The novel object recognition test (NOR) was performed to evaluate learning and memory. Finally, blood samples were collected for the analysis of the liver markers, the animals were sacrificed, and brain tissues were removed; the CA1 regions of the hippocampus and cerebellum were processed to identify apoptosis and neuronal damage rate using caspase-3 immunocytochemistry and Nissl staining. ResultsThe serological assay results showed that BDL severely impaired the function of the liver. Based on histochemical findings, BDL increased the neuronal damage in CA1 and Purkinje cells, whereas apoptosis was significantly observed only in the cerebellum. AGM treatment prevented the increase of serum liver enzymes, balance deficits, and neuronal damage in the brain areas. Apoptosis partially decreased by AGM, and there were no differences in the performance of animals in different groups in the NOR. ConclusionsThe study suggests AGM as a potential treatment candidate for HE because of its neuroprotective properties and/or its direct effects on liver function.

AB  - Introduction Exercise has significant health benefits and can enhance learning. A single bout of high-intensity resistance training may be sufficient to improve memory. This study aimed to assess memory enhancement by a single bout of high-intensity resistance training and to examine the neural underpinnings using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods Sixty young adults (34 men and 26 women), divided into the training and control groups, participated. The first session included verbal memory recall tests (cued- and free-recall), resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), and a single-bout high-intensity resistance training for the training group. Two days later, they underwent post-intervention memory tests and rs-fMRI. The study design was 2 groups x 2 sessions for memory tests, and within training group comparisons for rs-fMRI. Results Compared to the control group without resistance training, the training group showed higher cued-recall performance 2 days after the brief resistance training (training: +0.27, control: -0.13, interaction: p = .01), and their free-recall scores were associated with enhanced left posterior hippocampal connectivity (r = .64, p < .001). Conclusions These results suggest that brief high-intensity resistance exercise/strength training could enhance memory without repeated exercising. The quick effect of resistance training on memory and hippocampal connectivity could be revealed. A focused and one-shot exercise may be sufficient to enhance memory performance and neural plasticity in a few days.

AB  - Introduction: Chronic stress exposure is the main environmental factor leading to cognitive impairment, but the detailed molecular mechanism is still unclear. Adenosine Deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA1(ADAR1) is involved in the occurrence of chronic stress-induced cognitive impairment. In addition, dopamine and Adenosine 3 ' 5 '-monophosphate-regulated phospho-protein (DARPP-32) gene variation affects cognitive function. Therefore, we hypothesized that ADAR1 plays a key role in chronic stress-induced cognitive impairment by acting on DARPP-32.Methods: In this study, postnatal 21-day-old male BALB/c mice were exposed to chronic unpredictable stressors. After that, the mice were treated with ADAR1 inducer/inhibitor. The cognitive ability and cerebral DARPP-32 protein expression of BALB/c mice were evaluated. In order to explore the link between ADAR1 and DARPP-32, the effects of ADAR1 high/low expression on DARPP-32 protein expression in vitro were detected.Results: ADAR1 inducer alleviates cognitive impairment and recovers decreased DARPP-32 protein expression of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in BALB/c mice with chronic unpredictable stress exposure. In vivo and in vitro studies confirm the results predicted by bio-informatics; that is, ADAR1 affects DARPP-32 expression via miR-874-3p.Discussion: The results in this study demonstrate that ADAR1 affects the expression of DARPP-32 via miR-874-3p, which is involved in the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis in chronic unpredictable stress-induced cognitive impairment. The new findings of this study provide a new therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of stress cognitive impairment from epigenetics.

AB  - Introduction: Amphetamine (AMPH) abuse results in neurobehavioral alterations related to the reward circuit. The hippocampus plays a role in cognition, reward, and drug addiction. There are no pharmacological approaches to prevent AMPH relapse. Physical exercise has been studied as a non-pharmacological promising influence to attenuate reward symptoms related to addictive drugs.
   Objective: This study aimed to compare the effects of non-weight-loaded and weight-loaded physical exercise on behavioral (relapse, memory and anxiety) and hippocampal molecular parameters associated with AMPH addiction in Wistar rats.
   Methods: Male rats were subjected to the AMPH-Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) paradigm. After 8-conditioning days, they were subjected to swimming physical exercise protocol (without or with weight-load). Behavioral evaluations were performed to assess the influence of both exercise protocols in addiction parameters, including relapse after AMPH reconditioning, working memory, locomotor activity, and anxiety-like symptoms. Subsequently, protein levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and pro-BDNF ex-vivo assays were carried out in samples of the hippocampus of the animals.
   Results: AMPH relapse and anxiety-like behaviors were reduced only in rats subjected to non-weight-loaded exercise. Hippocampal BDNF and pro-BDNF immunoreactivity were increased in non-weight-loaded exercise rats. Behavioral and molecular analyses were not modified in rats subjected to weight-loaded exercise.
   Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that non-weight-loaded exercise was more effective against relapse and anxiety-like behavior induced by AMPH. Non-weight-loaded exercise upregulated the hippocampal immunocontent levels in rats.

AB  - Although the current COVID-19 incidence situation is not an emergency, more new strains of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus continue to emerge worldwide, some of which are more virulent than the original virus. Studies have shown that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) had a high risk of severe COVID-19, but the molecular and cellular mechanism of this predisposition is not fully elucidated. In this study, we developed a cellular model of the initial stage of COVID-19 on primary hippocampal culture of 5xFAD mice, a familial AD model, using a specific ACE2 receptor inhibitor, MLN-4760. This model is based on the experimentally proven decrease in ACE2 receptor activity observed in COVID-19 patients due to internalization of the receptor inside the cell after binding to coronavirus. Using immunochemical staining with specific antibodies to detect neurons (marker MAP2) and astroglia (marker GFAP), it was found that 24 h after the addition of MLN-4760 (0.2 nmol per 1 mL of medium) to the culture medium, there was a decrease in the density of astrocytes and neurons, a change in their morphology with a sharp reduction in the length and density of neurites, which led to death of the cell culture. The transgenic culture was more sensitive to the effect of the inhibitor compared the control hippocampal culture of native mice. In the second part of the study the possibilities of preventing the destructive effect of MLN-4760 on the hippocampal culture condition were studied. It was shown administration of YB-1, an endogenous polyfunctional stress protein, promoted restoration of cell culture structure and resulted in stimulation of neurite growth and astroglia activation. Introduction of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MMSCs) after ACE2 blockade was also accompanied by improved culture survival, restoration of cell morphology, and increased density of astrocytes and neurons. The obtained results indicate that YB-1 and cell therapy using MMSCs are promising options for the development of new effective methods to prevent the pathological effect of the virus on brain tissue, which is an important link in the treatment infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus.

AB  - Introduction: The neuropeptide Y (NPY) is broadly distributed in the central nervous system (CNS), and it has been related to neuroprotective functions. NPY seems to be an important component to counteract brain damage and cognitive impairment mediated by drugs of abuse and neurodegenerative diseases, and both NPY and its Y-2 receptor (Y2R) are highly expressed in the hippocampus, critical for learning and memory. We have recently demonstrated its influence on cognitive functions; however, the specific mechanism and involved brain regions where NPY modulates spatial memory by acting on Y2R remain unclear.
   Methods: Here, we examined the involvement of the hippocampal NPY Y2R in spatial memory and associated changes in brain metabolism by bilateral administration of the selective antagonist BIIE0246 into the rat dorsal hippocampus. To further evaluate the relationship between memory functions and neuronal activity, we analysed the regional expression of the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) as an index of oxidative metabolic capacity in limbic and non-limbic brain regions.
   Results: The acute blockade of NPY Y2R significantly improved spatial memory recall in rats trained in the Morris water maze that matched metabolic activity changes in spatial memory processing regions. Specifically, CCO activity changes were found in the dentate gyrus of the dorsal hippocampus and CA1 subfield of the ventral hippocampus, the infralimbic region of the PFC and the mammillary bodies.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that the NPY hippocampal system, through its Y2R receptor, influences spatial memory recall (retrieval) and exerts control over patterns of brain activation that are relevant for associative learning, probably mediated by Y2R modulation of long-term potentiation and long-term depression.

AB  - Nowadays, the interest in studying the impact of feed additives on the organism of piglets during critical periods of weaning remains increasingly relevant. Feed additives containing blends of essential oils with plant extracts, preparations containing dry yeast, organic acids, pro- and prebiotics are suggested to replace growth promoters and antibiotics. This contributes to the increased productivity, survivability, immune response formation, and ensuring normal intestine morphology in piglets. Proper concentrations and timing of feed additive application aimed at maintaining a healthy intestine in piglets after weaning and improving their productivity remain equally important. This study presents the results of an experiment on the use of various feed additives for piglets before weaning and their effect on the morphology of the immune system organs.The research was conducted on piglets of the Large White breed, divided into four groups of ten individuals each. From days 7 to 28 of life, various feed additives were introduced into the main diet for each group: piglets of the control group (I) received a standard nutritionally balanced diet; piglets of group II had a supplement added to the standard diet containing a combination of live yeast of the Saccharomyces genus and a complex of 6 enzymes (proteases, cellulases, xylanases, alpha-amylases, beta-glucanases, and phytases) at a rate of 0.5 kg per ton of feed; piglets of group III received a feed additive containing a blend of essential oils with plant extracts (Thymus vulgaris, Rosmarinus officinalis, Origanum vulgaris, Capsium extract) at a rate of 0.2 kg per ton of feed; piglets of group IV had a feed additive added to the main diet containing dry yeast and egg powder enriched with immunoglobulins at a rate of 2 kg per ton of feed. The main feed used in the experiment was provided in the form of fine granules. Histological examination of the thymus, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and duodenum lymphoid formations revealed that the morphological structure of the organs was preserved in piglets of all experimental groups. The partial structure of the thymus was well defined, with a clear differentiation into cortical and medullary substances. Piglets receiving the feed additive "Activo" with a blend of essential oils from plant extracts and the feed additive "Globigen Jump Start," which includes dry yeast and egg powder enriched with immunoglobulins, demonstrated a slight increase in the thymic cortex relative area, both on days 14 and 28 of the study, and an increase in the number of plasma cells. In the spleen and lymph nodes of piglets in all experimental groups, the lymphoid tissue was predominantly represented by small and medium lymphocytes; lymphoid nodules of large size with reactive centers were observed too. Brachet staining in the lymph nodes of piglets in all experimental groups revealed plasma cells with bright eosinophilia, and large nuclei predominantly with a single nucleus. However, their quantity varied, with the highest number of plasma cells observed in piglets of group IV, which received the feed additive "Globigen Jump Start" with dry yeast and egg powder enriched with immunoglobulins. Histologically, in the piglets' duodenum, the villi were closely packed, a small number of goblet cells were located between enterocytes, plasma cells with distinct eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentrically placed nuclei were localized in the lymphoid nodules of the mucous membrane and in the crypt areas. Their quantity was higher in piglets of groups III and IV.

AB  - Mammalian Ste-20-like Kinases 1 and 2 (MST1/2) are core serine-threonine kinases of the Hippo pathway regulating several cellular processes, including cell cycle arrest and cell death. Here, we discovered a novel alternative splicing variant of the MST2 encoding gene, STK3, in malignant cells and tumor datasets. This variant, named STK3(triangle 7) or MST2(triangle 7) (for mRNA or protein, respectively), resulted from the skipping of exon 7. MST2(triangle 7) exhibited increased ubiquitylation and interaction with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase CHIP compared to the full-length protein (MST2(FL)). Exon 7 in STK3 encodes a segment within the kinase domain, and its exclusion compromised MST2 interaction with and phosphorylation of MOB, a major MST1/2 substrate. Nevertheless, MST2(triangle 7) was capable of interacting with MST1 and MST2(FL). Unlike MST2(FL), overexpression of MST2(triangle 7) did not lead to increased cell death and growth arrest. Strikingly, we observed the exclusion of STK3 exon 7 in 3.2-15% of tumor samples from patients of several types of cancer, while STK3(triangle 7) was seldomly found in healthy tissues. Our study identified a novel STK3 splicing variant with loss of function and the potential to disturb tissue homeostasis by impacting on MST2 activities in the regulation of cell death and quiescence.

AB  - Plant-made oral vaccines can be a cost-effective method to control infectious diseases of humans and farm animals. Pig edema is a bacterial disease caused by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli producing the toxin Shiga toxin 2e (Stx2e). In our previous report, we chose the non-toxic B subunit of Stx2e (Stx2eB) as a vaccine antigen, and Stx2eB was expressed in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L., cv. Green wave). We found that a double repeated Stx2eB (2xStx2eB) accumulates to higher levels than a single Stx2eB. In this study, we analyzed progeny plants introduced with 2xStx2eB in which the gene was expressed under the control of conventional cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA (CaMV 35S) promoter, and found that the lettuce underwent transgene silencing and bore few seeds. We resolved these problems by using a transgene cassette which harbored a transcriptional promoter derived from the lettuce ubiquitin gene and a longer version of HSPT. The lettuce harboring this expression construct will be valuable in establishing the seed lot system on the basis that thousands of seeds can be obtained from one plant body and the resulting progeny plants accumulate 2xStx2eB at high levels without the transgene silencing.

AB  - Simple Summary Chronic heat-stress exposure directly affects broiler immune response. Immunosuppression was demonstrated in broiler exposed to chronic heat stress with deterioration in humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Natural immune modulator material is considered as a safe material for human consumption of poultry products. Citrullus colocynthis (CC) is a natural herb plant that has traditionally been used in folk remediation. Anti-diabetic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory attributes are some of the CC medical properties. The present study aims to investigate the immune modulator potentials of CC seeds supplementation to chronically heat- stressed-exposed broilers. Results demonstrated that CC seeds supplementation to heat-stressed broilers was able to alleviate the negative impacts of heat stress on broiler immune responses and antioxidant status. Thus, CC seeds are suggested to be added to broilers reared under heat stress in order to improve the immune response and consequently ameliorate productivity. There is an extensive search for natural products that can be introduced to broiler rations to improve performance, especially during the unfavorable breeding conditions. Under heat-stress conditions, the immune response seriously deteriorates, which consequently impairs broiler production performance. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the potentials of Citrullus colocynthis seeds (CCs) supplementation to modulate the immune response of broilers subjected to chronic heat stress. A total of 300 Cobb-500 male broiler chickens aged 21 days were randomly divided into two equal groups and reared under either thermo-neutral condition (24 +/- 1 degrees C) or subjected to cyclic heat stress (34 +/- 1 degrees C for 8 h). Each group was further divided into two groups (5 replicate x 15 chicks) and was fed either the basal diet or the basal diet with 0.1% CCs supplementation. The results showed that heat stress impaired the production performance by lowering the final body weight and feed intake as well as impairing feed conversion. The levels of stress markers (i.e., malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and corticosterone) increased (p < 0.05), whereas the activity of antioxidant enzymes decreased in broilers exposed to heat stress. Further, heat stress caused direct suppression of broiler humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The stimulating index of T and B lymphocytes proliferation, as well as the antibody titer against sheep red blood cells, were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced by heat-stress exposure. However, CCs supplementation to broilers subjected to heat stress improved (p < 0.05) the final body weight, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio (FCR), compared to the non-supplemented stressed group. The cellular and cell-mediated immune response indicators significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) with CCs supplementation. Supplementation of CCs to broilers reared under similar environmental conditions elevated the total white blood cells (TWBCs) count and the broiler stimulating index of T and B lymphocytes. It can be concluded that CC seeds can be effectively used to stimulate the immune response and improve the production performance of broilers reared under heat-stress condition.

AB  - Introduction The long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE1) gene is a retrotransposon whose methylation status appears to play a role in spermatogenesis, the outcome of assisted reproductive techniques (ART), and even in recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Advanced paternal age appears associated with altered sperm parameters, RPL, poor ART outcomes, and compromised offspring health. The methylation status of LINE1 has been reported to be affected by age. The latest meta-analysis on the LINE1 methylation pattern in spermatozoa found no significant differences in methylation levels between infertile patients and fertile controls. However, to the best of our knowledge, no updated meta-analysis on this topic has been published recently. Furthermore, no comprehensive meta-regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between sperm LINE1 methylation pattern and age.Objectives To provide an updated and comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis on sperm LINE1 gene methylation degree in patients with abnormal sperm parameters compared to men with normal sperm parameters and to probe the association between sperm LINE1 methylation status and age and/or sperm concentration.Methods This meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO (registration n. CRD42023397056). It was performed according to the MOOSE guidelines for Meta-analyses and Systematic Reviews of Observational Studies and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). Only original articles evaluating LINE1 gene methylation in spermatozoa from patients with infertility or abnormalities in one or more sperm parameters compared to fertile or normozoospermic men were included.Results Of 192 abstracts evaluated for eligibility, only 5 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis, involving a total of 340 patients and 150 controls. Our analysis showed no significant difference in LINE1 gene methylation degree in patients with infertility and/or abnormal sperm parameters compared to fertile controls and/or men with normal sperm parameters, although there was significant heterogeneity across studies. No significant evidence of publication bias was found, and no study was sensitive enough to alter the results. In meta-regression analysis, we found that the results were independent of both ages and sperm concentration. A sub-analysis examining patients and controls separately was also conducted and we found a trend for a positive correlation between LINE1 methylation and sperm concentration in the control group only.Conclusions The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis do not suggest a determining role of sperm LINE1 gene methylation degree in patients with infertility and/or abnormal sperm parameters. Therefore, we do not suggest including LINE1 in the genetic panel of prospective studies aimed at identifying the most representative and cost-effective genes to be analyzed in couples undergoing ART cycles.

AB  - Three new species of gobiid fish of Luciogobius Gill, 1859 have been recently discovered in Taiwan. Luciogobius chiaojinensis sp. nov. is found and collected mainly from Keelung, northern Taiwan. It can be distinguished from other congeneric species by the following combination of features: (1) second dorsal fin rays: I/10 and anal fin rays I/11; (2) pectoral fin rays modally 13 and with one upper, short free soft ray; (3) vertebral count: 20 + 21 = 41; and (4) specific coloration: head and body with small tiny blackish brown spots. Head with densely-set small blackish brown spots in male; second dorsal fin brown and darker on lower half; pectoral fin base on upper 1/2 region with round melanophores; and pectoral fin membrane mostly spotless. Luciogobius huatungensis sp. nov. is found and collected mainly from Hualien and Taitung Counties in eastern Taiwan. It can be well distinguished from other congeneric species by the following combination of features: (1) second dorsal fin modally I/15 and anal fin I/15; (2) pectoral fin rays 14 and with 4 upper, free soft rays and 1 lower free rays; (3) vertebral count: 17 + 22 = 39; and (4) specific coloration: body brown with minute creamy yellow round spots; head and body with small brown spots; belly creamy yellow with fewer brown spots; second dorsal fin with tiny white marks; and pectoral fin with several round melanophores, most membrane with brown marks. Luciogobius newtaipeiensis sp. nov. is found and collected mainly from New Taipei City in northern Taiwan. It can be well distinguished from other congeneric species by the following combination of features: (1) second dorsal fin rays: I/11 and anal fin rays I/12; (2) pectoral fin rays modally 18 and with 1 upper free soft ray; (3) vertebral count: 16 + 20 = 36; (4) a dermal projection on posterior part of eye; and (5) specific coloration: head and body with small tiny brownish black spots; second dorsal rays light brown; and pectoral fin base with many small melanophores, fin membrane with melanophores on basal region. A diagnostic key for all six nominal species of Taiwan and the Matsu Islands will be provided in this paper.

AB  - Molecular Spherical Nucleic Acids (MSNAs) are atomically uniform dendritic nanostructures and potential delivery vehicles for oligonucleotides. The radial formulation combined with covalent conjugation may hide the oligonucleotide content and simultaneously enhance the role of appropriate conjugate groups on the outer sphere. The conjugate halo may be modulated to affect the delivery properties of the MSNAs. In the present study, [60]fullerene-based molecular spherical nucleic acids, consisting of a 2 '-deoxyribonucleotide and a ribonucleotide sequence, were used as hybridization-mediated carriers ("DNA and RNA-carriers") for an antisense oligonucleotide, suppressing Tau protein, (i. e. Tau-ASO) and its conjugates with chondroitin sulfate tetrasaccharides (CS) with different sulfation patterns. The impact of the MSNA carriers, CS-moieties on the conjugates and the CS-decorations on the MSNAs on cellular uptake and - activity (Tau-suppression) of the Tau-ASO was studied with hippocampal neurons in vitro. The formation and stability of these heteroduplex ASO-MSNAs were evaluated by UV melting profile analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and size exclusion chromatography equipped with a multi angle light scattering detector (SEC-MALS). The cellular uptake and - activity were studied by confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis, respectively.

AB  - Introduction Seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) is a high-altitude plant with immense medicinal, nutritional, and therapeutic value. Earlier studies have documented the presence of various useful bioactive substances in this species; however, comprehensive metabolome profiling of seabuckthorn berries originating from different regions of the Indian Himalayas has not been undertaken. Objective Metabolomic profiling of seabuckthorn berries originating from different geographical sites in the Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir regions of the Indian Himalayas was performed by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Materials and methods The GC-MS metabolome profiles of seabuckthorn berries collected from different sites (altitude 1,400-4,270 m; average temperature 8 degrees C-27 degrees C) were subjected to multivariate analysis following principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis. Results The GC-MS results showed substantial variability for berry metabolites, including fatty acids, alkyl ethers, and alkyl esters. Fatty acids and their esters were mainly responsible for the variation in the berry metabolome. The metabolite expression profile heat map revealed two distinct groups of seabuckthorn berries originating from Himachal Pradesh (Lahaul and Spiti) and Jammu & Kashmir (Leh, Nubra, and Kargil), the former showing higher expression of metabolites. Interestingly, a strong negative association existed between altitude and the amounts of metabolites such as amides, alkyl esters, alcohols, sugars, and sugar esters. In contrast, temperature showed a strong positive association with ketone and alkyl ether levels. Conclusion GC-MS profiling provides important phytochemical indicators to distinguish between seabuckthorn berries from different geographical sites. Our metabolome profiling analysis generated valuable information that will be useful in the formulation of various seabuckthorn products, benefiting farmers and industries.

AB  - Introduction Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common form of dementia, has been reported to influence 27 million individuals globally. Several risk factors including oxidative stress, gut microbiota imbalance, and cognitive activity are reported to be closely associated with the initiation or progression of AD. Although miR-483-3p was identified to be downregulated in AD patient serum. However, the biological role and mechanism of miR-483-3p remained unknown in AD. Here, we explored the role of miR-483-3p in AD. Methods Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with homocysteine (Hcy) to establish an AD animal model. The Morris water maze tests and contextual fear tests were conducted to assess the cognitive and memory abilities of rats. TUNEL staining was utilized to determine cell apoptosis. Luciferase reporter assay was used to evaluate the binding relation between miR-483-3p and exportin 1 (XPO1). Results Homocysteine treatment (400 mu g/kg) induced the learning, cognitive and memory defects of rats. miR-483-3p was downregulated in Hcy-treated rat hippocampus. Functionally, miR-483-3p alleviated cell apoptosis and impairments of learning and memory abilities in Hcy-treated rats. In addition, miR-483-3p inhibited cell apoptosis and protein level of AD-associated factors (APP, BACE1, and A beta 1-42) in PC12 cells. In mechanism, miR-483-3p was confirmed to target XPO1 in PC12 cells. XPO1 displayed high level in rat hippocampus and was negatively correlated with miR-483-3p levels. Finally, XPO1 overexpression rescued the suppressive effect of miR-483-3p on cell apoptosis and protein levels of AD-associated factors. Conclusions miR-483-3p alleviates neural cell apoptosis and impairments of learning and memory abilities by targeting XPO1 in AD.

AB  - The effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on brain function have previously been investigated; however, the specific neurotransmitter-mediated mechanisms responsible for UV radiation-induced neurobehavioral changes remain elusive. In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying UV radiation-induced neurobehavioral changes. In a mouse model, we observed that UV irradiation of the skin induces deficits in hippocampal memory, synaptic plasticity, and adult neurogenesis, as well as increased dopamine levels in the skin, adrenal glands, and brain. Chronic UV exposure altered the expression of genes involved in dopaminergic neuron differentiation. Furthermore, chronic peripheral dopamine treatments resulted in memory deficits. Systemic administration of a dopamine D1/D5 receptor antagonist reversed changes in memory, synaptic plasticity, adult neurogenesis, and gene expression in UV-irradiated mice. Our findings provide converging evidence that chronic UV exposure alters dopamine levels in the central nervous system and peripheral organs, including the skin, which may underlie the observed neurobehavioral shifts, such as hippocampal memory deficits and impaired neurogenesis. This study underscores the importance of protection from UV exposure and introduces the potential of pharmacological approaches targeting dopamine receptors to counteract the adverse neurological impacts of UV exposure.
   Exposure to ultraviolet radiation, which is a harmful type of light from the sun, can cause skin inflammation and other health problems. This study looked at how UV radiation affects the brain, specifically focusing on dopamine, a chemical in the brain that helps control movement and emotional responses. The researchers did experiments on mice, exposing them to UV radiation and observing changes in their behavior and brain function. They found that UV radiation increased dopamine levels in the skin, adrenal glands, and brain. This increase was linked to memory loss and changes in behavior. The researchers concluded that UV radiation can affect brain function and behavior by changing dopamine levels. This study shows the importance of protecting against UV radiation and suggests that targeting dopamine receptors could help reduce the negative brain effects of UV exposure.This summary was initially drafted using artificial intelligence, then revised and fact-checked by the author.

AB  - The genus Depressaria (Lepidoptera: Depressariidae) mostly comprises specialist herbivores with varying capacity for detoxification of defensive phytochemistry. Depressaria depressana, a Eurasian moth recently introduced into North America, is a family-level specialist of the Apiaceae, whose hosts include more than a dozen species in multiple tribes; Depressaria radiella is a super-specialist of Eurasian origin that feeds exclusively on species in the genera Pastinaca and Heracleum throughout its native and introduced range. In eastern North America, it feeds upon Pastinaca sativa, an invasive European species, and Heracleum maximum, a native species. We determined whether differences in furanocoumarin metabolism exist between D. depressana and two isolated populations of D. radiella, feeding exclusively on either P. sativa or H. maximum. We also compared gravimetric estimates of feeding efficiency to assess D. depressana larval performance on different diets. Both populations of D. radiella metabolized furanocoumarins at a greater rate than D. depressana. Although there was no difference in rates of metabolism of linear furanocoumarins in the two populations of D. radiella, individuals collected from H. maximum metabolized angular furanocoumarins more rapidly. The gravimetric assessments of feeding efficiencies revealed that D. depressana exhibited highest efficiencies consuming Daucus carota; moreover, this species survived to pupation consuming fruits of Zizia aurea, an apiaceous species native to North America. Our preliminary phylogenetic analysis, building on an earlier morphological analysis, incorporates mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 data from the BOLD database and revealed that the presence or absence of furanocoumarins is not a strong predictor of species-level evolution in Depressaria.

AB  - In the production of natural sausage casings, three layers of serosa, muscular, and mucosa are removed from gastro-intestinal wall of sheep as waste materials. The submocusa layer is taken for further processing. There is no report about generating added value out of these wastes. In this study, a novel approach was introduced for bioconversion of waste gastro-intestinal wall (WGW) to a value-added product. Alkaline hydrolysis of WGW was investigated and the hydrolysate was utilized for cultivation of Dunaliella salina, a value-added biomass. The hydrolysate that contained the highest total soluble protein was used for three sets of cultivations on different medium compositions, i.e., (1) cultivations on the modified Johnson's medium enriched with different percentage of hydrolysate (0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 (%v/v)), (2) cultivations on modified Johnson's medium which was free of nitrogen and carbon sources and enriched with different percentage of hydrolysate (0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 (%v/v), and (3) cultivation on modified Johnson's medium which was free of nitrogen source and enriched with 2.5% hydrolysate. The results showed that WGW contained 60.7, 8.4, 15.8, and 15.2% protein, lipid, moisture, and ash, respectively and the enrichment of the medium with the hydrolysate (2.5%) increased biomass productivity by 20%. Additionally, substitution of 2.5% hydrolysate for nitrogen source (KNO3) resulted in the same biomass productivity. The results of this study revealed the potential of the hydrolysate as an alternative for KNO3 in cultivation of D. salina. Overall, this work proposed a novel approach for converting waste gastro-intestinal wall to value.

AB  - Air potato, Dioscorea bulbifera L., is an invasive vine found in the southeastern United States and is native to Asia and Africa. The air potato leaf beetle Lilioceris cheni (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is a host specific biological control agent introduced for D. bulbifera control. In this study, odor cues that control the attraction of L. cheni to D. bulbifera were investigated. The first experiment investigated the response of L. cheni to D. bulbifera leaves versus no leaves in the presence or absence of air flow. The experiment showed a significant response of L. cheni to D. bulbifera leaves in the presence of air flow with leaves placed upwind. When air flow and/or leaves were absent, L. cheni dispersed randomly between the upwind and downwind targets, indicating L. cheni uses volatiles from D. bulbifera in host selection. The second experiment investigated L. cheni response to undamaged, larval-damaged, and adult-damaged plants. Lilioceris cheni showed preference to move towards conspecific damaged plants compared to undamaged plants but did not discriminate between larvae-damaged or adult-damaged plants. The third experiment investigated volatile profiles of damaged D. bulbifera plants using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy. We found significant differences in volatile profiles between adult and larval damaged plants compared to mechanically damaged and undamaged plants, with increases in 11 volatile compounds. However, larval and adult-damaged volatile profiles did not differ. The information acquired during this study could be used to develop strategies to monitor for L. cheni and improve its biological control program.

AB  - Introduction Anthracnose poses a significant threat to the sustainable development of the Camellia oleifera industry. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of melatonin-induced Bacillus tequilensis DZY6715 (MT-DZY 6715) in controlling C. oleifera anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum siamense.Methods The antifungal activity of MT-DZY6715 against C. siamense was systematically evaluated in vitro dual-culture assays and in planta infection trials. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of MT-DZY 6715 on the anatomical features of C. oleifera leaves using histological sectioning. Additionally, transcriptome and enzymatic assays were employed to assess the expression of secondary metabolism-related genes and the activity of cell wall-degrading enzymes.Results The application of MT-DZY 6715 effectively controls the growth of C. siamense, markedly reducing the incidence of C. oleifera anthracnose and delaying the spread of pathogens on the leaves. Furthermore, MT-DZY 6715 treatment enhanced leaf thickness, palisade mesophyll, as well as elevated the ratio of palisade mesophyll to spongy mesophyll (PS) and tissue compactness (CTR), while simultaneously decreasing tissue looseness (SR). Meanwhile, the leaf stomata undergo a reduction in size and a decrease in their openness. In addition, MT-DZY 6715 promoted the expression of secondary metabolism-related genes, such as PAL, CAL, Laccase, HCT, and CHI, and inhibited the activity of enzymes related to cell wall degradation (pectinase and cellulase), thereby coordinating and enhancing the accumulation of secondary metabolites and strengthening the mechanical properties of the cell wall.Discussion The results of this study demonstrate that MT-DZY 6715 enhances the resistance of C. oleifera to anthracnose by modulating leaf morphology, regulating stomatal function, and promoting the accumulation of secondary metabolites. These findings provides a scientific foundation for deploying MT-DZY6715 as an eco-friendly alternative to chemical fungicides in anthracnose management.

AB  - Introduction Camellia oleifera, a crucial woody oil crop in China, produces seeds with over 90% unsaturated fatty acids offering substantial nutritional value and exists predominantly as cultivated tetraploid varieties (2n=4x=60) due to its polyploid nature. The DNA-binding with one finger (Dof) transcription factor play multiple roles in plant growth, development, and abiotic stress response pathways. However, the regulatory mechanisms of Dof genes underlying fatty acids/lipids biosynthesis during seed morphogenesis in Camellia oleifera remain poorly characterized.Methods In this study, genome-wide identified a total of 40 members of the CoDof family with 116 alleles in tetraploid Camellia oleifera (COL-tetra).Results All members possess varying numbers of highly conserved C2-C2-type zinc finger domains. Phylogenetic analysis clustered CoDof genes into nine categories, and significant divergence was observed in the expression levels of all family members across different growth and development stages of COL-tetra seeds. After physiological data determination at various levels, differential expression analysis and correlation analysis of fatty acid/lipid synthesis genes revealed that CoDof30.1 is a typical candidate nuclear-localized transcription factor which significantly highly expressed in the middle period of seed development.Discussion Our findings not only comprehensively characterize the genomic organization of CoDof family but also propose a functional candidate for lipid biosynthesis regulation, thereby advancing molecular breeding strategies and elite cultivar selection in COL-tetra.

AB  - Aphids cause massive agricultural losses through direct damage or as pathogen vectors. Control often relies on insecticides, which are expensive and not selective. An interesting alternative is to use aphid sex pheromones nepetalactone (NON) and nepetalactol (NOL) to interfere with aphid mating or attract aphid predators. Here, we explore production of these compounds in plants, as their precursors can be derived from mevalonate (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways. By introducing six genes, including a major latex protein-like (MLPL) enzyme, we engineered a functional nepetalactol biosynthetic pathway into plants. Transient expression of these enzymes in N. benthamiana caused production of nepetalactone, without the need for external supplementation with substrates. Targeting all six enzymes into the chloroplast appeared to result in higher NON yields than just chloroplast-targeting the first two enzymes. We could not detect NOL, suggesting it is rapidly oxidised to NON. In addition, we produced NON in stably transformed Camelina sativa (Camelina) lines. Interestingly, the specific NON enantiomer was different in N. benthamiana compared to in Camelina, indicating the value of different platforms for producing specific isoforms. This opens possibilities for using plants as green factories of pheromones for baits or as pheromone dispensers that interfere with insect behaviour.

AB  - IntroductionCamellia is among the most ornamentally valuable flowers and plants worldwide. Flower abscission typically causes significant financial losses by the horticultural landscape. Previous research has revealed that phytohormones, transcription factors, and other genes involved in floral development regulate the maintenance and mortality of flowers MethodsIn this study, for the first time, the transcriptomes and targeted hormone metabolomics of three developmental stages of the receptacles of two distinct camellia strains (CF: abscission strain, CHF: nonabscission strain) were analyzed to determine their roles in regulating blossom abscission in camellia. ResultsABA content was shown to be considerably upregulated throughout all phases of CF development, as were the genes implicated in the ABA production pathway and their downstream counterparts. Highly expressed genes in CF were involved in galactose metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, amino and nucleotide sugar metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and MAPK. Among others, highly expressed genes in CHF are associated with fructose and mannose metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, starch and sucrose metabolism, and cutin, suberin, and wax biosynthesis. A vast variety of stress response-related pathways and redox-related activities were also shown to be active in CHF. In contrast, CF dramatically activated pathways associated with lignin production, keratinogenesis, cell wall biogenesis, and ABA response. A comparative transcriptomic study of the CF and CHF pathways revealed that the downstream response pathways of hormones, including CTK, BR, IAA, ethylene, and GA, were very active in CF, indicating a significant amount of signal transduction and transcriptional regulation by CF. In addition, members of the transcription factor family, such as MYB, bHLH, MADS, and WD40, may regulate flower abscission. DiscussionA comparative transcriptome analysis of two distinct strains of camellia receptacles elucidates the molecular processes and regulatory characteristics of flower abscission and provides direction for the targeted improvement and breeding of camellia.

AB  - Introduction The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family is one of the largest gene families in plants, extensively involved in plant growth, organ development, and stress responses. However, limited studies of this family are available in sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides).Methods In this study, we identified 144 bHLH genes in H. rhamnoides (HrbHLH) through a genome-wide search method, then explored their DNA and protein sequences and physicochemical properties.Results and discussion According to the sequence similarities, we classified them into 15 groups with specific motif structures. To explore their expressions, we performed gene expression profiling using RNA-Seq and identified 122 HrbHLH mRNAs were highly expressed, while the remaining 22 HrbHLH genes were expressed at very low levels in all 21 samples. Among these HrbHLH genes, HrbHLH47, HrbHLH74, HrbHLH90, HrbHLH131 showed the highest expression level in the root nodule, root, leaf, stem and fruit tissues. Furthermore, eleven HrbHLH genes displayed increased expressions during the fruit development process of sea buckthorn. Finally, we validated the expression patterns of HrbHLH genes using reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR). This comprehensive analysis provides a useful esource that enables further investigation of the physiological roles and molecular functions of the HrbHLH TFs.

AB  - Plants show sequential immune responses, pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), followed by effector-triggered immunity (ETI). The long-lasting MAPK activity during ETI triggers activation of robust ROS burst mediated by an NADPH oxidase in plasma membrane, also in chloroplasts. Mining of hydrogen peroxide receptors, ROS sensor proteins seems important to elucidate the ROS-dependent cellular events. We also introduce live-imaging system of MAPK activity by producing FRET-based biosensor at the single cell and organelle levels. The obser-vation of spatiotemporal MAPK activities in response to pathogen and herbivore attacks will provide new insights into the positioning of MAPK and ROS in the plant immunity.

AB  - IntroductionThe leaf-chewing pest Heortia vitessoides severely threatens the growth and development of Aquilaria sinensis. In our previous study, we found that mechanical damage (MD) to stem enhanced A. sinensis sapling resistance to H. vitessoides larvae. MethodsTo reveal the defense mechanisms underlying this observation, we analyzed the types and contents of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), phytohormone contents, and expression of phytohormone-related genes in response to MD and herbivory wounding(HW). ResultsHere, we identified several VOCs, such as the pesticides fenobucarb and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, in mature leaf (ML) of MD-treated plants. Compared with salicylic acid (SA) or the ethylene (ET) pathway, jasmonic acid (JA) content and JA-related genes were more strongly upregulated. Interestingly, we found a dramatic difference between JA-related upstream and downstream genes expression in YL and ML, which confirmed that JA-Ile accumulation in MD-ML and HW-ML could be derived from local damaged site. DiscussionTaken together, we provide evidence that the JA pathway plays a dominant role in the A. sinensis response to MD and HW.

AB  - IntroductionLow temperatures and drought are two main environmental constraints reducing the yield and geographical distribution of horticultural crops worldwide. Understanding the genetic crosstalk between stress responses has potential importance for crop improvement. MethodsIn this study, Illumina RNA-seq and Pac-Bio genome resequencing were used to annotate genes and analyze transcriptome dynamics in tea plants under long-term cold, freezing, and drought. ResultsThe highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was identified under long-term cold (7,896) and freezing (7,915), with 3,532 and 3,780 upregulated genes, respectively. The lowest number of DEGs was observed under 3-day drought (47) and 9-day drought (220), with five and 112 genes upregulated, respectively. The recovery after the cold had 6.5 times greater DEG numbers as compared to the drought recovery. Only 17.9% of cold-induced genes were upregulated by drought. In total, 1,492 transcription factor genes related to 57 families were identified. However, only 20 transcription factor genes were commonly upregulated by cold, freezing, and drought. Among the 232 common upregulated DEGs, most were related to signal transduction, cell wall remodeling, and lipid metabolism. Co-expression analysis and network reconstruction showed 19 genes with the highest co-expression connectivity: seven genes are related to cell wall remodeling (GATL7, UXS4, PRP-F1, 4CL, UEL-1, UDP-Arap, and TBL32), four genes are related to calcium-signaling (PXL1, Strap, CRT, and CIPK6), three genes are related to photo-perception (GIL1, CHUP1, and DnaJ11), two genes are related to hormone signaling (TTL3 and GID1C-like), two genes are involved in ROS signaling (ERO1 and CXE11), and one gene is related to the phenylpropanoid pathway (GALT6). DiscussionBased on our results, several important overlapping mechanisms of long-term stress responses include cell wall remodeling through lignin biosynthesis, o-acetylation of polysaccharides, pectin biosynthesis and branching, and xyloglucan and arabinogalactan biosynthesis. This study provides new insight into long-term stress responses in woody crops, and a set of new target candidate genes were identified for molecular breeding aimed at tolerance to abiotic stresses.

AB  - Introduction Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are products of plant secondary metabolism with the potential for signalling early stress response. This pilot study investigated the potential of VOCs as markers for drought stress in potato. We hypothesised that differences in VOC emissions between cultivars may reflect genotypes with greater adaptive efficiency to drought stress.Methods Using thermal desorption collection and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques, we profiled the VOCs emitted by two potato cultivars, Maris Piper and D & eacute;sir & eacute;e, under well-watered and drought conditions, across a four-week period (n = 3 per cultivar, treatment, and time-point).Results We identified 23 compounds, and tentatively identified another 49 compounds, including sesquiterpenes, alkanes, monoterpenes, and methylbenzenes. Statistical analysis revealed that seven compounds showed significant differences between cultivars and drought/well-watered treatments. Two farnesene isomers, a xylene isomer, 2,6-dimethyldecane, decahydronaphthalene, and 2-methyldecalin were identified as tentative markers of drought stress.Discussion Our findings suggest that VOCs could be used for detection of drought stress in potato plants, contributing to improved irrigation management and the breeding of more drought-tolerant varieties. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - CONSTANS-Like genes play critical roles in plant responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses, but their functions in Rosa chinensis remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide investigation of COL genes in R. chinensis, identifying 18 genes, designated from RcCOL_1 to RcCOL_18. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these genes were unevenly distributed across three subfamilies (RcCOL_I to RcCOL_III), with RcCOL_III containing the most members. Interspecies evolutionary analysis of 14 Rosaceae species showed that COL genes presented across all these species, though the number of genes varied. Cis-acting element analysis indicated that the RcCOL genes mainly contained elements related to biotic and abiotic stress, light response, as well as growth and development, with RcCOL_4/_13/_14/_15, RcCOL_8/_17/_18, and RcCOL_5/_6/_16 showing highly consistent element distributions. Expression pattern analysis under red spider (Tetranychus urticae) attack revealed that subfamilies I and II of the COL gene family play a primary role in the regulation of plant response. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) verification showed that nearly all RcCOL genes were highly expressed following red spider infestation; however, these over-expressed genes were suppressed after introducing predatory mite (Neoseiulus californicus). This indicates that the RcCOL genes may play significant roles in the biotic stress response in R. chinensis. Correlation analysis of RcCOL genes with secondary metabolites demonstrated strong associations. For instance, RcCOL_1 and RcCOL_2 were highly correlated with geranylacetone, periplogenin, and syringetin, while RcCOL_3 and RcCOL_12 showed strong correlations with Nacetyltryptamine, uridine 5 '-monophosphate, and isorhamnetin. Additionally, RcCOL_7 was highly correlated with L-serine and 3-methylxanthine, and RcCOL_10 with byakangelicin, hippuric acid, and nicotineamide. RcCOL_14 and RcCOL_15 were strongly correlated with metabolites such as pidotimod, vinorelbine tartrate, and okadaic acid. These findings suggest that RcCOL genes modulate secondary metabolite production and play critical roles in the biotic stress response of plants.

AB  - In recent years, the development of solid-state lighting devices has increasingly shifted towards high-power laser illumination, making it imperative to develop fluorescent conversion materials with exceptional thermal stability and luminous quality. In this study, we introduced a highly reflective TiO2 substrate in combination with a high thermal conductivity AlN substrate to design a Ce:YAG-PiG-TiO2-AlN Film (Ce:YAG PTAF) color converter with outstanding photothermal performance. Remarkably, the thermal conductivity of this material reaches 48.28 W m(-1) K-1. Notably, the optimized PTAF can withstand a high-power output of up to 12.14 W in a static environment, with a maximum luminous flux (LFmax) of 2284.6 lm and maximum luminous efficacy (LEmax) of 222.35 lm W-1, showcasing its excellent optical properties. Furthermore, the fabricated Ce:YAG-PiG-TiO2-AlN-Wheel (Ce:YAG PTAW), equipped with a motor operating at 7200 r/min, emits an extraordinary brightness of 4404 lm under 88 W of ultra-high laser irradiation, with stability surpassing that of commercial silicone color wheels, thanks to its superior Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 (LAS) glass system. Interestingly, we designed an innovative spatially separated two-color segmented wheel structure, effectively mitigating the photon reabsorption phenomenon caused by the overlap of the fluorescent powder absorption peaks. When the ratio of Ce:YAG to Ce:GdYAG is 240:120, it yields white light with a color rendering index (CRI) of 80.2, and luminous flux remaining at 3317.8 lm. When encapsulated in a reflective module, it accurately reflects the true color states of objects.

AB  - Simple Summary In this paper, we present the zooarchaeological and taphonomic study of a new Bronze Age site in the inland of the Iberian Peninsula. This study represents a significant contribution within the studied area, as it analyses the Pista de Motos faunal collection, one of the few representative samples from this period. This paper significantly contributes to completing the scarce information available for the Bronze Archaeology in the Middle Tagus Valley, located inland of the Iberian Peninsula.Abstract The Bronze Age zooarchaeological research for the interior and other regions of the Iberian Peninsula is currently limited. Despite several sites with known zooarchaeological profiles from the period, the main issue is that most of these derive from fragmentary and unrepresentative faunal records or are biased profiles from old excavations. New work has yielded novel zooarchaeological results in recent years that could help fill the existing zooarchaeological information gap in the Iberian inland, particularly in the Middle Tagus Valley. However, these projects are in the initial research stages and have not published much of their results. This paper presents the zooarchaeological profile of the Pista de Motos Bronze Age site to help fill this information gap. It analyses the taxonomic representation, skeletal profiles, and human activity patterns associated with faunal use. These observations suggest that animal exploitation at the site followed two primary purposes. One was linked to economic activities, mainly to obtain meat, milk, wool, or animal labour. The other was probably associated with symbolic-ritual practices suggested by the complete animal burials in some excavated units. We contextualise these interpretations with evidence from other Bronze Age sites in the Middle Tagus Valley. Finally, the paper assesses to what extent Pista de Motos is a relevant site for the zooarchaeology of the Bronze Age in the Iberian inland.

AB  - Introduction: Acetate has been shown to have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. It is oxi-dized by astrocytes and can thus provide auxiliary energy to the brain in addition to glucose. Therefore, we hypothesized that it may protect against seizures, which is investigated here by feeding glyceryl triacetate (GTA), to provide high amounts of acetate without raising sodium or acid levels.Method: CD1 male mice were fed controlled diets with or without GTA for up to three weeks. Body weights, blood glucose levels, plasma short-chain fatty acid levels, and other hematological parameters were monitored. Seizure thresholds were determined in 6 Hz and maximal electroshock seizure thresh-old (MEST) tests. Antioxidant capacities were evaluated in the cerebral cortex and plasma using a ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay.Results: Body weight gain was similar with both diets with and without GTA in two experiments. Glyceryl triacetate-fed groups showed 2-3-and 1.6-fold increased acetate and propionate levels in plasma, respectively. Glucose levels were unaltered in blood collected from the tail tip but increased in trunk blood. No differences were found in the activity of cerebral cortex acetyl-CoA synthetase. In the 6 Hz threshold test, seizure thresholds were lower by 3 mA and 2.4 mA after 8 and 14 days, respectively, in the GTA compared to the control diet-fed group, but showed no difference on day 16, showing that GTA has small, but inconsistent proconvulsant effects in this model. In MEST tests, a slightly increased seizure threshold (1 mA) was found on day 19 in the GTA-fed group, but not in another experiment on day 21. There were no differences in antioxidant capacity in plasma or cortex between the two groups. Conclusion: Glyceryl triacetate feeding showed no antioxidant effects nor beneficial changes in acute electrical seizure threshold mouse models, despite its ability to increase plasma acetate levels.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - IntroductionEpisodic memory formation requires the binding of multiple associations to a coherent episodic representation, with rich detail of times, places, and contextual information. During postnatal development, the ability to recall episodic memories emerges later than other types of memory such as object recognition. However, the precise developmental trajectory of episodic memory, from weaning to adulthood has not yet been established in rats. Spontaneous object exploration tasks do not require training, and allow repeated testing of subjects, provided novel objects are used on each trial. Therefore, these tasks are ideally suited for the study of the ontogeny of episodic memory and its constituents (e.g., object, spatial, and contextual memory). MethodsIn the present study, we used four spontaneous short-term object exploration tasks over two days: object (OR), object-context (OCR), object-place (OPR), and object-place-context (OPCR) recognition to characterise the ontogeny of episodic-like memory and its components in three commonly used outbred rat strains (Lister Hooded, Long Evans Hooded, and Sprague Dawley). ResultsIn longitudinal studies starting at 3-4 weeks of age, we observed that short term memory for objects was already present at the earliest time point we tested, indicating that it is established before the end of the third week of life (consistent with several other reports). Object-context memory developed during the fifth week of life, while both object-in-place and the episodic-like object-place-context memory developed around the seventh postnatal week. To control for the effects of previous experience in the development of associative memory, we confirmed these developmental trajectories using a cross-sectional protocol. DiscussionOur work provides robust evidence for different developmental trajectories of recognition memory in rats depending on the content and/or complexity of the associations and emphasises the utility of spontaneous object exploration tasks to assess the ontogeny of memory systems with high temporal resolution.

AB  - Introduction Epigenetic modifications have emerged as key contributors to the enduring behavioral, molecular and epigenetic neuroadaptations during withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure. The present study investigated the long-term consequences of chronic alcohol exposure on spatial working memory (WM) and associated changes of transcriptionally repressive histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC).Methods Male C57BL/6 mice were allowed free access to either 12% (v/v) ethanol for 5 months followed by a 3-week abstinence period or water. Spatial WM was assessed through the spontaneous alternation T-maze test. Alcoholic and water mice received daily injections of GABAB agonist baclofen or saline during alcohol fading and early withdrawal. Global levels of histone modifications were determined by immunohistochemistry.Results Withdrawal mice displayed WM impairments along with reduced prefrontal H3K9me2 levels, compared to water-drinking mice. The withdrawal-induced decrease of H3K9me2 occurred concomitantly with increased level of permissive H3K9 acetylation (H3K9ac) in the PFC. Baclofen treatment rescued withdrawal-related WM deficits and fully restored prefrontal H3K9me2 and H3K9ac. Alcohol withdrawal induced brain region-specific changes of H3K9me2 and H3K9ac after testing, with significant decreases of both histone marks in the dorsal hippocampus and no changes in the amygdala and dorsal striatum. Furthermore, the magnitude of H3K9me2 in the PFC, but not the hippocampus, significantly and positively correlated with individual WM performances. No correlation was observed between H3K9ac and behavioral performance. Results also indicate that pre-testing intraperitoneal injection of UNC0642, a selective inhibitor of histone methyltransferase G9a responsible for H3K9me2, led to WM impairments in water-drinking and withdrawal-baclofen mice. Collectively, our results demonstrate that alcohol withdrawal induced brain-region specific alterations of H3K9me2 and H3K9ac, an effect that persisted for at least three weeks after cessation of chronic alcohol intake.Conclusion The findings suggest a role for long-lasting decreased H3K9me2 specifically in the PFC in the persistent WM impairments related to alcohol withdrawal.

AB  - Targeted mutagenesis in model organisms is key for gene functional annotation and biomedical research. Despite technological advances in gene editing by the CRISPR-Cas9 systems, rapid and efficient introduction of site-directed mutations remains a challenge in large animal models. Here, we developed a robust and flexible insertional mutagenesis strategy, homology-independent targeted trapping (HIT-trapping), which is generic and can efficiently target-trap an endogenous gene of interest independent of homology arm and embryonic stem cells. Further optimization and equipping the HIT-trap donor with a site-specific DNA inversion mechanism enabled one-step generation of reversible and conditional alleles in a single experiment. As a proof of concept, we successfully created mutant alleles for 21 disease-related genes in primary porcine fibroblasts with an average knock-in frequency of 53.2%, a great improvement over previous approaches. The versatile HIT-trapping strategy presented here is expected to simplify the targeted generation of mutant alleles and facilitate large-scale mutagenesis in large mammals such as pigs.

AB  - Background: Apoptotic cells' phosphoserine (PS) groups have a significant immunosuppressive effect. They inhibit proinflammatory signals by interacting with various immune cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and CD4+ cells. Previously, we synthesized PS-group-immobilized polymers and verified their immunomodulatory effects. Despite its confirmed immunomodulatory potential, the PS group has not been considered as a payload for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) in a targeted anti-inflammatory approach. Aim: We conducted this research to introduce an apoptotic-cell-inspired antibody-drug conjugate for effective immunomodulation. Method: Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylserine) (p(HEMA-co-MPS)) was synthesized as a payload using RAFT polymerization, and goat anti-mouse IgG was selected as a model antibody, which was conjugated with the synthesized p(HEMA-co-MPS) via 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/N-Hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) reaction. The antibody-binding affinity, anti-inflammatory potential, and cytotoxicity measurements were evaluated. Results: We successfully synthesized ADCs with a significant anti-inflammatory effect and optimized the antibody-polymer ratio to achieve the highest antibody-binding affinity. Conclusion: We successfully introduced p(HEMA-co-MPS) to IgG without decreasing the anti-inflammatory potential of the polymer while maintaining its targeting ability. We suggest that the antibody-polymer ratio be appropriately adjusted for effective therapy. In the future, this technology can be applied to therapeutic antibodies, such as Tocilizumab or Abatacept.

AB  - Despite the fact that the current situation with COVID-19 incidence is not an emergency, new strains of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus continue to appear in the world, some of them with higher virulence compared to the original virus. Studies have shown that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) had a high risk of severe COVID-19, but the molecular and cellular mechanism of this predisposition is not fully elucidated. In this study, we developed a cellular model of the initial stage of COVID-19 on primary hippocampal culture of 5xFAD mice, a model of the familial AD, using the specific ACE2 receptor inhibitor MLN-4760. This model is based on the experimentally proven decrease in ACE2 receptor activity observed in COVID-19 patients due to internalization of the receptor inside the cell after binding to coronavirus. Using immunochemical staining with specific antibodies for detection of neurons (marker MAP2) and astroglia (marker GFAP) it was found that 24 h after addition of MLN-4760 (0.2 nmol per 1 mL of medium) to the culture medium there was a decrease in the density of astrocytes and neurons, a change in their morphology with a sharp reduction in the length and density of neurites, which led to the death of the cell culture. The transgenic culture turned out to be more sensitive to the effect of the inhibitor compared to the control hippocampal culture of native mice. In the second part of the study the possibilities of preventing the destructive effect of MLN-4760 on the hippocampal culture were studied. It was shown that administration of YB-1, an endogenous multifunctional stress protein, promoted restoration of cell culture structure and resulted in stimulation of neurite growth and astroglia activation. Introduction of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MMSCs) after ACE2 blockade was also accompanied by improved culture survival, restoration of cell morphology, and increased density of astrocytes and neurons. These results suggest that YB-1 and cell therapy using MMSCs are promising options for the development of new effective methods to prevent the pathologic effects of the virus on brain tissue, which is an important link in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.

AB  - World-wide some 658 million people were infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and millions suffer from chemosensory impairment associated with long COVID. Current treatments for taste and smell disorders are limited. Involving patients has the potential to catalyze the dynamic exchange and development of new ideas and approaches to facilitate biomedical research and therapeutics. We assessed patients' perceptions of the efficacy of treatments for chemosensory impairment using an online questionnaire completed by 5,815 people in the US Logistic regression determined variables predictive of reported treatment efficacy for patients aged 18 to 24, 25 to 39, 40 to 60, and 60+ yrs. who were treated with nasal steroids, oral steroids, zinc, nasal rinse, smell training, theophylline, platelet-rich plasma, and Omega 3. The most consistent predictor was age, with the majority of those 40 to 60 and 60+ reporting that nasal steroids, oral steroids, zinc, nasal rinse, and smell training were only slightly effective or not effective at all. Many of these treatment strategies target regeneration and immune response, processes compromised by age. Only those under 40 reported more than slight efficacy of steroids or smell training. Findings emphasize the need to include patients of all ages in clinical trials. Older adults with olfactory impairment are at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We speculate that olfactory impairment associated with long COVID introduces the potential for a significant rise in AD. Long COVID-associated chemosensory impairment increases the urgency for translational and clinical research on novel treatment strategies. Suggestions for high-priority areas for epidemiological, basic, and clinical research on chemosensory impairment follow.

AB  - Veterinary drugs are frequently employed to treat and prevent diseases in food-producing animals to improve animal health and to avoid the introduction of microorganisms into the food chain. The analysis of the presence of pharmaceutical residues in animal manure could help to evaluate the legal and illegal practices during food production without harming the animals and to correctly manage manure when it is going to be applied as a fertilizer. This article describes a method for the simultaneous analysis of 29 active substances, mostly antibiotics and antiparasitic agents. Substances were extracted from lyophilized manure with a methanol:McIlvaine solution and analyzed with HPLC-ESI-MS/MS and a C18 HPLC column. The method was validated following European guidelines, the achieved trueness was between 63 and 128% (depending on the analytes), and the linearity was between 100 and 1500 mu g/kg. The applicability of the method was demonstrated in 40 manure samples collected from pig farms where tetracycline was quantified in 7.5% of the samples. These results show the viability of this non-invasive method for the control of the legal and illegal administration of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals.

AB  - Simple Summary Upper respiratory tract viral infections are among the most common diseases. The blood-brain barrier protects the brain from direct invasion of pathogens. However, the cells share their content with other cells in small nanovesicles called exosomes that can travel long distances and cross biological barriers. Therefore, virus-infected cell extracellular vesicles (EVs) might transmit inflammatory signals or even viral particles to other cells. If they would carry such signals or particles to the central nervous system, it might cause neuroinflammation. However, the migration and impact of virus-primed airway cell EVs on the brain have not been studied yet. Therefore, the study aimed to track airway EVs from the respiratory tract to the brain and determine how infection-primed particles affect microglia-the cells responsible for immune response in the brain. The study revealed that airway cell EVs enter the brain within an hour and gather in microglia. Interestingly, many airway EVs were found in the hippocampus, the region most affected by Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, EVs from virus-infected airway cells stimulated reactive oxygen species in microglia and induced other inflammation mediators in the brain. Thus, airway cells indeed might communicate inflammatory information to the brain during viral infection. Viral infections induce extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing viral material and inflammatory factors. Exosomes can easily cross the blood-brain barrier during respiratory tract infection and transmit the inflammatory signal to the brain; however, such a hypothesis has no experimental evidence. The study investigated whether exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) from virus mimetic poly (I:C)-primed airway cells enter the brain and interact with brain immune cells microglia. Airway cells were isolated from Wistar rats and BALB/c mice; microglial cell cultures-from Wistar rats. ELVs from poly (I:C)-stimulated airway cell culture medium were isolated by precipitation, visualised by transmission electron microscopy, and evaluated by nanoparticle analyser; exosomal markers CD81 and CD9 were determined by ELISA. For in vitro and in vivo tracking, particles were loaded with Alexa Fluor 555-labelled RNA. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated by DCFDA fluorescence and mitochondrial superoxide-by MitoSOX. ELVs from poly (I:C)-primed airway cells entered the brain within an hour after intranasal introduction, were internalised by microglia and induced intracellular and intramitochondrial ROS production. There was no ROS increase in microglial cells was after treatment with ELVs from airway cells untreated with poly (I:C). In addition, poly (I:C)-primed airway cells induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the brain. The data indicate that ELVs secreted by virus-primed airway cells might enter the brain, cause the activation of microglial cells and neuroinflammation.

AB  - Our knowledge on how the local distribution pattern of ordinary and novel hosts promotes or hinders the progress of adaptation to the novel hosts by phytophagous insects is limited. The herbivorous ladybird beetle Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) depends mainly on solanaceous plants as hosts; the major wild host of this beetle species in Java, Indonesia, is Solanum torvum. However, in several regions of Southeast Asia, including Java, H. vigintioctopunctata also occurs on the introduced fabaceous weed, Centrosema molle. Circumstantial evidence indicates that the use of C. molle by beetles became frequent in the very early 2000s in East Java. In the present study, based on laboratory and field data obtained from 2003 to 2005, we evaluated the degree of adaptation to C. molle by H. vigintioctopunctata populations from East Java and documented the geographic pattern of host-plant distribution in East Java. Laboratory experiments revealed that the beetles from East Java possessed the highest degree of adaptation to C. molle among the beetle populations thus far investigated, suggesting that the adaptation to C. molle by beetles proceeded quite rapidly in East Java in the early 2000s. Meanwhile, field surveys showed that the habitats in East Java consisted of mosaics with sites where only C. molle was distributed and sites where C. molle and solanaceous plants co-occurred. We discussed the role of such geographical structure of habitats in promoting the rapid adaptation of H. vigintioctopunctata to C. molle in East Java.

AB  - Introduction: Organs procured following brain stem death (BSD) are the main source of organ grafts for transplantation. However, BSD is associated with inflammatory responses that may damage the organ and affect both the quantity and quality of organs available for transplant. Therefore, we aimed to investigate plasma andbronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles and cardiovascular physiology in a clinically relevant 6-h ovinemodel of BSD. Methods: Twelve healthy female sheep (37-42 Kg) were anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated prior to undergoing BSD induction and then monitored for 6 h. Plasma and BAL endothelin-1 and cytokines (IL-1b, 6, 8 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a)) were assessed by ELISA. Differential white blood cell counts were performed. Cardiac function during BSD was also examined using echocardiography, and cardiac biomarkers (A-type natriuretic peptide and troponin I were measured in plasma. Results: Plasma concentrations big ET-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a and BAL IL-8 were significantly (p < 0.01) increased over baseline at 6 h post-BSD. Increased numbers of neutrophils were observed in the whole blood (3.1 x 10(9) cells/L [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.06-4.14] vs. 6 x 10(9) cells/L [95%CI 3.92-7.97]; p< 0.01) andBAL (4.5 x 10(9) cells/L [95%CI0.41-9.41] vs. 26[95%CI 12.29e39.80]; p = 0.03) after 6 h of BSD induction vs baseline. A significant increase in ANP production(20.28pM[95%CI 16.18-24.37] vs. 78.68pM[95%CI 53.16-104.21]; p< 0.0001) and cTnI release (0.039 ng/mL vs. 4.26 [95%CI 2.69-5.83] ng/mL; p < 0.0001), associated with a significant reduction in heart contractile function, were observed between baseline and 6 h. Conclusions: BSD induced systemic pro-inflammatory responses, characterized by increased neutrophil infiltration and cytokine production in the circulation and BAL fluid, and associated with reduced heart contractile function in ovine model of BSD.

AB  - Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki and C. gestroi (Wasmann) are economically important structural pests in urban areas. Due to anthropogenic activity, both species have been introduced into the United States, with their respective invasive ranges now overlapping in Florida, and the two species have the capability to hybridize. The potential for structural damage from subterranean termite colonies primarily depends on colony size. However, long-term colony growth and wood consumption capabilities of hybrid Coptotermes colonies remain to be investigated, to determine the potential pest status of field-established hybrid colonies. In this study, we investigated long-term colony development over four years to determine if aging hybrid colonies display vigor in terms of colony growth. In addition, we compared wood consumption rate of hybrid colonies to compare their potential impact as structural pests with the two parental species. In aging colonies (four-year-old), both hybrid mating types displayed a colony growth equivalent to C. formosanus. However, the wood consumption rates of four-year-old colonies of the two parental Coptotermes species and their hybrids were similar, indicating equal damaging potential. We also found multiple secondary reproductives in hybrid colonies, even in the presence of primary reproductives, which may favor their potential establishment and spread. Although hybrid colonies or hybrid alates have yet to be detected in the field, our results suggest that such hybrid colonies would be an additional termite threat in the future if they were established in the field.

AB  - Introduction: Variants in GATOR1 genes are well established in focal epilepsy syndromes. A strong asso-ciation of GATOR1 variants with drug-resistant epilepsy as well as an increased risk of sudden unex-plained death in epilepsy warrants developing strategies to facilitate the identification of patients who could potentially benefit from genetic testing and precision medicine. We aimed to determine the yield of GATOR1 gene sequencing in patients with focal epilepsy typically referred for genetic testing, establish novel GATOR1 variants and determine clinical, electroencephalographic, and radiological characteristics of variant carriers. Patients and Methods: Ninety-six patients with clinical suspicion of genetic focal epilepsy with previous comprehensive diagnostic epilepsy evaluation in The Neurology Clinic, University Clinical Center of Serbia, were included in the study. Sequencing was performed using a custom gene panel encompassing DEPDC5, NPRL2, and NPRL3. Variants of interest (VOI) were classified according to criteria proposed by the American College of Medical Genetics and the Association for Molecular Pathology. Results: Four previously unreported VOI in 4/96 (4.2%) patients were found in our cohort. Three likely pathogenic variants were determined in 3/96 (3.1%) patients, one frameshift variant in DEPDC5 in a patient with nonlesional frontal lobe epilepsy, one splicogenic DEPDC5 variant in a patient with nonle-sional posterior quadrant epilepsy, and one frameshift variant in NPRL2 in a patient with temporal lobe epilepsy associated with hippocampal sclerosis. Only one VOI, a missense variant in NPRL3, found in 1/96 (1.1%) patients, was classified as a variant of unknown significance. Conclusion: GATOR1 gene sequencing was diagnostic in 3.1% of our cohort and revealed three novel likely pathogenic variants, including a previously unreported association of temporal lobe epilepsy with hip-pocampal sclerosis with an NPRL2 variant. Further research is essential for a better understanding of the clinical scope of GATOR1 gene-associated epilepsy.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction Traumatic brain injury is the leading cause of death and disability in individuals under 40 years old. It induces various neuropathological outcomes, including cognitive, emotional, and physiological deficits, likely linked to early neuroinflammatory processes. In an animal model, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has been shown to elevate oxidative stress biomarkers, such as advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and malondialdehyde (MDA), which persist for over a week. Despite extensive research on anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective therapies, most preclinical and clinical studies report limited efficacy. Synthetic glucocorticoids offer potential for early treatment of TBI-induced neuroinflammation, but clinical use is hindered by adverse effects and poor central nervous system biodistribution. Triamcinolone possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and microglial inhibitory properties, although it has poor solubility and limited blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) may enhance TR solubility, bioavailability, BBB permeation, and intracellular delivery. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of triamcinolone-loaded LNCs (NT) on oxidative stress and cognitive-emotional outcomes following mTBI.Methods Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to closed-head mTBI via a 45 g weight-drop method, under anesthesia. Animals received NT, conventional triamcinolone, or empty LNCs, 15 minutes and 24 hours post-injury. They were sacrificed 24 hours, 1 or 7 days later for biochemical analysis of AOPP, MDA, and antioxidant enzymes (catalase and superoxide dismutase) activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal, and motor cortices. Separate cohorts underwent behavioral tests assessing memory (novel object recognition, Y-maze, and fear conditioning), 7 days after mTBI.Results mTBI induced significant impairments in recognition memory and fear retention, as well as increased AOPP, MDA, and CAT activity. SOD levels peaked at 24 h and normalized by day 7. NT, but not conventional TR, effectively prevented behavioral deficits and normalized OS markers. Importantly, early NT treatment reduced CAT overactivation at 7 days.Discussion This study provides the first evidence of the efficacy of NT in mitigating cognitive and emotional sequelae following mTBI, likely through enhanced brain delivery and early modulation of oxidative stress pathways.

AB  - Introduction: Ischemic conditionings (ICon) were intensively investigated and several protective signaling pathways were identified. Previously, we have shown the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) and the cardioprotective role of biglycan (BGN), a small leucine-rich proteoglycan in vitro. Here, we hypothesized that cardiac MMP and BGN signaling are involved in the protective effects of ICon. Methods: A reverse target-microRNA prediction was performed by using the miRNAtarget (TM) 2.0 software to identify human microRNAs with a possible regulatory effect on MMP and BGN, such as on related genes. To validate the identified 1289 miRNAs in the predicted network, we compared them to two cardioprotective miRNA omics datasets derived from pig and rat models of MIRI in the presence of ICons. Results: Among the experimentally measured miRNAs, we found 100% sequence identity to human predicted regulatory miRNAs in the case of 37 porcine and 24 rat miRNAs. Upon further analysis, 42 miRNAs were identified as MIRI-associated miRNAs, from which 24 miRNAs were counter-regulated due to ICons. Conclusions: Our findings highlight 24 miRNAs that potentially regulate cardioprotective therapeutic targets associated with MMPs and BGN in a highly translatable porcine model of acute myocardial infarction.

AB  - The cotton mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) is a polyphagous invasive species native to America and considered one of the major cotton pests in Asia. It is currently threatening horticultural and ornamental protected crops in Mediterranean countries. Due to ecological and environmental concerns, the conventional chemical control of P. solenopsis in new areas of introduction is being replaced by exploring the potential of indigenous natural enemies as a sustainable biological control tool. After P. solenopsis introduction in Sicily (Italy), field surveys were conducted on native natural enemies attacking the mealybug to select promising biocontrol agents for field applications. For the first time, Aenasius arizonensis (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) was reported in Europe, and the native Anagyrus matritensis (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) was recorded in association with P. solenopsis. The two parasitoid species were identified by morphological features and molecularly using a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) gene. Because of missing information, additional morphological features were provided for the morphological identification of A. matritensis. In addition, the generalist predators Cryptolaemus montrouzieri, Hippodamia variegata and Parexochomus nigripennis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) were also recorded attacking the invasive mealybug.

AB  - The wheat midge, Sitodiplosis mosellana (G & eacute;hin) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), poses a threat to spring wheat in North America. Larvae feed on the developing kernels, causing decreased grain quality and yield loss. The resistance gene Sm1, a single, naturally occurring gene that results in larval mortality, is important for managing this pest. However, relying on a single resistance gene may result in the evolution of virulent pest biotypes. To identify possible alternative mechanisms of resistance, mechanical deterrence against wheat midge oviposition was evaluated using doubled haploid spring wheat lines (DH lines) with different combinations of awns and hairy glumes. Adult wheat midges were introduced to cages containing 12 preanthesis wheat spikes consisting of combinations of the presence or absence of awns with either hairy or smooth glumes, and oviposition on these phenotypes was recorded. In addition, kernel damage of five lines per phenotype was assessed under field conditions. The presence of awns on wheat spikes reduced oviposition in the laboratory choice cages, but not all wheat lines with awns reduced damage in the field. Hairy glumes did not reduce midge oviposition or grain damage. Independent of the awned and hairy-glumed phenotypes, egg numbers and damage varied among the DH lines. Four wheat lines exhibited wheat midge deterrence and are promising candidates as sources of novel resistance to combine with Sm1 to pyramid resistance.

AB  - Numerous species of adventive aphids in Japan exhibit a strong association with naturalized plants, making the aphid studies on such plants crucial for the early detection of newly introduced species. During 2017-2018 and 2023-2024, we examined the aphids occurring on a naturalized plant, Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link (Fabaceae) in Japan, documenting the occurrence of a new adventive species, Ctenocallis setosa (Kaltenbach, 1846) in the country. This represents the first record of this species also from Asia, as it is native to Europe and had previously been adventive only in North America. This paper provides the photographs and morphological redescriptions of its viviparae (apterous and alate) and sexuals (oviparae and alate males). The findings from this field study suggest that this species exhibits a monoecious holocyclic life cycle in Japan, characterized by the sexual morph production for laying overwintering eggs in fall and the absence of host alternation during summer.

AB  - New infestations of the Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae), were discovered in southern California, namely in Rancho Santa Fe and La Mesa (San Diego County) and Highland Park (Los Angeles County) in 2021. We investigated whether these new infestations were related to the previous infestations in La Mesa (2018) and Canyon Lake, Riverside County (2020). We used two mitochondrial genes (COI and COII) and seven polymorphic microsatellite markers to infer the genetic relationship between southern California colonies and their breeding systems. The samples collected from seven localities belonged to five colonies (inter-colony distances ranged from similar to 160 m to 185 km, with an average of 97 km). Of these five colonies, two were simple families, and three were extended families. Structure analyses of microsatellite genotypes grouped the termite samples into three distinct genetic clusters, suggesting at least three independent introduction events in southern California.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The aim of the current study was to establish an osseo-disintegration model initiated with a single microorganism in mini-pigs. Materials and Methods: A total of 36 titanium dental implants (3.5 mm in diameter, 9.5 mm in length) was inserted into frontal bone (n: 12) and the basis of the corpus mandible (n: 24). Eighteen implants were contaminated via inoculation of Enterococcus faecalis. Six weeks after implant insertion, bone-to-implant contact (BIC) ratio, interthread bone density (ITBD), and peri-implant bone density (PIBD) were examined. In addition to that, new bone formation was assessed via fluorescence microscopy, histomorphometry, and light microscopical examinations. Results: Compared to the sterile implants, the contaminated implants showed significantly reduced BIC (p < 0.001), ITBD (p < 0.001), and PBD (p < 0.001) values. Around the sterile implants, the green and red fluorophores were overlapping and surrounding the implant without gaps, indicating healthy bone growth on the implant surface, whereas contaminated implants were surrounded by connective tissue. Conclusions: The current experimental model could be a feasible option to realize a significant alteration of dental-implant osseointegration and examine novel surface decontamination techniques without impairing local and systemic inflammatory complications.

AB  - As the development and use of living modified organisms (LMOs) steadily increase, new risk assessment methods that reflect domestic natural ecosystems are being developed. Although LM plants are fundamentally necessary for environmental risk assessment, the introduced gene products and LMO proteins can replace transgenic plants. However, their use is problematic because of instability and indirect assessment data issues. This study proposes a risk assessment tool and scheme for introducing LMO proteins into genetically modified crops. The agroinfiltration method for transient LMO gene expression in plants is a practical tool which can be used to rapidly verify the putative risks of LMO proteins against insects using an LM crop mimic plant with a stably expressed LMO protein. This study used Nicotiana tabacum leaves, which transiently but stably expressed the insecticidal LMO protein Vip3Aa, for LMO risk assessments against Spodoptera litura. The Vip3Aa protein was stably expressed for 5 d in the agroinfiltrated plants, and the protein was active against target insects for environmental LMO risk assessments. In the toxicity evaluation of Vip3Aa-expressing plants against S. litura, the number of deaths was higher in the Vip3Aa-infiltrated N. tabacum-fed group than that in the recombinant Vip3Aa-fed group. In addition, the cumulative number of deaths in the infiltration leaf-fed group was approximately 12-fold higher than that in the protein-fed group under low dosage conditions. This study aimed to develop a transient expression model which can be used to evaluate whether the overall risk of LMO protein is acceptable for use. These results support the usefulness of the transient expression model using an agroinfiltration method as a rapid risk validation tool for LMO proteins against herbivorous insects before producing transgenic plants.

AB  - Introduction: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) represent molecules of great interest in the field of regenerative biology since several animal models require their production to promote and favor tissue, organ, and appendage regeneration. Recently, it has been shown that the production of ROS such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is required for tail regeneration in Ambystoma mexicanum. However, to date, it is unknown whether ROS production is necessary for limb regeneration in this animal model. Methods: forelimbs of juvenile animals were amputated proximally and the dynamics of ROS production was determined using 2 & PRIME;7- dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) during the regeneration process. Inhibition of ROS production was performed using the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin. Subsequently, a rescue assay was performed using exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The effect of these treatments on the size and skeletal structures of the regenerated limb was evaluated by staining with alcian blue and alizarin red, as well as the effect on blastema formation, cell proliferation, immune cell recruitment, and expression of genes related to proximal-distal identity. Results: our results show that inhibition of post-amputation limb ROS production in the A. mexicanum salamander model results in the regeneration of a miniature limb with a significant reduction in the size of skeletal elements such as the ulna, radius, and overall autopod. Additionally, other effects such as decrease in the number of carpals, defective joint morphology, and failure of integrity between the regenerated structure and the remaining tissue were identified. In addition, this treatment affected blastema formation and induced a reduction in the levels of cell proliferation in this structure, as well as a reduction in the number of CD45(+) and CD11b + immune system cells. On the other hand, blocking ROS production affected the expression of proximo-distal identity genes such as Aldha1a1, Rar beta, Prod1, Meis1, Hoxa13, and other genes such as Agr2 and Yap1 in early/mid blastema. Of great interest, the failure in blastema formation, skeletal alterations, as well as the expression of the genes evaluated were rescued by the application of exogenous H2O2, suggesting that ROS/H2O2 production is necessary from the early stages for proper regeneration and patterning of the limb.

AB  - We present a novel application using unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS; drones) for structure-from-motion three-dimensional (3-D) photogrammetry of multiple, free-living animals simultaneously. Pinnipeds reliably haul out on shore for pupping and breeding each year, accompanied by dramatic female-to-pup mass transfer over a short lactation period and males lose mass while defending mating territories. This provides a tractable study system for validating the use of UAS as a non-invasive tool for tracking energy dynamics in wild populations. UAS imagery of grey seals Halichoerus grypus was collected at Saddle Island, Nova Scotia. A multirotor UAS was piloted in 360-degree orbits around relatively dense animal aggregations and georeferenced images were used for construction of a 3-D point cloud, orthomosaic and Digital Surface Model for animal volumetric measurements. Directly following UAS survey, a subset of adult females were hand-measured (morphometrics, blubber depth, n = 21 handlings [15 were unique animals]) and female-pup pairs were weighed (adult females: n = 32 [24]; pups: n = 33 [23]) to validate that UAS 3-D photogrammetric models provided accurate animal volume and mass estimates. UAS two-dimensional body length measurements were sensitive to animal recumbency and posture. The new UAS 3-D photogrammetric method overcame these constraints, and aerial-derived body volume measurements were equivalent to those collected from the ground. UAS body volume measurements precisely predicted 'true' body mass (mean absolute error, adult female: 3.8 kg, 2.1% body mass; pup: 4.1 kg, 9.8%), and exhibited a stronger relationship with total body mass than with blubber volume. The method was applied to 673 free-living animals to characterize volume and mass dynamics across lactation and breeding for a much larger sample size than would be possible using traditional ground methods. Indeed, 1-46 animals (M +/- SE: 9.2 +/- 1.2) were modelled concurrently within the focal area of a UAS flight. Application of the method also captured significant inter-annual variation in body volume/mass dynamics, and female-to-pup energy transfer efficiencies were lower when there was low sea ice extent. The UAS 3-D photogrammetric method presented in this study is likely to be broadly applicable to other species, and the ability to measure whole groups of free-living animals at once makes strides towards 'weighing populations'.

AB  - Providing mankind with high-quality products of aquaculture is possible only by introduction of modern industrial technologies to fish farming, growing fish based on modern scientific achievements. Assessment of the ecotoxic situation and identification of impacts of various unfavourable factors of aquatic environment on aquatic organisms should be made through morphological studies of the organs that are first to encounter the impact. The study revealed species specifics of the morphology of the liver of the fishes of the Cyprinidae family - Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio), Eurasian carp (Cyprinus carpio), and bighead carp (Hypoph-thalmichthys nobilis), which vary by extent of the motor activity in the aquatic environment, nutrition, etc. We determined that during phylogenetic development of fish that grow in the aquatic environment, there occurs a certain restructuring of the liver: the adaptation to various living conditions were accompanied by changes in a number of parameters of macro-and microscopic architectonics of the liver. Cyprinus carpio and Carassius gibelio (omnivores) have a two-lobe liver, while Hypophthalmichthys nobilis herbivore) has a three-lobe liver. For C. carpio andH. nobilis, a characteristic feature of the liver was presence of the hepatopancreatitis (the liver and the pancreas, associated into a single organ), and in C. gibelio, they are differentiated into individual organs. A peculiarity of the microscopic structure of the liver of the Cyprinidae family is poorly developed interlobular connective tissue, and parenchyma of the liver lobule has a tubular structure as polyhedral, curved thick-walled tubules, the walls of which are hepatocytes. The greatest amounts of cytoplasm and karyoplasms were seen in C. gibelio, equaling respectively 12.98 +/- 1.42 and 0.40 0.02 mu m3. The lowest volume of the indicated parameters was in C. carpio, particularly 2.97 +/- 0.22 and 0.21 +/- 0.01 mu m3, respectively. The lowest nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio was observed in hepatocytes of C. gibelio (0.0316 +/- 0.0024). The conducted morphological studies at the levels of organs, tissues and cells can reveal how the fishes' bodies adapt to particular living conditions and impacts of environmental factors.

AB  - Introduction: The utilization of organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) has been demonstrated to exert a substantial positive influence on crop yield enhancement. However, due to the multitude of exposure routes and the persistence of these compounds, humans are routinely exposed to pesticides on a daily basis through dermal contact, inhalation, and ingestion. This has serious consequences for the health of living organisms. The existing research on the effects of organophosphorus pesticides on organisms primarily encompasses the impact on vital organs such as the liver, kidneys, heart, various blood parameters, and potential neurotoxicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity, and mutagenic effects. However, there is a paucity of research addressing the alleviation of brain tissue damage in OP pesticide poisoning through the microbial-intestinal-brain axis. Objectives: The objective of the present study is to illuminate the biological activity and mechanism of ginsenoside Rg3 in addressing brain injury induced by chlorpyrifos, employing both in vivo and in vitro models. This investigation will elucidate the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and the polarization of macrophages in this process. Methods and results: Ginsenoside Rg3 is characterized by notable antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. The results showed that Rg3 improved the cognitive and learning memory impairment after chlorpyrifos (CPF) exposure in C57 mice, alleviated macrophage infiltration in the hippocampus, repaired synaptic ultrastructural damage and restored the absence of synapse-related proteins (BDNF, SYP, and PSD-95) through behavioral assays, ameliorated neuronal apoptosis and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) disorders, and mediated the development of MPA axis disorders, while mediating M1/M2 macrophage polarization and attenuating apoptosis in brain tissue. In intestinal tissues, Rg3 improved the intestinal flora of mice, significantly reduced macrophage infiltration, and down-regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6), while concurrently augmenting the levels of short-chain fatty acids. And the therapeutic role of Rg3 in ameliorating the brain damage induced by chlorpyrifos exposure was substantiated by protein imprinting through the NLRP3/Caspase-1/IL-1 beta signaling pathway. Meanwhile, the results of in vitro experiments demonstrated that ginsenoside Rg3 could attenuate CPF-induced inflammatory responses in BV-2 microglia by modulating M1/M2 macrophage polarization. Conclusion: The results of this study confirmed that ginsenoside Rg3 can be utilized as a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate brain tissue damage resulting from OP-type pesticide poisoning. These findings suggest that Rg3 has the potential to serve as a promising clinical drug for the treatment of organs affected by organophosphorus pesticide poisoning. This study offers novel insights into the application of Rg3 in the context of the microbial-gut-brain axis, providing a theoretical foundation for the development of ginsenoside Rg3 in clinical settings and the future development of novel drugs.

AB  - Prenatal maternal stress negatively impacts maternal mental health and mother-child interaction, potentially increasing the risk of developmental outcomes in offspring. While studies in humans and lab animals have established these associations, the underlying mechanisms in naturalistic settings, where stressors are dynamic and interspecies differences may emerge, remain poorly characterized. This study introduced a novel model system using wild Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) to investigate the effects of maternal depression-like psychopathology on offspring mood, cognition, and brain development. This model involves the repeated exposure of pregnant voles to predator odors, a natural stressor, which induces a depression-like state from late pregnancy to the early postpartum period. This model integrates ecologically relevant stressors with neurobehavioral assessments in a wild-derived species, allowing for a mechanistic investigation in a biologically meaningful context. We found that while exposure to predator odor stress during pregnancy induced maternal depressive-like states, it did not alter the level of postnatal parent-offspring interaction. Offspring born to mothers exposed to predator odor during pregnancy exhibited increased anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, impaired spatial and social cognition, and reduced sociability compared to offspring of mothers exposed to distilled water. These offspring also showed reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, along with decreased dendrite branching and spine density. Our findings suggest that the effects of depression-like states during pregnancy and postpartum in female Brandt's voles on offspring brain and behavioral functions occur independently of parent-offspring interactions, with hippocampal structural and functional abnormalities potentially mediating behavioral deficits. Importantly, this work establishes Brandt's voles as a new, ecologically valid animal model for studying gestational depression and its intergenerational outcomes, bridging the gap between laboratory rodent studies and natural behavioral contexts.

AB  - Doxorubicin (Dox) is not a first-line treatment for melanoma due to limited antitumor efficacy and dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. However, sublethal doses may trigger adaptive cellular responses that influence tumor progression and systemic toxicity. Small extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key mediators of intercellular communication and can carry bioactive molecules that modulate both the tumor microenvironment and distant tissues. This study investigates how sublethal Dox exposure alters EV biogenesis and cargo in A375 melanoma cells and explores the potential implications for cardiovascular function. We treated human A375 melanoma cells with 10 nM dox for 96 h. EVs were isolated using differential ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography. Vesicle characterization included Immunocytochemistry for CD63, CD81, CD9, Rab7 and TSG101, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), and Western blotting for CD81 and CytC. We analyzed cytokine content using cytokine membrane arrays. Guinea pig cardiomyocytes were exposed to the isolated vesicles, and mitochondrial activity was evaluated using the MTT assay. Statistical analysis included t-tests, ANOVA, Cohen's d, and R2 and eta 2. Dox exposure significantly increased EV production (13.6-fold; p = 0.000014) and shifted vesicle size distribution. CD81 expression was significantly upregulated (p = 0.0083), and SEM (microscopy) confirmed enhanced vesiculation. EVs from treated cells were enriched in TGF-beta (p = 0.0134), VEGF, CXCL1, CXCL12, CCL5, IL-3, IL-4, IL-10, Galectin-3, and KITLG. Cardiomyocytes exposed to these vesicles showed a 2.3-fold reduction in mitochondrial activity (p = 0.0021), an effect absent when vesicles were removed. Bioinformatic analysis linked EV cargo to pathways involved in cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation, and fibrosis. As conclusion, sublethal Doxorubicin reprograms melanoma-derived EVs by enhancing their production and enriching their cargo with profibrotic and immunomodulatory mediators.

AB  - The measurement of the enterovirus and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in sewage water is relevant in the early detection of the introduction or disappearance of these viruses in the ecosystem. We evaluated the co-circulation of the enteroviruses and SARS-CoV-2 in 81 sewage water samples collected between September 2021 and April 2023 from different regions of north and southeast Romania, at the border with Ukraine. We used, for the molecular detection of the pathogens, the multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay produced for respiratory samples and the Respiratory 2.1 Plus panel Biofire Film array. The isolation of enteroviruses was performed on cell culture lines, in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. By molecular investigations, we detected the SARS-CoV-2 in 22 (27%) samples, and the human rhinovirus/enterovirus in 64 (79%) samples. By isolation on cell culture lines, 27 samples (33,33%) were positive for non-polio enteroviruses, and no poliovirus strains were isolated, proving the maintenance of the polio-free status in Romania. In an emergency situation, the molecular detection of the pathogens in sewage water using a PCR system integrating sample preparation, amplification, detection, and analysis in 1 h could be implemented.

AB  - Tea is the first most popular beverage worldwide and is available in several selections such as black (fully oxidized), Oolong (partially oxidized) and green (non-oxidized), in addition to purple tea, an emerging variety derived from the same tea plant (Camellia sinensis). This study investigated purple tea leaves (non-oxidized) and flakes (water extractable) to thoroughly identify their composition of anthocyanins and catechins and to study the effect of a water extraction process on their compositional properties in comparison with green tea. Anthocyanin and catechin compounds were separated and quantified using UPLC, and their identity was confirmed using LC-MS/MS in positive and negative ionization modes. Delphinidin was the principal anthocyaninidin in purple tea, while cyanidin came in second. The major anthocyanin pigments in purple tea were delphinidin-coumaroyl-hexoside followed by delphinidin-3-galactoside and cyanidin-coumaroyl-hexoside. The water extraction process resulted in substantial reductions in anthocyanins in purple tea flakes. There were no anthocyanin compounds detected in green tea samples. Both purple and green tea types were rich in catechins, with green tea containing higher concentrations than purple tea. The main catechin in purple or green tea was epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) followed by either epicatechin gallate (ECG) or epigallocatechin (EGC), subject to tea type. The extraction process increased the concentration of catechins in both purple and green tea flakes. The results suggest that purple tea holds promise in making healthy brews, natural colorants and antioxidants and/or functional ingredients for beverages, cosmetics and healthcare industries due to its high content of anthocyanins and catechins.

AB  - IntroductionVarious herbivorous insects prefer toxic plants as their hosts, although this may appear paradoxical. They have evolved specific adaptations (called counter-defenses) against the toxins. For example, the two-component chemical defense system of plants of the Brassicaceae family against herbivores consists of glucosinolates (GLSs) and the activating enzyme myrosinase. GLS hydrolysis by myrosinase leads to isothiocyanates (ITCs), which are toxic and deterrent to many insect herbivores. Two different types of counter-defenses can be distinguished: a preemptive counter-defense that prevents the GLSs from being hydrolyzed to ITCs due to metabolic redirection and direct counter-defense, where the ITCs are formed but then metabolized to non-toxic conjugates. In general, preemptive counter-defense is only a possibility if the plant stores a precursor of the toxin, which is activated upon attack. Preemptive counter-defense is believed to be more efficient due to the lower exposure to ITCs, but this has not been satisfactorily demonstrated experimentally.MethodsHere, we derive on theoretical grounds the conditions under which preemptive counter-defense reduces exposure to ITCs compared to direct counter-defense by studying the dynamics of GLS defense and counter-defense with two separate ordinary differential equation models. We model how herbivory transfers the GLSs to the insect gut with the leaf material. Thereafter, we describe the insects' exposure to toxins by deriving the dynamics of ITCs in the gut during feeding with the two types of counter-defenses.Results and discussionBy calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the ITC concentrations, we show, based on empirical data, that herbivores with a preemptive detoxification system are usually less exposed to ITCs. In addition, our models explain how the decline in the level of ITCs is achieved by both counter-defenses, which helps to understand the overall mechanisms and benefits of these techniques. Our results may also apply to plant defenses by inactive toxin precursors other than GLSs as well as to insects that sequester such precursors for their own defense.

AB  - IntroductionPerennial Chinese licorice, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, is an important medicinal plant. Diorhabda tarsalis, a leaf beetle, is a serious insect pest on the plant and cause serious yield losses every year and is attracted to healthy and pest-damaged licorice by plant volatiles. AimThe biologically active components of the volatiles released from G. uralensis have not been reported; the components of the volatiles that attract D. tarsalis need to be identified. Such compounds could potentially be used for monitoring and mass-trapping pests. MethodsGC-EAD, GC-MS, EAG, Y-shaped olfactometer behavioral bioassays, and field trials were performed to identify the components and composition of active volatiles. ResultsMale and virgin female adults were generally attracted to volatiles from licorice, and volatiles from pest-infested plants were more attractive. Four compounds from licorice elicited a significant electrophysiological response (EAD) and were confirmed by EAG, including hexanal, (Z)-3-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, and (E)-2-hexenal. With the exception of the (E)-2-hexenal, these molecules significantly attracted adults in individual behavioral bioassays, and a proportional mixture corresponding to beetle-damaged licorice of hexanal, (Z)-3-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, and (E)-2-hexenal (8.78:15.26:57.24:18.72) was most effective for attracting D. tarsalis in the field, attracted a mean of 26 +/- 7.19 beetles per trap. DiscussionD. tarsalis was attracted to volatiles from healthy and herbivore-induced G. uralensis under both laboratory and field conditions. The aforementioned compounds show considerable potential for commercial application to monitor and control D. tarsalis populations.

AB  - Cats (Felis catus) kill millions of native Australian mammals and birds each year. The prey naivety hypothesis suggests this is due to native wildlife failing to recognise cats as predators. The Mata Hari Judas (MHJ) queen technique, where confined female cats are put into prolonged oestrus, has recently been trialled in situ as a method to attract and capture feral cats. This created the opportunity to observe how native wildlife respond to a live cat, or their olfactory and auditory cues, using camera trap detections before and after the introduction of a MHJ queen or its cues. Daily detection rates of eastern grey kangaroos, Australian magpies, noisy miners and northern brown bandicoots around the live cat did not differ between baseline and live cat periods, suggesting these species may not recognise live cats as a threat. However, red-necked wallabies and grey butcherbirds reduced activity in response to live cats or their cues. This study demonstrates that native Australian wildlife exhibit variable behavioural responses to cats and their cues. As predator control strategies evolve, integrating behavioural ecology into their design will be critical for their effectiveness, such as prioritising species that lack predator awareness.

AB  - Understanding the circumstances under which insect herbivores will adopt a novel host plant is a longstanding question in basic and applied ecology. While geographic variation in host use can arise through differences in both herbivore preference and plant characteristics, there is a tendency to attribute geographic variation in host use to regional differences in herbivore preference alone. This is especially true for herbivores specialized to one or a few plant species. We compared how geographic variation in herbivore preference and host plant origin shape regional differences in host plant use by the specialized herbivore, Euphydryas phaeton. In parts of its range, E. phaeton uses only a native host, Chelone glabra, while in others, it also uses an introduced host, Plantago lanceolata. We offered female butterflies from each region the non-native host plant sourced from both regions and compared their oviposition behavior. The non-native host was almost universally rejected by butterflies in the region where only the native plant is used. In the region where butterflies use both hosts, females accepted non-native plants from their natal region twice as often as non-native plants from the other region where they are not used. Acceptance differed substantially among individual butterflies within regions but not among plants within regions. Thus, both individual preference and regional differences in both the insect and non-native host contributed to the geographic variation in different ways. These results highlight that, in addition to herbivore preference, regional differences in perceived plant suitability may be an important driver of diet breadth.

AB  - Conflict mitigation strategies reduce losses caused by wildlife crop depredations, yet farmers often choose to use techniques that are not very effective or not to use strategies at all. We conducted a study in Himachal Pradesh in northern India to understand what factors drive farmers to adopt certain mitigation strategies against crop-foraging rhesus macaques. We employed an action-research approach and tested the effectiveness of four physical deterrents, two chemical repellents, three acoustic repellents, and two psychological techniques in preventing monkeys from entering crop fields. We conducted the deterrent trials on farm plots that farmers had temporarily abandoned due to primate crop-foraging. The number of available plots and their location restricted our ability to conduct replicate deterrent trials. We also interviewed 70 farmers before and after the deterrent trials to understand their willingness to try nonlethal techniques to deter crop-foraging monkeys. Simple fences using locally available materials successfully reduced primate depredations, and farmers agreed to adopt these techniques. However, a stated willingness to adopt new strategies may not translate to actual implementation, because farmers' use of mitigation strategies is a complex behavior influenced by various factors. Also, the lack of trial replication affected our ability to confirm our results. Determining whether researchers can apply our findings to a wider population requires additional research. Addressing changes in human behavior and attitudes toward mitigation strategies is critical for implementing regionally effective nonlethal mitigation strategies.

AB  - Magnesium alloys have gained popularity in orthopedic implants due to their excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, which eliminates the need for secondary surgeries for removal. However, uncontrolled rapid degradation of most magnesium alloys can lead to early failure of implants with unexpected accumulation of gas, disturbing regeneration of surrounding tissues. In this article, we introduce new Mg-Zn-Zr-Mn magnesium alloys with biocompatible elements in low concentrations, which can form single-phase alloy and diminish corrosion due to galvanic corrosion due to multiple phases. These alloys also demonstrated outstanding mechanical properties with tensile strength of 332 MPa and excellent biocompatibility. Degradation tests were conducted in vitro by electrochemical tests and measuring mass loss and hydrogen gas released, and nearly constant degradation behavior was observed. In vivo degradation experiments were done using goats as models, and long-term observation demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and controlled degradation pattern of our new Mg alloys. Our results provided insights into the in vitro and in vivo performance of our new Mg alloys, and they can be highly promising for widespread use in orthopedic implants.

AB  - Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) is involved in the pathogenesis of acne by inducing inflammation and biofilm formation, along with other virulence factors. A Camellia sinensis (C. sinensis) callus lysate is proposed to reduce these effects. The aim of the present work is to study the anti-inflammatory properties of a callus extract from C. sinensis on C. acnes-stimulated human keratinocytes and the quorum-quenching activities. Keratinocytes were stimulated with thermo-inactivated pathogenic C. acnes and were treated with the herbal lysate (0.25% w/w) to evaluate its anti-inflammatory effect. C. acnes biofilm was developed in vitro and treated with 2.5 and 5% w/w of the lysate to evaluate quorum sensing and the lipase activity. The results showed that the lysate was able to reduce the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), and decrease the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-?B). The lysate did not show bactericidal activity but showed diminished biofilm formation, the lipase activity, and the production of autoinducer 2 (AI-2), a member of a family of signaling molecules used in quorum sensing. Therefore, the proposed callus lysate could have the potential to reduce acne-related symptoms without the eradication of C. acnes, which is part of the natural skin microbiome.

AB  - When biomedical research investigates the human surgical situation in the need of a chronic course, it is more often possible to do so using large animal models. The use of farm animals always poses special challenges for the institution conducting the research in terms of infection prevention and occupational safety. Especially for the zoonotic disease coxiellosis it is important to be aware of the constant risk of pathogen introduction by small ruminants and to take appropriate precautions. In this way, personal injury should be avoided or at least be kept to a minimum in the event of infection since then sustainable zoonosis control can be immediately initiated. Using the example of a Q fever outbreak at a research facility, we want to share with this extended case report the importance of central emergency structures, provisions and the inclusion of relevant experts and disciplines in a crisis team. Its primary purpose is to support the affected facility and coordinate the implementation of necessary cleaning, disinfection and decontamination measures in close contact with the responsible local authorities. The aim is to inactivate the pathogen in a systematic and controlled manner in few steps of action only and to keep the interruption of the facility's operations as short as possible.

   Wenn in der biomedizinischen Forschung der chronische Verlauf eines chirurgischen Eingriffs am Menschen untersucht werden soll, ist daf & uuml;r haeufig das Gro ss tiermodell besonders geeignet. Die Verwendung von landwirtschafltichen Nutztieren stellt eine Forschungseinrichtung in Bezug auf Infektionspr & auml;vention und Arbeitssicherheit stets vor besondere Herausforderungen. Insbesondere bei der Zoonose Coxiellosis ist es wichtig, sich des st & auml;ndigen Risikos einer Erregereinschleppung durch kleine Wiederk & auml;uer bewusst zu sein und entsprechende Schutzma ss nahmen zu treffen. Nur so k & ouml;nnen Personensch & auml;den im Falle einer Infektion vermieden oder zumindest so gering wie m & ouml;glich gehalten werden, da dann sofort eine nachhaltige Zoonosenbek & auml;mpfung eingeleitet werden kann. Am Beispiel eines Q-Fieber-Ausbruchs in einer Forschungseinrichtung wollen wir mit diesem eingehenden Fallbericht die Bedeutung zentraler Notfallstrukturen, Vorkehrungen und die Einbeziehung einschl & auml;giger Experten und Disziplinen in einen Krisenstab aufzeigen. Dessen prim & auml;re Aufgabe ist es, die betroffene Einrichtung zu unterst & uuml;tzen und die Durchf & uuml;hrung der notwendigen Reinigungs-, Desinfektions- und Dekontaminationsma ss nahmen in engem Kontakt mit den zust & auml;ndigen & ouml;rtlichen Beh & ouml;rden zu koordinieren. Ziel ist es, den Erreger systematisch und kontrolliert in nur wenigen Handlungsschritten zu inaktivieren und die Betriebsunterbrechung der Einrichtung so kurz wie m & ouml;glich zu halten.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VaD) has a serious impact on the patients' quality of life. Icariin (Ica) possesses neuroprotective potential for treating VaD, yet its oral bioavailability and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability remain challenges. This research introduced a PEG-PLGA-loaded chitosan hydrogel-based binary formulation tailored for intranasal delivery, enhancing the intracerebral delivery efficacy of neuroprotective agents. The formulation underwent optimization to facilitate BBB crossing, with examinations conducted on its particle size, morphology, drug-loading capacity, in vitro release, and biodistribution. Using the bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) rat model, the therapeutic efficacy of this binary formulation was assessed against chitosan hydrogel and PEG-PLGA nanoparticles loaded with Ica. Post-intranasal administration, enhanced cognitive function was evident in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) rats. Further mechanistic evaluations, utilizing immunohistochemistry (IHC), RT-PCR, and ELISA, revealed augmented transcription of synaptic plasticity-associated proteins like SYP and PSD-95, and a marked reduction in hippocampal inflammatory markers such as IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, highlighting the formulation's promise in alleviating cognitive impairment. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin related kinase B (TrkB) pathway was activated significantly in the binary formulation compared with the other two. Our study demonstrates that the intranasal application of chitosan hydrogel loaded with Ica-encapsulated PEG-PLGA could effectively deliver Ica into the brain and enhance its neuroprotective effect.

AB  - Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has emerged as a popular choice of material for many microfluidic and flexible sensing devices despite its inherent hydrophobic nature. Here, we report on the use of atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge (APDBD) oxygen (O-2) plasma in the development of hydrophilic and protein repulsive PDMS microchannels for plasmonic sensing application. The effect of plasma treatment on the wettability, surface energy and hydrophilicity retention capacity of PDMS was determined using contact angle measurements. The PDMS sample exposed to low-power DBD O-2 plasma for 6 min demonstrated lowest contact angle of 35.15 & ring;, surface energy of 62.83 mN/m and hydrophilicity retention capacity of more than 50 days in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). The treatment of PDMS with plasma induces surface hydrophilicity due to the introduction of polar functional groups as evinced by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis without compromising the bulk structure and optical properties of PDMS which were confirmed by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) Spectroscopic measurements. The plasma treated PDMS was used in the construction of a microfluidic Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) biosensor which demonstrated very low detection limits of 7.13 ng/ml, 5.91 ng/ml and 1.47 ng/ml and high sensitivities of 16.8 & ring;/(mu g/ml), 13.5 & ring;/(mu g/ml) and 16.65 & ring;/(mu g/ml) against anti-Human Immunoglobulin-G protein raised in mouse, goat and rabbit respectively. The obtained results infer that APDBD O-2 plasma is a promising technique to render PDMS hydrophilic suited for reliable microfluidic based plasmonic biosensing applications.

AB  - The type specimens of 42 cheilostome bryozoan species introduced by Lars Silen between 1938 and 1954 and housed at three different Swedish institutions (the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm, the Biological Museum in Lund and the Museum of Evolution in Uppsala) are here revised using scanning electron microscopy, with two exceptions, for the first time. As a result of this revision, new morphological observations were made for some species, such as ooecia in Antropora erecta, a costal pseudopore in Jullienula hippocrepis, intracolonial variation in the number of intracostal windows in Costaticella gisleni, and oral spines in Triphyllozoon mauritzoni. Some other observations confirmed the presence of structures/polymorphs in type material that had previously only been noted in non-type specimens, such as spinose interzooidal kenozooids in Retevirgula triangulata and putative brooding zooids in Bugulina kiuschiuensis. Structures originally interpreted as hydroid tube openings on the dorsal side of Triphyllozoon microstigmatum were confirmed to be avicularia, while the supposed kenozooidal attachment rootlet of Fedora nodosa might be the polypide tube of a coronate scyphozoan. In addition, the original combination Heliodoma goesi is here reinstated after Lagaaij assigned the species to Setosellina in 1963. The following new combinations are also proposed: Labioporella aviculifera for Siphonoporella aviculifera; Mangana canui and Mangana incrustata for Callopora canui and Tegella incrustata, respectively; Sphaerulobryozoon ovum for Fedora ovum. Lectotypes were selected when appropriate. This work clarifies the exact identity of some species that have never been recorded after their first description, such as Stylopoma magnovicellata and three species of Triphyllozoon, and contributes to the current increasing effort to digitize historical key specimens in natural history museum collections.

AB  - Introduction: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and muscle development. Previous research identified miR-22-3p as being differentially regulated during muscle hypertrophy, and in vitro experiments found that antagomir-22-3p enhanced satellite cell proliferation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vivo vascular injection of antagomir-22-3p into the lateral saphenous vein and its effect on miRNA and histone deacetylase (HDAC) family mRNA expression in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) lambs. Methods: Pregnant ewes (n = 18) carrying twins were fed either 100% of NRC (CON) or were nutrient-restricted to 60% NRC (NR) from gestational d 86 until parturition. On d 12 of age, NR lambs (n = 8) were randomly selected and given a systemic injection of antagomir-22-3p (440 mu g/lamb) into the lateral saphenous vein of the right leg (NR-ANT22) for three consecutive days. CON lambs (n = 8) were also randomly selected and received a sham injection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) into the lateral saphenous vein of the right leg (CON-SHAM). Blood samples were collected from each lamb weekly to monitor circulating miR-22-3p expression. Muscle samples were collected 24 days post-injection to assess miR-22-3p levels and mRNA expression of potential miRNA targets. Results and discussion: Cell-free circulating miR-22-3p expression was more downregulated (P < 0.05) in NR-ANT22 lambs compared to that in CON-SHAM on d 14 after injection. On d 21 after injection, miR-22-3p expression in plasma tended to be more downregulated (P = 0.08) in NR-ANT22 compared to CON-SHAM. Lamb body weight and muscle weights at harvest were similar between the NR-ANT and CON- SHAM treatment groups. In the semitendinosus (ST) muscle, miR-22-3p expression was more downregulated (P < 0.05) in NR-ANT22_R ST (treated) lambs compared to that in NR-ANT22_L ST (non-treated) and CON-SHAM ST. In the heart and semimembranosus (SM) muscles, the expression of miR-22-3p was more downregulated (P < 0.05) in NR-ANT22 compared to that in CON-SHAM. In the gastrocnemius muscle, miR-22-3p expression remained unchanged (P > 0.05). The number of types I, IIa, and IIax muscle fibers were greater (P < 0.05) in NR-ANT22 lambs than those in CON-SHAM, whereas the number of type IIx fibers was greater (P < 0.05) in CON-SHAM lambs. NR-ANT22 treatment appears to promote a shift toward more oxidative muscle fiber metabolism. The systemic injection of antagomir-22-3p downregulated miR-22-3p expression in circulation and muscle tissues, which, in turn, altered the expression of HDAC/SIRT genes involved in muscle fiber type conversion and hypertrophy.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to develop reference values for haematological and biochemical vari-ables in the Canary camel breed (Camelus dromedarius). 114 clinically healthy dromedary camels were assessed. Age, sex, and pregnancy status was also recorded. The reference range for red blood cells (RBCs) was 8.45 - 13.65 X106/lL, haemoglobin (HGB) was 10.61 - 15.29 g/dL, packed cell volume (PCV) was 19.93 - 32.51 %, and white blood cells (WBCs) 7.35 - 18.36 X103/lL. A correlation was estab-lished between the haemoglobin concentration (HGB) (g/dl) and packed cell volume (PCV) obtaining a linear regression (HGB = 0.31 PCV + 4.67). Young animals had higher RBC and WBC values than adult ani-mals. Additionally, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), phosphorus, calcium, albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio, alka-line phosphatase, cholesterol, and lipase were higher in young animals compared with adults. Female dromedary camels showed higher values for the three main variables: RBC, HGB and PCV, but no differ-ences between sexes were detected in the biochemical variables results. The WBC count was higher in non-pregnant females than in pregnant animals. These results provide references values for the Canary camel breed and may contribute to the understanding of differences in 18 haematological and biochem-ical parameters in dromedary camels with a potential impact in health and welfare for this species.

AB  - The unpredictable nature of the loads and non-linearity of the components of microgrid systems make optimal scheduling more complex. In this paper, a deterministic optimal load-scheduling problem is developed for microgrids operating in both islanding and grid-connected mode under different energy scenarios. Various cases are considered in this research, based on the interaction and dynamic behavior of the microgrid, considering electric vehicles (EVs) in the scenario. The aim of this research is to minimize the overall cost of microgrid operations. The concept of dynamic pricing has also been introduced in order to optimize the energy cost for the consumers. For ensuring the stability of the microgrids, a load variance index has been considered, and the fuzzy-based approach has been used for cost and load variance minimization to reduce the operation cost without compromising the stability of the microgrid. The grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operations of EVs are integrated into the microgrid, which would help in valley filling and peak shaving of the loads during the off-peak and peak hours, respectively. In order to solve the proposed complex combinatorial optimization problem, elephant herding optimization (EHO) is modified and implemented. The performance of the proposed improved EHO (IEHO) is first tested on the latest CEC test functions. The results obtained by IEHO after 100 different trials are compared with the latest published methods and are found to be better based on the average value and the standard deviation for different CEC test functions. In addition, the simulation results obtained by particle swarm optimization (PSO), EHO, and proposed IEHO on a microgrid test system for different scenarios with all cases reveal that the proposed model with a mix of energy resources in the dynamic load dispatch environment bring the maximum benefits of microgrid systems. Furthermore, the results obtained from the simulation verifies that if free trade of power is allowed between the microgrids and the main grid, the process of power generation can be more economical, and further introduction of dynamic pricing into the scenario proves to be even cheaper. The implementation of the G2V and V2G operations of EVs operations in the proposed scenario not only helped in cost minimization but also helped in stabilizing the grid.

AB  - Astrocytes are ubiquitous in the brain and spinal cord and display a complex morphology important for the local interactions with neighboring cells, resulting in the modulation of circuit function. Thus, studies focusing on astrocyte physiology in the healthy and diseased brain generally present analyses of astrocytic structure. The labeling method used to visualize the astrocytic structure defines the morphological level to observe and may vary depending on the anatomical sub-regions. The method choice may significantly affect our understanding of their structural diversity. The main goal of this work was to identify a straightforward and efficient protocol for labeling and reconstructing a detailed astrocytic structure to apply and validate in different brain tissue preparations across laboratories. For that, we explored different tissue processing protocols before GFAP labeling to determine the most effective method for reconstructing astrocytic backbones in the mouse hippocampus. Our results show that the reconstruction of astrocytic structure in vibratome sections labeled by free-floating immunofluorescence protocol provides a more practical method to achieve a higher level of detail and arbor complexity in astrocyte backbone reconstruction. Free-floating immunofluorescence labeling is the most reliable method for obtaining better antibody penetration and more detailed astrocyte structure. Finally, we also show that introducing an antigen retrieval step appears useful for visualizing more complete structural details.

AB  - Simple Summary An evolutionary shift in insect diapause strategy has been revealed in a historically univoltine population of Ostrinia furnacalis, a commonly facultative diapause species. Warmer climates are likely to stimulate facultative individuals in the population to shift from univoltinism to bivoltinism due to the compensatory effect of elevated temperature. Climate warming has driven the population to evolve toward dominantly bivoltine or even trivoltine, further leading to more severe damage. To accurately predict phenology and population dynamics in O. furnacalis, it is imperative to account for both the proportions of different diapause individuals with the population and temperature. Herbivorous insects having variable numbers of generations annually depending on climate and day length conditions are increasingly breeding additional generations driven by elevated temperature under the scenario of global warming, which will increase insect abundance and result in more frequent damage events. Theoretically, this relies on two premises, i.e., either an evolutionary shift to facultative diapause for an insect behaving an obligatory diapause or developmental plasticity to alter voltinism productively for an insect with facultative diapause before shortening photoperiods inducing diapause. Inter-population evidence supporting the premise (theory) comes primarily from a model system with voltinism linked to thermal gradients across latitude. We examined the intra-population evidence in the field (47 & DEG;24 & PRIME; N, 123 & DEG;68 & PRIME; E) with Ostrinia furnacalis, one of the most destructive pests, on corn in Asia and Pacific islands. The species was univoltine in high latitudinal areas (& LE;46 & DEG; N). Divergence of the diapause feature (obligatory and facultative) was observed within the field populations from 2016 to 2021. Warmer climates would provoke more facultative diapause individuals to initiate a second generation, which will significantly drive the population to evolve toward facultative diapause (multi-voltinism). Both divergent diapause and temperature must be considered for accurate prediction of phenology and population dynamics in ACB.

AB  - The genetic profile of vertebrate pallia has long driven debate on homology across distantly related clades. Based on an expression profile of the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A2 in mouse and chicken brains, Puelles et al. (The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2016, 524, 665-703) concluded that the avian lateral mesopallium is homologous to the mammalian claustrum, and the medial mesopallium homologous to the insula cortex. They argued that their findings contradict conclusions by Jarvis et al. (The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2013, 521, 3614-3665) and Chen et al. (The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2013, 521, 3666-3701) that the hyperpallium densocellare is instead a mesopallium cell population, and by Suzuki and Hirata (Frontiers in Neuroanatomy, 2014, 8, 783) that the avian mesopallium is homologous to mammalian cortical layers 2/3. Here, we find that NR4A2 is an activity-dependent gene and cannot be used to determine brain organization or species relationships without considering behavioral state. Activity-dependent NR4A2 expression has been previously demonstrated in the rodent brain, with the highest induction occurring within the claustrum, amygdala, deep and superficial cortical layers, and hippocampus. In the zebra finch, we find that NR4A2 is constitutively expressed in the arcopallium, but induced in parts of the mesopallium, and in sparse cells within the hyperpallium, depending on animal stimulus or behavioral state. Basal and induced NR4A2 expression patterns do not discount the previously named avian hyperpallium densocellare as dorsal mesopallium and conflict with proposed homology between the avian mesopallium and mammalian claustrum/insula at the exclusion of other brain regions. Broadly, these findings highlight the importance of controlling for behavioral state and neural activity to genetically define brain cell population relationships within and across species.

AB  - Introduction: The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) include decreased volume, increased signal intensity, and hippocampal gray-white matter boundary blurring (HGWBB). Given that the layered structure is obscure in HS, there have been no reports on the quantita-tive evaluation of HGWBB and its relationship with the clinical outcome. Thus, this study aims to corre-late the extent of HGWBB to its clinical manifestation of HS.Methods: Fifty-four patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent hippocampal resection were enrolled. To evaluate HGWBB quantitatively, we defined an index by calculating the standard deviation of the intrahippocampal signal on short tau inversion recovery. In addition, we created a prognostic scor-ing system using four criteria, including hippocampal signal intensity, size of hippocampal cross-sectional area, presence of temporal lobe lesions, and the HGWBB index.Results: The HGWBB index was significantly lower on the affected side than on the unaffected side (p < 0.001). This trend was more prominent in the poor prognosis group than that in the good prognosis group. The prognostic scoring system revealed that when three or more criteria were positive, the prog-nostic accuracy reached 87.5% sensitivity and 71.7% specificity.Conclusion: The HGWBB index is useful for the diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy with HS and for pre-dicting seizure outcomes when used with another index of hippocampal volume loss and increased signal intensity.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a popular paradigm for modeling animal behavior, analyzing neuronal representations, and studying their emergence during learning. This development has been fueled by advances in understanding the role of RL in both the brain and artificial intelligence. However, while in machine learning a set of tools and standardized benchmarks facilitate the development of new methods and their comparison to existing ones, in neuroscience, the software infrastructure is much more fragmented. Even if sharing theoretical principles, computational studies rarely share software frameworks, thereby impeding the integration or comparison of different results. Machine learning tools are also difficult to port to computational neuroscience since the experimental requirements are usually not well aligned. To address these challenges we introduce CoBeL-RL, a closed-loop simulator of complex behavior and learning based on RL and deep neural networks. It provides a neuroscience-oriented framework for efficiently setting up and running simulations. CoBeL-RL offers a set of virtual environments, e.g., T-maze and Morris water maze, which can be simulated at different levels of abstraction, e.g., a simple gridworld or a 3D environment with complex visual stimuli, and set up using intuitive GUI tools. A range of RL algorithms, e.g., Dyna-Q and deep Q-network algorithms, is provided and can be easily extended. CoBeL-RL provides tools for monitoring and analyzing behavior and unit activity, and allows for fine-grained control of the simulation via interfaces to relevant points in its closed-loop. In summary, CoBeL-RL fills an important gap in the software toolbox of computational neuroscience.

AB  - Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (Bunyavirales: Phlebovirus) is a prominent vector-borne zoonotic disease threat to global agriculture and public health. Risks of introduction into nonendemic regions are tied to changing climate regimes and other dynamic environmental factors that are becoming more prevalent, as well as virus evolutionary factors and human/animal movement. Endemic to the African continent, RVFV has caused large epizootics at the decadal scale since the early 20th century but has spread to the Arabian Peninsula and shows increasing patterns of interepizootic transmission on the annual scale. This virus can be transmitted by mosquitoes as well as through direct contact with infected tissues and can cause sporadic to widespread morbidity and mortality in domestic ungulate livestock as well as humans. High viremias in infected livestock moved for legal and illegal trade as well as in infected mosquitoes or human travelers can spread this virus worldwide. With increasing global commerce, it is likely RVFV will be introduced to new areas with suitable hosts, mosquito vector species, and environments. However, the strong mosquito component of RVFV epidemiology combined with advancements in vaccines, diagnostics, and virus evolutionary factors create opportunities for strategies to leverage models of connectivity among potential source and emerging regions to target surveillance and mitigation activities to reduce the risk of RVFV introduction, or contain the virus should it be introduced, into new regions.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is a life-threatening disease, its pathological progression involves multiple factors, including oxidative stress, apoptosis, and ferroptosis. Our previous study demonstrated that hybridizing N-butylphthalide (NBP) with ligustrazine (TMP) yielded promising anti-ischemic compounds. In this study, we further introduced a triazole structure into NBP-TMP hybrids and synthesized 20 novel compounds. Their neuroprotective activities were evaluated on OGD/R induced SH-SY5Y cells and primary hippocampal neurons, leading to the identification of preferred compounds 8a, 8b and 8d at the concentration of 6.25 mu M, which surpassed the neuroprotective activity of the positive control NBP. Among them, 8a exhibited the highest protective activity, with a protection percentage of 75.6 %. Further mechanistic studies revealed that compounds 8a, 8b and 8d maintained intracellular redox homeostasis to resist oxidative stress and inhibit apoptosis in vitro. Specifically, compound 8a exerted neuroprotective effects by modulating the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway: it bound to KEAP1, enhanced NRF2 dissociation and nuclear translocation, facilitated the generation of downstream antioxidant factors, thereby reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and effectively protecting neuronal mitochondria. Finally, in vivo experiments demonstrated that compound 8a (20 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated cerebral injury in rats with ischemia-reperfusion injury. Furthermore, it reduced cerebral oxidative stress by modulating the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway and inhibited neuronal apoptosis and ferroptosis in the brain, which is consistent with the results in vitro. In conclusion, our results indicated that 8a serves as a promising candidate for stroke treatment and may facilitate the development of future anti-ischemic drugs.

AB  - Silk fibroin (SF), as a special natural polymer, is a good candidate for preparing flexible sensor due to its excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability and amphiphilic properties. However, the high and uncontrollable crystallization of SF makes it challenge to be utilized in excellent biomimetic SF hydrogel sensor. Neat SF hydrogel is brittle and not adhesive. Here, polyacrylamide (PAM) was introduced to the SF hydrogel to address this issue. Due to their strong intermolecular interaction, the network morphology of SF/PAM hydrogel was altered to non-Euclidean pore from Euclidean one. Meanwhile, its beta-sheet crystallization was suppressed to nanoscale readily. These evolutions endow the SF/PAM hydrogel with not only enhanced mechanical properties but also excellent adhesion performance. Compared with that of neat PAM hydrogel, tensile strength, tensile failure strain, compressive strength (under 80% strain) and adhesion performance (on pig skin) of the SF8/PAM hydrogel are increased by 133.1%, 120.9%, 610.8% and 104.8%, respectively. Additionally, the amphiphilicity of SF could make the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) disperse well in hydrogel. CNT0.3/SF8/PAM hydrogel not only inherits but also improves the above properties. It exhibits excellent adhesive sensing performance with maximal gauge factor of 10.13, working strain range of 1000% and stability as long as over 500 cycles. The detection of six human activities was also demonstrated. This work affords a general strategy to achieve high-performance SF-based hydrogel and indicates that the SF/PAM hydrogel possesses great promise for applications in flexible wearable strain sensors.

AB  - An efficient two-step plasma oxidation and reduction process was proposed to recover value-added high-purity iron utilizing recycled pig iron (P-Fe). We researched the influence of different additions of industrial grade iron oxide (Fe2O3) and processing combinations on impurity removal. This involved 15 minutes of argon plasma arc melting (APAM) oxidation or followed by 5 minutes of hydrogen plasma arc melting (HPAM) reduction at 105 (N m-2). Meanwhile, thermodynamic/kinetic elimination models were introduced to describe processes of plasma oxidation, reduction, and evaporation. The obtained 3N high-purity iron demonstrated that, in the first APAM step with 18 pct Fe2O3 addition, over 85 pct of Si, C, and Ti in P-Fe were removed, increasing the purity from 91.7 to 99.906 pct. Thermodynamic and kinetic analyses, alongside studies using electrolytic iron (E-Fe), verified that the removal was attributed to the vaporized gaseous SiO, CO, and the stable TiO2. In the second HPAM step, residual O, N, and S were reduced to less ppm, achieving removal efficiencies of 99.99, 91.7, and 93.6 pct, respectively. The decarburization kinetics revealed high apparent rate constant of 0.00686 s-1 for APAM and 0.00701 s-1 for APAM-HPAM, both with 18 pct Fe2O3 as the oxidant. Furthermore, the kinetic model for Mn evaporation unveiled that gas interface mass transfer, with a rate of 1.399 E-7 m s-1 at 1800 K, was identified as the rate-limiting step.

AB  - KCNQ2 variants in children with neurodevelopmental impairment are difficult to assess due to their heterogeneity and unclear pathogenic mechanisms. We describe a child with neonatal-onset epilepsy, developmental impairment of intermediate severity, and KCNQ2 G256W heterozygosity. Analyzing prior KCNQ2 channel cryoelectron microscopy models revealed G256 as a node of an arch-shaped non-covalent bond network linking S5, the pore turret, and the ion path. Co-expression with G256W dominantly suppressed conduction by wild-type subunits in heterologous cells. Ezogabine partly reversed this suppression. Kcnq2(G256W/+) mice have epilepsy leading to premature deaths. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells from G256W/+ brain slices showed hyperexcitability. G256W/+ pyramidal cell KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 immunolabeling was significantly shifted from axon initial segments to neuronal somata. Despite normal mRNA levels, G256W/+ mouse KCNQ2 protein levels were reduced by about 50%. Our findings indicate that G256W pathogenicity results from multiplicative effects, including reductions in intrinsic conduction, subcellular targeting, and protein stability. These studies provide evidence for an unexpected and novel role for the KCNQ2 pore turret and introduce a valid animal model of KCNQ2 encephalopathy. Our results, spanning structure to behavior, may be broadly applicable because the majority of KCNQ2 encephalopathy patients share variants near the selectivity filter.

AB  - Introduction Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric illness with alarming mortality rates. Nevertheless, despite former and recent research results, the etiology of AN is still poorly understood. Of particular interest is that, despite exaggerated response control and increased perfectionism scores, patients with AN seem not to perform better that those unaffected in tasks that require inhibitory control. One reason might be aberrant processing of errors. The objective of our study was thus to obtain further insight into the pathopsychology of AN. We were particularly interested in neuronal and autonomic responses during error processing and their association with behavior. Methods We analyzed 16 acute patients suffering from restrictive type AN and 21 healthy controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with simultaneous physiological recordings during a Go/Nogo response inhibition task. Data were corrected for noise due to cardiac and respiratory influence. Results Patients and controls had similarly successful response inhibition in Nogo trials. However, in failed Nogo trials, controls had significantly greater skin conductance responses (SCR) than in correct Nogo trials. Patients did not exhibit elevated SCR to errors. Furthermore, we found significantly increased neuronal responses, especially in the amygdala and hippocampus, in controls compared to patients during error trials. We also found significant positive correlations in controls but not in patients between Nogo performance and activation in the salience network core regions after errors. Conclusion Acute restrictive type AN patients seem to lack neuronal and autonomic responses to errors that might impede a flexible behavior adaption.

AB  - Introduction Depressive-like behavior has been shown to be associated with liver damage. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of three different models of depression on the behavior of mice with liver injury.Methods During the 4 weeks of methionine/choline deficiency diet (MCD), adult C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four groups: MCD (no stress protocol, n = 6), chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS, n = 9), acute and repeated forced swim stress [aFSS (n = 9) and rFSS (n = 9)].Results All depression protocols induced increased anhedonia and anxiety-like behavior compared to baseline and had no impact on the severity of liver damage, according to ultrasonography. However, different protocols evoked different overall behavior patterns. After the depressive-like behavior induction protocols, animals subjected to aFSS did not exhibit anxiety-like behavior differences compared to MCD animals, while mice subjected to CUMS showed additional weight loss compared to FSS animals. All tested protocols for inducing depressive-like behavior decreased the short-term memory of mice with liver damage, as assessed by the novel object recognition test (NORT).Discussion Our results show that the use of all protocols seems to generate different levels of anxiety-like behavior, but only the depressive-like behavior induction procedures associate additional anhedonia and memory impairment in mice with liver injury.

AB  - Introduction Clinical studies have established that patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are at an increased risk for developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suggesting that mTBI increases vulnerability to subsequent PTSD onset. However, preclinical animal studies investigating this link remain scarce, and the specific biological mechanism through which mTBI increases vulnerability to PTSD is largely unknown.Methods In this study, we modeled mTBI in rats using a mild, closed-head, weight-drop injury, followed 72 h later by exposure to single prolonged stress (SPS) to simulate PTSD. Then, we investigated the impact of mTBI on subsequent PTSD development by observing the behaviors of rats in a series of validated behavioral tests and further explored the possible role of hippocampal DNA methylation.Results We found that, compared with rats in the PTSD-only group, those in the mTBI + PTSD group exhibited higher anxiety levels, higher depression levels, and impaired spatial learning and memory as determined in the open field test, the forced swimming test, and the Morris water maze test, respectively. Rats in the mTBI + PTSD group also exhibited higher hippocampal DNMT3b protein expression compared with those in the PTSD group.Conclusion In conclusion, our results demonstrated that mTBI increases vulnerability to PTSD in rats, possibly through alterations in hippocampal DNA methylation patterns.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF) isa contagious and lethal hemorrhagic disease with a high case fatality rate. Since 2007, ASF has been spreading into many countries, especially in Europe and Asia. Given that there is no effective vaccine and treatment to deal with ASF, prevention is an important way for a country to avoid the effects of the virus. Australia is currently ASF-free but the disease has been reported in many neighboring countries, such as Indonesia, Timor-Leste, and Papua New Guinea. Therefore, it is necessary for Australia to maintain hypervigilance to prevent the ASF introduction. In this paper, we propose the use of fuzzy concepts to establish a fuzzy risk assessment model to predict the ASF introduction risk in Australia. From the analysis, the international passengers (IP) and international import trade (IIT) are concluded as the two main ASF introduction factors based on transmission features and past research. From the established fuzzy risk assessment model based on the analysis of the 2019 and 2020 data, the risks of ASF introduction into Australia are considered to be low. The model further deduced that the Asian region was the major source of potential risks. Finally, in order to validate the effectiveness of the established fuzzy risk assessment model, the qualitative data from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs of the United Kingdom was used. From the validation results, it has shown that the results were consistent when the same data is adopted, and thus proved that the functionality of the established fuzzy risk assessment model for assessing the risk in Australia.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Inactivation of the Hippo pathway promotes Yap nuclear translocation, enabling execution of a transcriptional program that induces tissue growth. Genetic lesions of Hippo intermediates only identify a minority of cancers with illegitimate YAP activation. Yap has been implicated in resistance to targeted therapies, but the mechanisms by which YAP may impact adaptive resistance to MAPK inhibitors are unknown. Methods: We screened 52 thyroid cancer cell lines for illegitimate nuclear YAP localization by immunofluorescence and fractionation of cell lysates. We engineered a doxycycline (dox)-inducible thyroid-specific mouse model expressing constitutively nuclear YAPS127A, alone or in combination with endogenous expression of either Hras(G12V) or Braf(V600E). We also generated cell lines expressing dox-inducible sh-miR-E-YAP and/or YAP(S127A). We used cell viability, invasion assays, immunofluorescence, Western blotting, qRT-PCRs, flow cytometry and cell sorting, high-throughput bulk RNA sequencing and in vivo tumorigenesis to investigate YAP dependency and response of BRAF-mutant cells to vemurafenib. Results: We found that 27/52 thyroid cancer cell lines had constitutively aberrant YAP nuclear localization when cultured at high density (NU-YAP), which rendered them dependent on YAP for viability, invasiveness and sensitivity to the YAP-TEAD complex inhibitor verteporfin, whereas cells with confluency-driven nuclear exclusion of YAP (CYT-YAP) were not. Treatment of BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells with RAF kinase inhibitors resulted in YAP nuclear transloca-tion and activation of its transcriptional output. Resistance to vemurafenib in BRAF-mutant thyroid cells was driven by YAP-dependent NRG1, HER2 and HER3 activation across all isogenic human and mouse thyroid cell lines tested, which was abrogated by silencing YAP and relieved by pan-HER kinase inhibitors. YAP activation induced analogous changes in BRAF melanoma, but not colorectal cells. Conclusions: YAP activation in thyroid cancer generates a dependency on this transcription factor. YAP governs adaptive resistance to RAF kinase inhibitors and induces a gene expression program in BRAF(V600E)-mutant cells encom-passing effectors in the NRG1 signaling pathway, which play a central role in the insensitivity to MAPK inhibitors in a lineage-dependent manner. HIPPO pathway inactivation serves as a lineage-dependent rheostat controlling the magnitude of the adaptive relief of feedback responses to MAPK inhibitors in BRAF-(V600E) cancers.

AB  - IntroductionIn patients with mild cognitive impairment, pathological changes begin in the amygdala (AMG) and hippocampus (HI), especially in the parahippocampal gyrus and entorhinal cortex (ENT). These areas play an important role in olfactory detection and recognition. It is important to understand how subtle signs of olfactory disability relate to the functions of the above-mentioned regions, as well as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). In this study, we evaluated brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), performed during the presentation of olfactory stimuli (classified as "normal odors" not inducing memory retrieval), and investigated the relationships of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal with olfactory detection and recognition abilities in healthy elderly subjects. MethodsTwenty-four healthy elderly subjects underwent fMRI during olfaction, and raw mean BOLD signals were extracted from regions of interest, including bilateral regions (AMG, HI, parahippocampus, and ENT) and orbitofrontal subregions (frontal inferior OFC, frontal medial OFC, frontal middle OFC, and frontal superior OFC). Multiple regression and path analyses were conducted to understand the roles of these areas in olfactory detection and recognition. ResultsActivation of the left AMG had the greatest impact on olfactory detection and recognition, while the ENT, parahippocampus, and HI acted as a support system for AMG activation. Less activation of the right frontal medial OFC was associated with good olfactory recognition. These findings improve our understanding of the roles of limbic and prefrontal regions in olfactory awareness and identification in elderly individuals. ConclusionFunctional decline of the ENT and parahippocampus crucially impacts olfactory recognition. However, AMG function may compensate for deficits through connections with frontal regions.

AB  - Introduction Pathological abnormalities first appear in the medial temporal regions including entorhinal cortex and parahippocampus in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies showed that olfactory decline in elderly subjects was associated with volume reductions in the left hippocampus and left parahippocampus without cognitive impairment. The aim of this study is to investigate the link between olfaction and volume reductions in the medial temporal regions including the parahippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampal subfields.
   Method 27 elderly subjects and 27 young controls were measured olfaction acuity, cognitive function, and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Image processing and gray matter volumetric segmentation were performed with FreeSurfer. Volume data were analyzed with SPSS Statistics software.
   Results Interesting results of this study were that volume reduction in the entorhinal cortex was not directly linked with declining olfactory ability. Volume reduction in the left entorhinal cortex was correlated with volume reduction in the left parahippocampus and dentate gyrus. However, left parahippocampus volume reduction had the greatest impact on olfactory decline, and the entorhinal cortex and dentate gyrus might additionally contribute to olfactory decline.
   Conclusion Our results indicate that olfactory decline may be directly reflected in the medial temporal regions as reduced parahippocampus volumes, rather than as morphological changes in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. The parahippocampus may play an important role in the association between memory retrieval and olfactory identification.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel hybrid optimization technique aimed at improving the prediction accuracy of solar photovoltaic (PV) outputs using an Improved Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm (IHO). The IHO enhances the traditional Hippopotamus Optimization (HO) algorithm by addressing its limitations in search efficiency, convergence speed, and global exploration. The IHO algorithm used Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) for population initialization, significantly enhancing the diversity and global search potential of the optimization process. The integration of the Jaya algorithm further refines solution quality and accelerates convergence. Additionally, a combination of unordered dimensional sampling, random crossover, and sequential mutation is employed to enhance the optimization process. The effectiveness of the proposed IHO is demonstrated through the optimization of weights and neuron thresholds in the extreme learning machine (ELM), a model known for its rapid learning capabilities but often affected by the randomness of initial parameters. The IHO-optimized ELM (IHO-ELM) is tested against benchmark algorithms, including BP, the traditional ELM, the HO-ELM, LCN, and LSTM, showing significant improvements in prediction accuracy and stability. Moreover, the IHO-ELM model is validated in a different region to assess its generalization ability for solar PV output prediction. The results confirm that the proposed hybrid approach not only improves prediction accuracy but also demonstrates robust generalization capabilities, making it a promising tool for predictive modeling in solar energy systems.

AB  - Measuring distances in biology at the molecular level is of great importance for understanding the structure and function of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules and their complexes. Pulsed Dipolar Spectroscopy (PDS) offers advantages with respect to othermethods as it is uniquely sensitive and specific to electronic spin centers and allows measurements in near-native conditions, comprising the in-cell environment. PDSmethods measure the electron spin-spin dipolar interaction, therefore they require the presence of at least two paramagnetic centers, which are often stable radicals. Recent developments have introduced transient triplet states, photo-activated by a laser pulse, as spin labels and probes, thereby establishing a new family of techniques-Light-induced PDS (LiPDS). In this chapter, an overview of these methods is provided, looking at the chromophores that can be used for LiPDS and some of the technical aspects of the experiments. A guide to the choice of technique that can yield the best results, depending on the type of system studied and the information required, is provided. Examples of previous LiPDS studies of model systems and proteins are given. Characterization data for the chromophores used in these studies is tabulated to help selection of appropriate triplet state probes in future studies.

AB  - Camellia vietnamensis Huang, which belongs to Camellia oleifera, is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant widely planted on Hainan Island. Tea saponin is an important functional component of C. vietnamensis, and squalene is the precursor substance that controls its formation. Squalene synthase (SQS: EC 2.5.1.21) synthesizes squalene from 2 molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). In this study, 1683 bp of the C. vietnamensis SQS gene, designated as CvSQS, was cloned and encoded 414 amino acids. Bioinformatics and phylogenetic tree analysis revealed the high homology of CvSQS with squalene synthases from other plants. For soluble proteins, the carboxy-terminal deleted CvSQS was obtained for expression in Escherichia coli Transetta (DE3), and the recombinant protein with a weight of 42.5 kDa was detected using SDS-PAGE and Western blot. After an enzymatic reaction, the presence of squalene in the product was analyzed using GC-MS detection, which indicated that CvSQS had catalytic activity. The tissue specificity of CvSQS and its presence in seeds at various ripening stages was detected by q-RT PCR. CvSQS had the highest transcriptional level in leaves, followed by seeds, roots, and flowers; the amount of CvSQS in the seeds was highest in September. The identification and functional characterization of CvSQS is essential for further studies on the regulation mechanism of tea saponin in C. vietnamensis.

AB  - The oncogenes yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are potent liver oncogenes. Because gene mutations cannot fully explain their nuclear enrichment, we aim to understand which mechanisms cause YAP/TAZ activation in liver cancer cells. The combination of proteomics and functional screening identified numerous apical cell polarity complex proteins interacting with YAP and TAZ. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments confirmed that membrane protein palmitoylated 5 (MPP5; synonym: PALS1) physically interacts with YAP and TAZ. After removing different MPP5 protein domains, Co-IP analyses revealed that the PDZ domain plays a crucial role in YAP binding. The interaction between YAP and MPP5 in the cytoplasm of cancer cells was demonstrated by proximity ligation assays (PLAs). In human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, a reduction in apical MPP5 expression was observed, correlating with the nuclear accumulation of YAP and TAZ. Expression data analysis illustrated that MPP5 is inversely associated with YAP/TAZ target gene signatures in human HCCs. Low MPP5 levels define an HCC patient group with a poor clinical outcome. In summary, MPP5 facilitates the nuclear exclusion of YAP and TAZ in liver cancer. This qualifies MPP5 as a potential tumor-suppressor gene and explains how changes in cell polarity can foster tumorigenesis.

AB  - Background and objectiveNo autochthonous human cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) have been reported to date in the European Union (EU). In this study, we assess the likelihood of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) introduction and transmission within the EU and propose outbreak response measures.Risk assessmentGiven the global geographical distribution of JEV, the probability of virus introduction into the EU is currently very low, with viremic bird migration being the most plausible pathway of introduction. However, this likelihood would significantly increase if the virus were to become established in the Middle East, Caucasus, Central Asia or Africa. Considering the environmental conditions that are expected to be conducive for virus circulation, there is a high likelihood of virus transmission within the EU after its introduction in environmentally suitable areas. The spread of the virus within the EU would likely occur through the movement of wild birds, pigs and mosquitoes.MitigationTo mitigate or potentially contain the emergence of JE in the EU, early detection of both human and animal cases will be crucial.

AB  - Targeted knock-in of specific DNA sequences using CRISPR/Cas9 is an advanced technology that enables programmed genome alterations including insertions, deletions, and base substitutions exactly as designed. Despite its utility in life sciences and promise for medical and industrial applications, it remains critical to establish a methodology for highly precise and efficient targeted knock-in to facilitate the practical use of this technology. Tandem paired nicking (TPN) is a genome editing methodology leveraging nicking variants of CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases (Cas9 nickases) to create site-specific nicks within the homologous region of the genome and donor DNA. Such nicking configuration promotes precise and efficient targeted knock-in while repressing the formation of unintended insertions and deletions and p53-mediated DNA damage response. In this study, we conducted a detailed characterization of TPN-based targeted knock-in by performing genome editing assays with various nicking configurations modified from TPN. Our results demonstrated that genomic nicks remarkably contribute to TPN-based targeted knock-in, whereas donor nicks play a less critical role. The introduction of additional nicks beyond the standard two-nick configuration did not further improve the efficiency of TPN-based targeted knock-in. Comparison with other Cas9 nickase-based methodologies for targeted knock-in demonstrated largely equivalent knock-in efficiencies achieved by these methodologies. High-throughput long-read sequencing confirmed a lower incidence of undesired insertions and deletions of various lengths by TPN, in comparison with a conventional Cas9 nuclease-based approach. These findings underscore TPN as a methodology for precise and efficient targeted knock-in, and highlight the broad potential of Cas9 nickase-based targeted knock-in for clinical and industrial applications.

AB  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is the most important support for patients with severe cardiopulmonary failure. As the key component, the oxygenation membrane has suffered the risk of blood coagulation and plasma leakage in the long term. Herein, we prepare a sulfonate polyamide film on poly(ether sulfone) (PES) support via interfacial polymerization modulated by a sulfonate amine monomer. The pore diameter of the prepared polyamide film is similar to 3.67 & Aring; (exactly a little smaller than the water molecule, the base of plasma). By such size repulsion effect, the polyamide film demonstrates remarkable plasma leakage resistance (confirmed by human plasma circulation). Moreover, the introduction of the sulfonate amine monomer effectively enhances the anticoagulation performance (activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) prolongation >10 s). In addition, the PES support used for interfacial polymerization is modified and realizes improved porosity, hydrophilicity, and positive charge potential, resulting in lower mass transfer resistance and improved interfacial strength between the support and polyamide film. ECMO-simulated circulation tests prove the facilitation effect on gas exchange derived from the support modification and interfacial polymerization modulation. This work provides a composite membrane simultaneously with significant plasma leakage resistance and anticoagulation properties for efficient blood oxygenation.

AB  - Simple Summary Over the past three decades, the litter size of sows has been increased to improve productivity. This has not only led to more piglets per sow, but also an increased proportion of low birth weight piglets, and consequently, higher pre-weaning mortality. In an attempt to improve the resilience of small piglets, an oral supplementation (drenching) with a bioactive compound can be applied. In this study, low birth weight piglets were drenched with bovine colostrum, short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides or quercetin (each dissolved in a plain milk replacer) during the first seven days after birth. The animals' body weight, mortality, skin lesions, and different blood parameters were evaluated between birth and 2 weeks post-weaning. None of the supplemented compounds had a positive effect on any of the parameters, and thus, on the resilience of low birth weight piglets. Moreover, a negative effect on survival was observed in piglets that were drenched with short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides. These results showed that the evaluated bioactive compounds, in their given dosages, were unable to improve the low birth weight piglets' survival and emphasized the complex, multifactorial origin of pre-weaning mortality. The introduction of hyperprolific sows has resulted in more low birth weight (LBW) piglets, accompanied by higher mortality. A possible strategy to enhance the resilience and survival of LBW piglets is oral supplementation (drenching) of bioactive substances. This study evaluated the supplementation of bovine colostrum, short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scFOS) or quercetin that were dissolved separately in a milk replacer. The study was divided into two sub-experiments. First, the milk replacer was compared with a sham drenched group. Secondly, each dissolved compound was compared with the milk replacer. The LBW piglets, defined as weighing between (mean litter birth weight -1*SD) and (mean litter birth weight -2.5*SD), were randomly allocated to the different treatments and drenched once a day for seven days. On day 1, 3, 9, 24 and 38, piglets were weighed and scored for skin lesions. Blood samples were collected on day 9 and 38 and analyzed to determine glucose, non-esterified fatty acids, urea, immunoglobulin G, insulin-like growth factor 1, and a standard blood panel test. There was no difference between sham drenched piglets and piglets that were drenched with milk replacer regarding any of the parameters. No effect was observed between the milk replacer group and any of the bioactive compounds either, except a higher mortality within the scFOS group. In conclusion, this study showed that drenching the evaluated bioactive compounds, in the used dosages, did not improve LBW piglets' resilience or survival and more research is required to determine the effect of scFOS on small piglets.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION What is the effect of the chemical in vitro activation (cIVA) protocol compared with fragmentation only (Frag, also known as mechanical IVA) on gene expression, follicle activation and growth in human ovarian tissue in vitro? SUMMARY ANSWER Although histological assessment shows that cIVA significantly increases follicle survival and growth compared to Frag, both protocols stimulate extensive and nearly identical transcriptomic changes in cultured tissue compared to freshly collected ovarian tissue, including marked changes in energy metabolism and inflammatory responses. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Treatments based on cIVA of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in ovarian tissue followed by auto-transplantation have been administered to patients with refractory premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and resulted in live births. However, comparable effects with mere tissue fragmentation have been shown, questioning the added value of chemical stimulation that could potentially activate oncogenic responses. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Fifty-nine ovarian cortical biopsies were obtained from consenting women undergoing elective caesarean section (C-section). The samples were fragmented for culture studies. Half of the fragments were exposed to bpV (HOpic)+740Y-P (Frag+cIVA group) during the first 24 h of culture, while the other half were cultured with medium only (Frag group). Subsequently, both groups were cultured with medium only for an additional 6 days. Tissue and media samples were collected for histological, transcriptomic, steroid hormone, and cytokine/chemokine analyses at various time points. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Effects on follicles were evaluated by counting and scoring serial sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin before and after the 7-day culture. Follicle function was assessed by quantification of steroids by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry at different time points. Cytokines and chemokines were measured by multiplex assay. Transcriptomic effects were measured by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of the tissue after the initial 24-h culture. Selected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were validated by quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence in cultured ovarian tissue as well as in KGN cell (human ovarian granulosa-like tumor cell line) culture experiments. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Compared to the Frag group, the Frag+cIVA group exhibited a significantly higher follicle survival rate, increased numbers of secondary follicles, and larger follicle sizes. Additionally, the tissue in the Frag+cIVA group produced less dehydroepiandrosterone compared to Frag. Cytokine measurement showed a strong inflammatory response at the start of the culture in both groups. The RNA-seq data revealed modest differences between the Frag+cIVA and Frag groups, with only 164 DEGs identified using a relaxed cut-off of false discovery rate (FDR) <0.1. Apart from the expected PI3K-protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, cIVA also regulated pathways related to hypoxia, cytokines, and inflammation. In comparison to freshly collected ovarian tissue, gene expression in general was markedly affected in both the Frag+cIVA and Frag groups, with a total of 3119 and 2900 DEGs identified (FDR < 0.001), respectively. The top enriched gene sets in both groups included several pathways known to modulate follicle growth such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1 signaling.
   Significant changes compared to fresh tissue were also observed in the expression of genes encoding for steroidogenesis enzymes and classical granulosa cell markers in both groups. Intriguingly, we discovered a profound upregulation of genes related to glycolysis and its upstream regulator in both Frag and Frag+cIVA groups, and these changes were further boosted by the cIVA treatment. Cell culture experiments confirmed glycolysis-related genes as direct targets of the cIVA drugs. In conclusion, cIVA enhances follicle growth, as expected, but the mechanisms may be more complex than PI3K-Akt-mTOR alone, and the impact on function and quality of the follicles after the culture period remains an open question. LARGE SCALE DATA Data were deposited in the GEO data base, accession number GSE234765. The code for sequencing analysis can be found in https://github.com/tialiv/IVA_project. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Similar to the published IVA protocols, the first steps in our study were performed in an in vitro culture model where the ovarian tissue was isolated from the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Further in vivo experiments will be needed, for example in xeno-transplantation models, to explore the long-term impacts of the discovered effects. The tissue collected from patients undergoing C-section may not be comparable to tissue of patients with POI. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The general impact of fragmentation and short (24 h) in vitro culture on gene expression in ovarian tissue far exceeded the effects of cIVA. Yet, follicle growth was stimulated by cIVA, which may suggest effects on specific cell populations that may be diluted in bulk RNA-seq. Nevertheless, we confirmed the impact of cIVA on glycolysis using a cell culture model, suggesting impacts on cellular signaling beyond the PI3K pathway. The profound changes in inflammation and glycolysis following fragmentation and culture could contribute to follicle activation and loss in ovarian tissue culture, as well as in clinical applications, such as fertility preservation by ovarian tissue auto-transplantation.

AB  - Simple Summary This paper introduces a new method of finding the best locations to place video cameras inside large cattle barns to monitor the behavior and health of the animals. Current approaches to livestock video monitoring rely on mounting cameras in the most convenient places for installation, but those locations might either be impractical for actual barns and/or might not capture the best views. This work showed that there is short list of the best placement options for the cameras to choose from which will provide the best camera views. Computer vision has been extensively used for livestock welfare monitoring in recent years, and data collection with a sensor or camera is the first part of the complete workflow. While current practice in computer vision-based animal welfare monitoring often analyzes data collected from a sensor or camera mounted on the roof or ceiling of a laboratory, such camera placement is not always viable in a commercial confined cattle feeding environment. This study therefore sought to determine the optimal camera placement locations in a confined steer feeding operation. Measurements of cattle pens were used to create a 3D farm model using Blender 3D computer graphic software. In the first part of this study, a method was developed to calculate the camera coverage in a 3D farm environment, and in the next stage, a genetic algorithm-based model was designed for finding optimal placements of a multi-camera and multi-pen setup. The algorithm's objective was to maximize the multi-camera coverage while minimizing budget. Two different optimization methods involving multiple cameras and pen combinations were used. The results demonstrated the applicability of the genetic algorithm in achieving the maximum coverage and thereby enhancing the quality of the livestock visual-sensing data. The algorithm also provided the top 25 solutions for each camera and pen combination with a maximum coverage difference of less than 3.5% between them, offering numerous options for the farm manager.

AB  - Objective Lipofection-mediated introduction of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in porcine zygotes provides a simple method for gene editing, without requiring micromanipulation. However, the gene editing efficiency is inadequate. The aim of this study was to improve the lipofection-mediated gene editing efficiency by optimizing the timing and duration of lipofection. Results Zona pellucida (ZP)-free zygotes collected at 5, 10, and 15 h from the start of in vitro fertilization (IVF) were incubated with lipofection reagent, guide RNA (gRNA) targeting GGTA1, and Cas9 for 5 h. Lipofection of zygotes collected at 10 and 15 h from the start of IVF yielded mutant blastocysts. Next, ZP-free zygotes collected at 10 h from the start of IVF were incubated with lipofection reagent, gRNA, and Cas9 for 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 h. The blastocyst formation rate of zygotes treated for 20 h was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those of the other groups, and no mutant blastocysts were obtained. Moreover, the mutation rates of the resulting blastocysts decreased as the incubation time increased. In conclusion, a lipofection-mediated gene editing system using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in ZP-zygotes is feasible; however, further improvements in the gene editing efficiency are required.

AB  - Fruit maturity is the main factor affecting the quality and yield of Camellia oil. At present, accurate and efficient detection of the maturity level of Camellia oleifera fruits in orchards and enabling selective picking for harvesting robots is a crucial issue. Aiming at the challenge of low detection efficiency of Camellia oleifera fruit maturity and complex object detection models that are difficult to deploy to Camellia oleifera selective harvesting robots, a modified lightweight You Only Look Once model (YOLO-LM) based on YOLOv7-tiny is proposed. Specifically, three Criss-Cross Attention (CCA) modules are introduced to the backbone network to reduce the influence of leaves and branches occlusion as well as mutual occlusion between fruits. Then, the Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) module is applied as the head to solve the limitation of inconsistency across different feature scales on the feature pyramid. Furthermore, the GSConv is introduced to replace the standard convolution of the Neck network to enable the model to simultaneously preserve model accuracy and reduce model complexity. Experiment results demonstrate that the precision, recall, mAP@0.5, parameters, FLOPs, and model size of YOLO-LM reached 93.96 %, 93.32 %, 93.18 %, 10.17 million, 19.46 G, and 19.82 MB, which outperformed YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN (VGG16), Faster R-CNN (ResNet50), YOLOv4, and YOLOv5m. Compared to YOLOv3-tiny, YOLOv4-tiny, YOLOv5s, YOLOv7-tiny, and YOLOv8s, the mAP@0.5 of YOLO-LM increased by 6.24 %, 6.11 %, 2.52 %, 2.45 %, and 0.57 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the parameters and model size of YOLO-LM are slightly higher than that of YOLOv3-tiny, YOLOv4-tiny, YOLOv5s and YOLOv7-tiny, and significantly lower than that of YOLOv8s. In addition, the detection heatmaps of YOLOv7-tiny and YOLO-LM demonstrate these optimization operations contribute to the enhanced performance of maturity detection for Camellia oleifera fruits within natural orchard environments. Overall, the YOLO-LM model can be used for the maturity detection of Camellia oleifera fruits in orchards, which is expected to provide theoretical reference for orchard yield estimation, growth monitoring, planting management optimization and the development of Camellia oleifera selective harvesting robots.

AB  - The hippocampus forms unique neural representations for distinct experiences, supporting the formation of different memories.1-6 Hippocampal representations gradually change over time as animals repeatedly visit the same familiar environment ("representational drift").7-12 Such drift has also been observed in other brain areas, such as the parietal,13,14 visual,15-17 auditory,18,19 and olfactory20 cortices. While the underlying mechanisms of representational drift remain unclear, a leading hypothesis suggests that it results from ongoing learning processes.20-22 According to this hypothesis, because the brain uses the same neural substrates to support multiple distinct representations, learning of novel stimuli or environments leads to changes in the neuronal representation of a familiar one. If this is true, we would expect drift in a given environment to increase following new experiences in other, unrelated environments (i.e., off-context experiences). To test this hypothesis, we longitudinally recorded large populations of hippocampal neurons in mice while they repeatedly visited a familiar linear track over weeks. We introduced off-context experiences by placing mice in a novel environment for 1 h after each visit to the familiar track. Contrary to our expectations, these novel episodes decreased place cells' representational drift. Our findings are consistent with a model in which representations of distinct memories occupy different areas within the neuronal activity space, and the drift of each of them within that space is constrained by the area occupied by the others.

AB  - Introduction: Spermatozoa cryopreservation is an important technique to preserve fertility for males. This study aimed at exploring the stability of epigenetics information in human spermatozoa, manipulated by two different technologies, freezing and vitrification. Methods: Spermatozoa samples were distributed into three groups: 1. Fresh spermatozoa (control group), 2. Frozen spermatozoa, 3. Vitrified spermatozoa. Epigenetic differences of fresh and cryopreserved spermatozoa were evaluated using high-throughput RNA sequencing. Results: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in frozen (1103 genes) and vitrified (333 genes) spermatozoa were evaluated. The bioinformatical analysis identified 8 and 15 significant pathways in groups of frozen and vitrified spermatozoa, respectively. The majority of these pathways are most relevant to immune and infectious diseases. The DEGs of the fertilization process are not detected during vitrification. The freezing process induces more down-regulation of genes and is relevant to apoptosis changes and immune response. Conclusion: Cryopreservation of human spermatozoa is an epigenetically safe method for male fertility preservation. Cryoprotectant-free vitrification can induce more minor biological changes in human spermatozoa, in comparison with conventional freezing.

AB  - Introduction: Intermittent fasting enhances neural bioenergetics, is neuroprotective, and elicits antioxidant effects in various animal models. There are conflicting findings on seizure protection, where intermittent fasting regimens often cause severe weight loss resembling starvation which is unsustainable long-term. Therefore, we tested whether a less intensive intermittent fasting regimen such as time-restricted feeding (TRF) may confer seizure protection. Methods: Male CD1 mice were assigned to either ad libitum-fed control, continuous 8 h TRF, or 8 h TRF with weekend ad libitum food access (2:5 TRF) for one month. Body weight, food intake, and blood glucose levels were measured. Seizure thresholds were determined at various time points using 6-Hz and maximal electroshock seizure threshold (MEST) tests. Protein levels and mRNA expression of genes, enzyme activity related to glucose metabolism, as well as mitochondrial dynamics were assessed in the cortex and hippocampus. Markers of antioxidant defence were evaluated in the plasma, cortex, and liver. Results: Body weight gain was similar in the ad libitum-fed and TRF mouse groups. In both TRF regimens, blood glucose levels did not change between the fed and fasted state and were higher during fasting than in the ad libitum-fed groups. Mice in the TRF group had increased seizure thresholds in the 6-Hz test on day 15 and on day 19 in a second cohort of 2:5 TRF mice, but similar seizure thresholds at other time points compared to ad libitumfed mice. Continuous TRF did not alter MEST seizure thresholds on day 28. Mice in the TRF group showed increased maximal activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in the cortex, which was accompanied by increased protein levels of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 in the cortex and hippocampus. There were no other major changes in protein or mRNA levels associated with energy metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics in the brain, nor markers of antioxidant defence in the brain, liver, or plasma. Conclusions: Both continuous and 2:5 TRF regimens transiently increased seizure thresholds in the 6-Hz model at around 2 weeks, which coincided with stability of blood glucose levels during the fed and fasted periods. Our findings suggest that the lack of prolonged anticonvulsant effects in the acute electrical seizure models employed may be attributed to only modest metabolic and antioxidant adaptations found in the brain and liver. Our findings underscore the potential therapeutic value of TRF in managing seizure-related conditions.

AB  - Utilizing large-scale epigenomics data, deep learning tools can predict the regulatory activity of genomic sequences, annotate non-coding genetic variants, and uncover mechanisms behind complex traits. However, these tools primarily rely on human or mouse data for training, limiting their performance when applied to other species. Furthermore, the limited exploration of many species, particularly in the case of livestock, has led to a scarcity of comprehensive and high-quality epigenetic data, posing challenges in developing reliable deep learning models for decoding their non-coding genomes. The cross-species prediction of the regulatory genome can be achieved by leveraging publicly available data from extensively studied organisms and making use of the conserved DNA binding preferences of transcription factors within the same tissue. In this study, we introduced DeepSATA, a novel deep learning-based sequence analyzer that incorporates the transcription factor binding affinity for the cross-species prediction of chromatin accessibility. By applying DeepSATA to analyze the genomes of pigs, chickens, cattle, humans, and mice, we demonstrated its ability to improve the prediction accuracy of chromatin accessibility and achieve reliable cross-species predictions in animals. Additionally, we showcased its effectiveness in analyzing pig genetic variants associated with economic traits and in increasing the accuracy of genomic predictions. Overall, our study presents a valuable tool to explore the epigenomic landscape of various species and pinpoint regulatory deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) variants associated with complex traits.

AB  - In this study, a novel camellia oil composite oleogel (SX@G-CO) was prepared by a combination of direct dispersion and emulsion-templated methods using polysaccharides (sodium alginate and xanthan gum, ratio in 4:6) as oleogelators and glycerol monolaurate (GML, 7 wt%) as gel-enhancer. The comparative experiments revealed that the polysaccharides could effectively enhance the densification of the three-dimensional network structure of the oleogel through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, and significantly improve its thermal stability, rheological properties (adhesive strength 49,243.6 mPa center dot s, center dot s, viscosity recovery rate 94.6 %) and oil binding capacity (80.6 %). The introduction of GML further enriched the crystal diversity of the oleogel and imparted excellent antimicrobial ability (nearly 100 % inhibition effect on E.coli). ). Furthermore, the in vitro experiments demonstrated that the synergistic effect of polysaccharides and GML significantly enhanced the antiinflammatory, antioxidant, cell migration and proliferation abilities of SX@G-CO oleogel compared with GMLCO and SX-CO oleogels. In addition, SX@G-CO oleogel has also been demonstrated to effectively promote full-thickness burn healing in mice by reducing bacterial infection and inflammatory response, regulating free radical levels, and promoting neovascularization in vivo, with effects comparable to marketed ointment. SX@GCO oleogel as a bioactive molecule-polysaccharides composite has potential clinical application in burn wound repair.

AB  - Zebrafish have revolutionised physiological screening in vertebrates, however, their strong sociality present challenges for interpreting behavioural assays conducted on individual subjects. To retain the advantages of the zebrafish model while addressing its limitations, we propose the use of a solitary species-the paradise fish-as a complementary model system. We compared paradise fish and zebrafish of late larval stage in social and non-social exploratory tasks, anxiety tests and in a working memory assay to assess their performance in these individual-based challenges. We found that in contrast to zebrafish, paradise fish did not show social approach in sociability tests, their exploratory behaviour was unaffected by the presence of a conspecific, and social isolation did not impair their performance during anxiety tests. Intra- and intertest variability measures of different anxiety tests revealed that, compared to zebrafish, paradise fish express more consistent, repeatable patterns of exploratory and risk-avoidance behaviour across time and contexts. We also showed that paradise fish exploration of the Y-maze is dominated by arm alternations, suggesting advanced working memory. Considering the results of this systematic comparison and the natural history of the two species we recommend prioritizing zebrafish in social tasks, while favouring paradise fish in individual-based behavioural assays.

AB  - Knowledge of the developmental ontogeny of the digestive system and nutritional requirements of marine fish larvae is a primary requisite for their successful rearing under an optimal feeding regime. In this context, we assessed the activity profile of key digestive enzymes viz., trypsin, chymotrypsin, leucine aminopeptidase, lipase, amylase, and alkaline phosphatase during the early ontogeny of milkfish, Chanos chanos (0 day, 3 days, 6 days, 9 days, 12 days, 15 days, 18 days, 21 days, 25 days, and 30 days post-hatch). Larvae for this study were obtained from the successful breeding of milkfish at ICAR-Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture, India. Growth curves (length and weight) of the larvae indicated a positive morphological development under a standardized feeding regime that comprised Chlorella salina, Brachionus plicatilis, Artemia salina nauplii, and commercial weaning feed for different larval stages. With respect to protein digestion, the specific activity of pancreatic enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin and intestinal brush border leucine aminopeptidase showed two peaks at 3 dph and 15 dph, following the introduction of rotifer and Artemia nauplii. Similar bimodal peaks were observed for alkaline phosphatase and amylase activities, with the first peak at 3 dph and the second peak at 18 dph and 21 dph, respectively. Whereas in the case of lipase, high activity levels were observed at 0 dph, 3 dph, and 18 dph, with subsequent decreases and fluctuations. Overall, as most of the enzymes were found to have peak activities at 15 to 21 dph, this period can be potentially considered as the developmental window for weaning larvae from live to formulated feeds in milkfish hatcheries.

AB  - We introduce DHARANI, the first online platform with three-dimensional (3D) histological reconstructions of the developing human brain from 14 to 24 gestational weeks (GW) across the five fetal brains. DHARANI features 5132 Nissl, hematoxylin and eosin stained, 20 mu m coronal and sagittal sections, postmortem MRI, and a neuroanatomical atlas with 466 annotated sections covering similar to 500 brain structures. It is accessible online at . The 3D reconstruction enables a volumetric view of the fetal brain, allowing visualization in all three planes akin to MRI, previously unachievable with histological datasets from the fetal brain. This allowed qualitative assessment of the growth of brain regions and layers throughout the second trimester. "DHARANI" documents the initiation of sulci, with the lateral fissure, calcarine, parieto-occipital, and cingulate sulci, at 14 GW. The central and postcentral sulci appear by 24 GW; however, cytoarchitectonic boundaries become visible before sulcal patterns. Cortical plate (CP) lamination begins at 24 GW in the parietal and occipital cortices. The frontal cortex lacks lamination at 24 GW, although putative Betz cells are already visible and show early patterning in the intermediate zone. The cell-sparse layer between the CP and subplate, containing late migratory neurons, begins in the orbital cortex at 14 GW and reaches the frontal cortex by 17 GW. The appearance of the honeycomb pattern in the occipital and parietal cortex occurs after 14 GW. Additionally, we describe the development of the thalamic pregeniculate with the rotation of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Cerebellar nuclei and an early Purkinje cell layer appear by 21 GW in the already foliated cerebellar cortex.

AB  - Introduction: After birth, the lungs must resorb the fluid they contain. This process involves multiple actors such as surfactant, aquaporins and ENaC channels. Preterm newborns often exhibit respiratory distress syndrome due to surfactant deficiency, and transitory tachypnea caused by a delay in lung liquid resorption. Our hypothesis is that surfactant, ENaC and aquaporins are involved in respiratory transition to extrauterine life and altered by preterm birth. We compared these candidates in preterm and term fetal sheeps. Materials and methods: We performed cesarean sections in 8 time-dated pregnant ewes (4 at 100 days and 4 at 140 days of gestation, corresponding to 24 and 36 weeks of gestation in humans), and obtained 13 fetal sheeps in each group. We studied surfactant synthesis (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C), lung liquid resorption (ENaC, aquaporins) and corticosteroid regulation (glucocorticoid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor and 11-betaHSD2) at mRNA and protein levels.Results: The mRNA expression level of SFTPA, SFTPB and SFTPC was higher in the term group. These results were confirmed at the protein level for SP-B on Western Blot analysis and for SP-A, SP-B and SP-C on immunohistochemical analysis. Regarding aquaporins, ENaC and receptors, mRNA expression levels for AQP1, AQP3, AQP5, ENaC alpha, ENaCfi, ENaC gamma and 11fiHSD2 mRNA were also higher in the term group.Discussion: Expression of surfactant proteins, aquaporins and ENaC increases between 100 and 140 days of gestation in an ovine model. Further exploring these pathways and their hormonal regulation could highlight some new explanations in the pathophysiology of neonatal respiratory diseases.

AB  - Introduction: A previous study from our Laboratory showed no alteration in inflammatory parameters seven days after ouabain (OUA) administration, a Na(+)K(+)ATPase inhibitor, which was previously considered only a mania model. However, the administration of OUA in rats was recently validated as a model of bipolar disorder (BD) symptoms, demonstrating that 14 days after single intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration, OUA also induces depressive-like behavior. Therefore, it is important to investigate the long-term effect of OUA on inflammatory parameters since this mechanism seems to play a key role in BD physiopathology. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats received a single ICV administration of OUA or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). From the fourth day after the ICV infusion, the rats received saline or Lithium (Li) for 14 days. The open-field test was performed on the 7th day after OUA. On the 14th day, locomotion was re-evaluated, and the forced swimming test (FST) was used to evaluate depressive-like behavior. Inflammatory parameters were assessed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Results: OUA increased the locomotion of rats after seven days, considered a mania-like behavior. In the FST, OUA increased the time of immobility on the 14th day, considered a depressive-like behavior. Li reversed the mania-like behavior and partially reversed the depressive-like behavior. Furthermore, OUA increased the levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and CINC-1 in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Li treatment re-verses all these inflammatory alterations. Conclusion: This study suggests that the long-term Na+K+ATPase inhibition effects induce depressive-like behavior, which was accompanied by inflammation in the BD symptoms model.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The color of fresh pork is a very important feature, both for the meat industry and especially for direct consumers. Consumers often relate color to the freshness and quality of pork. Quality evaluation of fresh pork intended for sale or processing seems to be a priority task for meat plants due to the expectations of modern consumers. Meat can be characterized as a mixture of different chemical components, each of which contributes to its quality either independently or in combination with other ingredients. The complexity of muscle structure and the tasks performed by individual muscles may contribute to uneven color distribution. The presented results are an important contribution to the rapid and precise instrumental evaluation of pH and color. The information may be particularly important for meat plants, which, by introducing such an evaluation, allow consumers to additionally verify the product.
   The aim of this study was to determine the effect of 30 min bloom time and the type of muscle on pH and color parameters together with the possibility of estimating these measurements. The research material consisted of 270 samples from 6 muscle types: LD-Longissimus dorsi, LL-Longissimus lumborum, IL-Iliacus, SEM-Semimembranosus, CT-Cutaneous trunci, LTD-Latissimus dorsi. Measurements included pH and color of fresh pork at 0 min, and after 30 min bloom time. Bloom time influenced all analyzed parameters, although to a varying effect, depending on the muscle type. The lowest pH values were noted for dorsal-located muscles (LD, LL), then in the ham area (IL, SEM), and the highest values of the location on the side surface of the carcass (CT, LTD). The large increase in the proportion of L* and a* was observed for CT muscle (20-30%, the highest of all observed) and LTD (20-25%); for LD and LL the largest growth changes were observed for parameters b* (15-20%) and H* (20-30%). The lowest number of strong correlations was noted for LD and CT muscles, and the largest for SEM. A very good fit (R-2 > 0.90) of regression equations was achieved in 7 cases. The presented results are an important contribution to the rapid and precise instrumental evaluation of pH and color.

AB  - MicroRNAs have been recognized as important regulators of the aging process. Trehalose, a natural disaccharide, displays protective effects against neuronal impairment through several mechanisms. However, little is known about the interactive effects of aging and trehalose on behavioral function and underlying miRNA expression patterns in the hippocampus of young and old rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups. Two groups of aged (24 months) and young (4 months) rats were administered 2% trehalose solution for 30 days. Two other groups of aged and young rats received regular tap water. At the end of treatment, rats were assessed for cognitive behavior using the Morris water maze test. The expression level of miR-181c and mir-34c was also measured by qRT-PCR. We found that trehalose treatment reduced learning and memory impairment in old rats compared to control old animals (p < 0.05). In contrast, cognitive performance was not significantly improved in trehalose-treated young rats in comparison with young controls (p > 0.05). We also showed that the expression level of miR-181c was significantly increased in trehalose-treated rats (p < 0.01). However, analysis of miR-34c expression level indicated no significant difference between trehalose-treated old rats and non-treated old animals (p > 0.05). Our results indicated that trehalose treatment improved learning and memory function in aged rats by targeting miR-181c. Therefore, trehalose administration may provide a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate age-associated cognitive impairment.

AB  - Many difficulties related to using antibodies in diagnostic and therapeutic applications can sometimes be circumvented by using smaller, less complex single domain antibodies based on variable heavy chain (VH) domain constructs such as camelid VHH domains. However, VH domains have their own limitations, including an increased tendency to aggregate. VH domains often contain hydrophobic residues within their complementaritydetermining regions (CDRs) that facilitate binding to target antigens but can also mediate VH domain aggregation, which is a concern for therapeutic applications since this can trigger immune responses. In this study, we engineered the human VH-1Ba domain to improve its stability and solubility by introducing charged amino acids in the VH domain framework region and CDRH1. We followed two strategies to improve the stability and solubility of VH domains. First, we introduced positive and negatively charged amino acids in the framework region of an autonomous human VH domain (VH-B1a) and observed the effect of framework net charge on VH domain refolding, stability, and solubility. Introducing positive charge into the VH-B1a framework increased its thermostability but slightly lowered its refolding ability and solubility. We were not able to obtain correctly folded negatively charged (-VH) VH domains. Second, we introduced a series of positive and negatively charged amino acids in the CDRH1 loop of near-neutral (VH-B1a) and positively charged (+VH) VH domains, and observed their effect on expression, refolding, stability, and solubility. For both the VH-B1a and +VH domains, we observed a decrease in melting temperature (Tm) and room temperature solubility as more negative or positive charged amino acids were added to the CDRH1. The VH-B1a domain had higher room temperature solubility for negative and slightly positive CDRH1 net charges. The + VH domain had higher Tms for all CDRH1 net charges and was better able to tolerate the adverse effects of adding positive charge to CDRH1. We observed a similar response in refolding and solubility of VH-B1a and +VH in response to changes in CDRH1 net charge after temperature-induced denaturation for negative and neutral CDRH1s. We observed a positional effect with a single Lys (31K) and double Lys (31, 32 KK) substitutions in CDRH1, which promoted VH-B1a aggregation and was partially overcome by the +VH domain. In summary, this study provides information for designing VH domains with improved biophysical properties and a +VH domain that will be useful for applications where positive surface charge and CDRH1 are desirable.

AB  - More than 20 years have elapsed since the September 11, 2001 (9/11) terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC), Pentagon and at Shanksville, PA. Many persons continue to suffer a variety of physical and mental health conditions following their exposures to a mixture of incompletely characterized toxicants and psychological stressors at the terrorist attack sites. Primary care and specialized clinicians should ask patients who may have been present at any of the 9/11 sites about their 9/11 exposures, especially patients with cancer, respiratory symptoms, chronic rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, psychiatric symptoms, and substance use disorders. Clinicians, especially those in the NY metropolitan area, should know how to evaluate, diagnose, and treat patients with conditions that could be associated with exposure to the 9/11 attacks and its aftermath. As such, this issue of Archives contains a series of updates to clinical best practices relevant to medical conditions whose treatment is covered by the WTC Health Program. This first paper in the 14-part series describes the purpose of this series, defines the WTC Health Program and its beneficiaries, and explains how relevant Clinical Practice Guidelines were identified. This paper also reminds readers that because physical and mental health conditions are often intertwined, a coordinated approach to care usually works best and referral to health centers affiliated with the WTC Health Program may be necessary, since all such Centers offer multidisciplinary care.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Koreans consume more pork meat among the various meats, and as the consumption of pork meat increases, the amount of slaughtering is also increasing. Accordingly, the Korean government is sizing up and modernizing slaughterhouses to expedite the slaughter and to increase the safety of livestock products. The labor-intensive slaughter industry is undergoing major changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which will speed up the automation of slaughterhouses. Various automation devices are also being introduced in Korea, and currently the Korean government is introducing a pork meat yield grading machine to increase the accuracy of judgments based on the increasing slaughter volume. However, because such equipment is quite expensive, it is not easy to introduce, and a detailed study on the utility of the related equipment and an economic feasibility analysis has not been conducted. Therefore, in this study, we tried to prove the validity of the introduction of the equipment through the effectiveness study and economic analysis of the automatic meat yield grading machine, and a plan to increase the economic effect was considered.
   Currently, the pork industry is incorporating in-line automation with the aim of increasing the slaughtered pork carcass throughput while monitoring quality and safety. In Korea, 21 parameters (such as back-fat thickness and carcass weight) are used for quality grading of pork carcasses. Recently, the VCS2000 system-an automatic meat yield grading machine system-was introduced to enhance grading efficiency and therefore increase pork carcass production. The VCS2000 system is able to predict pork carcass yield based on image analysis. This study also conducted an economic analysis of the system using a cost-benefit analysis. The subsection items of the cost-benefit analysis considered were net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and benefit/cost ratio (BC ratio), and each method was verified through sensitivity analysis. For our analysis, the benefits were grouped into three categories: the benefits of reducing labor costs, the benefits of improving meat yield production, and the benefits of reducing pig feed consumption through optimization. The cost-benefit analysis of the system resulted in an NPV of approximately 615.6 million Korean won, an IRR of 13.52%, and a B/C ratio of 1.65.

AB  - Simple Summary Gentle touch has been repeatedly shown to have a positive effect on livestock. The purpose of this study was to determine potential changes in physiological indicators in lambs subjected to gentle stroking. A total of 40 lambs of two breeds were assigned to two control groups (n = 20) and two experimental groups (n = 20). Lambs from the experimental groups received treatment (the gentle stroking procedure). Analyses consisted of determining the following parameters: heart rate (HR), saturation (S) and biochemical analysis. An increase in cortisol levels and a decrease in total protein levels indicate a disruption of homeostasis. At the same time, a significant increase in glycogen and a significant decrease in glucose and heart rate values suggest reduced stress levels. The results obtained in the experimental groups suggest that interactions with humans, even of a positive nature, can be a source of stress, but this is a transient and adaptive reaction. Interactions with humans can be a source of stress, but long-term and positive ones will lead to positive changes and easier handling of animals.Abstract The aim of the study was to determine changes in physiological indicators in lambs subjected to gentle stroking. The study included 40 three-week-old lambs (20 females of the synthetic prolific-meat (BCP) line and 20 females of the Swiniarka (SW) breed). The animals were assigned to two control groups (n = 20) and two experimental groups (n = 20). Lambs from the experimental groups received treatment. Analyses consisted of determining the following parameters: heart rate (HR), saturation (S) and biochemical analysis. In the groups of sheep subjected to gentle massage, the analyses revealed a significant increase in the levels of cortisol, CAT, GST, GPx, among others, and a significant decrease in the levels of total protein, SOD, TAC, uric acid and Na+. At the same time, indicators of reduced stress levels were revealed, i.e., a significant increase in glycogen levels and a significant decrease in glucose and HR values. These results suggest that the introduction of gentle touch can induce positive states in lambs, and that the stress response may be transient and adaptive. Nevertheless, it is important to note that these interactions can be a source of stress, even if the behavioral response does not necessarily indicate stress.

AB  - For wide flange box sections, conventional Euler-Bernoulli beam theory with maintaining the cross-section planarity may lead to underestimation of axial stresses. Axial stresses in cross-section flanges may have a non-uniform distribution due to shear pliability, decreasing in value from the flange-web junction to the middle area of the flange. This phenomenon leads to the introduction of an effective flange width with a uniform distribution of original maximum stress. Furthermore, the introduction of flange curvature makes it even more complex due to the varying lever arm of each flange part with respect to the neutral bending axis. Because of this, in some cases, it is hard to predict where the flange's highest normal stress value will appear. In this paper, the shear lag effect on wide curved box sections is analyzed through parametric numerical analysis using the FEA software Dlubal RFEM 5, together with visual programming performed in Rhino Grasshopper. This study investigates the interaction of the shear lag effect and plane section hypothesis, which can be simplistically represented as a reduction in the impact of shear lag and the activation of a larger part of the flange of a wide-flange beam in the structural system of a continuous beam. The results suggest that for higher flange curvature and higher width to length ratio, this effect is more prominent.

AB  - Introduction: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy related to hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) is a surgically remediable epilepsy with a relatively high prevalence and psychiatric comorbidities. Depressive disorders may occur in up to 25% of MTLE-HS patients suggesting a common molecular mechanism underlying both conditions.
   Objective: To compare the gene expression comprising serotonin 5HT(1A) and 5HT(2A), noradrenaline (NA) ADRA1A, and ADRA2A receptors in the hippocampus of MTLE-HS patients with and without major depression.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study allocated 31 patients in three groups: MTLE-HS without psychiatric diagnosis (MTLE-HS group), MTLE-HS with major depression (MTLE-HS-D group) and a control group consisting of healthy volunteers without any neurological or psychiatric disorders. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared among groups. Gene expression of receptors were analyzed using general linear mixed models (GLMM), with an unstructured matrix, normal link.
   Results: The three groups showed a similar distribution regarding age, gender (p > 0.16), history of initial precipitating injury, family history of epilepsy, monthly frequency of seizures, side of hippocampal sclerosis, interictal spike distribution and anti-seizure medications did not differ between MTLE-HS and MTLE-HS-D groups (p > 0.05). We observed a greater expression of the 5HT1A receptor in the control group when compared to the MTLE-HS (P = .004) and MTLE-HS-D (P = .007). Nevertheless, we did not observe any difference when MTLE-HS and MTLE-HS-D groups were compared to the controls for the ADRA1A (P =.931; P = .931), ADRA2A (P = .120; P = .121) and 5HT2A (P = .638; P = .318, respectively) gene expression.
   Conclusion: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy related to hippocampal sclerosis and MTLE-HS-D patients showed a lowered expression of the 5HT1A receptors when compared with the controls adjusted for age and schooling. Data suggest that temporal lobe epilepsy plasticity may affect serotonin receptors, which may lead to more frequent cases of major depression in this population. More studies comprising wider samples are necessary to confirm these results; they also should investigate serotonin reuptake drugs as an adjuvant therapeutic option for MTLE-HS disorder.

AB  - Introduction: Heat stress is harmful to the health of humans and animals, more and more common, as a consequence of global warming, while the mechanism that heat stress modulates skeletal development remains unknown. Hence, we conducted a model of heat stress in vitro.Methods: We used Hu sheep myoblasts as the research object, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot (WB) were conducted to detect the expression of mRNA and protein in heat-stressed myoblasts. The would-healing assay was used to detect the migration of myoblasts. The mitochondria were observed by a transmission electron microscope.Results: mRNA and protein expression of HSP60 was significantly enriched in the heat-stressed myoblasts during proliferation and differentiation (p < 0.05). In our study, we indicated that heat stress enriched the intracellular ROS of the myoblasts (p < 0.001), leading to an increase in autophagy in the myoblasts to induce apoptosis. The results demonstrated that the protein expression of LC3B-1 and BCL-2 was significantly increased in myoblasts under heat stress during proliferation and differentiation (p < 0.05). Additionally, heat stress inhibited mitochondrial biogenesis and function and reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential and downregulated the expression of mtCo2, mtNd1 and DNM1L (p < 0.05) in myoblasts during proliferation and differentiation. Consequently, heat stress inhibited the proliferation and differentiation of the myoblasts, in accordance with the downregulation of the expression of PAX7, MYOD, MYF5, MYOG and MYHC (p < 0.05). Moreover, heat stress also inhibited the cell migration of the myoblasts.Discussion: This work demonstrates that heat stress inhibits proliferation and differentiation, and accelerates apoptosis by impairing mitochondrial function and promoting autophagy, which provides a mechanism to understand heat stress affects the development of the skeletal muscle.

AB  - At a time of climate change, farmers face difficulties in providing food for a growing population. This results in the overuse of water and fertilisers. The aim of the research was to test the possibility of introducing waste sheep wool fibres into a hydrogel to obtain a stable material that could improve water retention and could serve as a fertiliser material matrix. Wool fibres and hydrogel were chosen because of their ability to store water and their degradability. An evaluation of the swelling degree of different alginate-based hydrogel matrices was performed to select the matrix. The stability and water bonding of hydrogels with different wool fibre content were analysed and evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The microstructure and the effect of fibres on the uniformity of the hydrogel were assessed using SEM and optical microscopy. The degree of water retention in the soil was also evaluated. The results showed that it is possible to incorporate wool fibres into the hydrogel matrix and the wool fibres make the composite porous, which allows water penetration into the material much more easily. This research has shown the possibility of using waste wool fibres as an active ingredient in sustainable fertiliser materials.

AB  - Late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans is the most destructive disease of potatoes worldwide and is most notable as the cause of the Irish potato famine of the mid 1840's. Whole mitochondrial genome sequences were generated from 44 Australian, two UK and one US isolates of P. infestans stored as either herbarium specimens or as recent samples on FTA cards, spanning the period 1873-2019. Mitochondrial (mt) genome sequence comparison confirmed that over the past c. 110 years, an old A1 strain of P. infestans has been present in Australia. There was evidence, however, that P. infestans had been introduced on multiple separate occasions in the early 1900s prior to the introduction of quarantine measures. The 44 Australian samples included six infected specimens of the Australian native kangaroo apple (Solanum aviculare) collected in 1911. The P. infestans mt genome sequences from these isolates clustered with P. infestans from infected potatoes collected in Victoria (1910, 1911, 1986, 1989), South Australia (1909, 2003) and Tasmania (1910, 2019), supporting the hypothesis that Australia has one old strain that has survived since the first arrival of the pathogen into the country. The study highlights the success of Australia's potato biosecurity setting and supports the need for ongoing surveillance and biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction of the newer more aggressive strains of the pathogen.

AB  - Introduction: Decaploid Camellia hainanica is a new tea oil Camellia species discovered in recent years that is unique to Hainan. This species has high nutritional and medicinal value and shows strong adaptability in the growth process. Mitochondria play an important role in plant cells and have an independent genetic system. Therefore, assembling and annotating the mitochondrial genome function of decaploid C. hainanica is of great significance. Methods: This study successfully assembled the mitochondrial genome of decaploid C. hainanica and comprehensively annotated its functional genes using the Nanopore sequencing platform. Results: Results showed that the mitochondrial genome is 902,617 bp in length, with a typical circular structure and a guanine-cytosine content of 45.79%. The genome encodes 64 protein-coding genes and contains a total of 76 genes, including 40 mRNA, 32 tRNA, 3 rRNA, and 1 pseudogene. Tetranucleotide repeats accounted for 38.60% of the simple sequence repeats. Only two genes, atp6 and sdh4, had a Ka/Ks ratio <1, whereas the Pi value of the sdh3 gene had a maximum of 0.00374 in these regions, suggesting that the sdh3 gene can be used as a molecular marker for the analysis of the mitochondrial genome of C. hainanica. From the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis, 29 codons had RSCU values >1, 27 of which (93%) ended in A or U, indicating a bias for A/U endings is present in C. hainanica. During RNA editing, 48.24% (260 loci) of amino acids were changed from hydrophilic to hydryophobic, resulting in an increase in the hydrophobicity of the protein. Comparative analysis identified 34 homologous fragments between the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes, with the longest fragment being 9,572 bp in length. Phylogenetic analysis of the genomes showed that the Hainanese and Vietnamese varieties of tea oil Camellia are sister species. Discussion: Results confirmed that the mitochondrial genomes of Hainanese and Vietnamese tea oil Camellia underwent gene rearrangement. Results also provided key data support for the utilization and conservation of tea oil germplasm resources and the breeding of varieties and are of great significance for promoting genetic evolution research, genetic breeding, and identification of tea oil Camellia.

AB  - Background As one of the world's most important beverage crops, tea plants (Camellia sinensis) are renowned for their unique flavors and numerous beneficial secondary metabolites, attracting researchers to investigate the formation of tea quality. With the increasing availability of transcriptome data on tea plants in public databases, conducting large-scale co-expression analyses has become feasible to meet the demand for functional characterization of tea plant genes. However, as the multidimensional noise increases, larger-scale co-expression analyses are not always effective. Analyzing a subset of samples generated by effectively downsampling and reorganizing the global sample set often leads to more accurate results in co-expression analysis. Meanwhile, global-based co-expression analyses are more likely to overlook condition-specific gene interactions, which may be more important and worthy of exploration and research. Results Here, we employed the k-means clustering method to organize and classify the global samples of tea plants, resulting in clustered samples. Metadata annotations were then performed on these clustered samples to determine the "conditions" represented by each cluster. Subsequently, we conducted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) separately on the global samples and the clustered samples, resulting in global modules and cluster-specific modules. Comparative analyses of global modules and cluster-specific modules have demonstrated that cluster-specific modules exhibit higher accuracy in co-expression analysis. To measure the degree of condition specificity of genes within condition-specific clusters, we introduced the correlation difference value (CDV). By incorporating the CDV into co-expression analyses, we can assess the condition specificity of genes. This approach proved instrumental in identifying a series of high CDV transcription factor encoding genes upregulated during sustained cold treatment in Camellia sinensis leaves and buds, and pinpointing a pair of genes that participate in the antioxidant defense system of tea plants under sustained cold stress. Conclusions To summarize, downsampling and reorganizing the sample set improved the accuracy of co-expression analysis. Cluster-specific modules were more accurate in capturing condition-specific gene interactions. The introduction of CDV allowed for the assessment of condition specificity in gene co-expression analyses. Using this approach, we identified a series of high CDV transcription factor encoding genes related to sustained cold stress in Camellia sinensis. This study highlights the importance of considering condition specificity in co-expression analysis and provides insights into the regulation of the cold stress in Camellia sinensis.

AB  - FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), belonging to the FT/TFL1 gene family, is an important gene regulating the flowering transition and inflorescence architecture during plant development. Given its importance to plant adaptation and crop improvement, FT has been extensively studied in related plant research; however, the specific role and underlying molecular mechanisms of FT in the continuous flowering of perennial plants remains elusive. Here, we isolated and characterized homologous FT genes from two Camellia species with different flowering-period phenotypes: CaFT was isolated from Camellia azalea, a precious species blooming in summer and flowering throughout the year, and CjFT was isolated from C. japonica, which blooms in winter and spring. The major difference in the genes between the two species was an additional five-amino acid repeat sequence in C. japonica. FT showed high expression levels in the leaves in both species from January to August, especially in April for C. japonica and in May for C. azalea. CaFT was expressed throughout the year in C. azalea, whereas CjFT was not expressed from September to December in C. japonica. The expression levels of FT in the floral buds were generally higher than those in the leaves. Overexpression of CaFT and CjFT in Arabidopsis indicated that both genes can activate downstream genes to promote flowering. Transgenic callus tissue was obtained by introducing the two genes into C. azalea through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transcriptome and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that both florigen FT genes promoted the expression of downstream genes such as AP1, FUL, and SEP3, and slightly up-regulated the expression of upstream genes such as CO and GI. The above results indicated that CaFT and CjFT played a role in promoting flowering in both camellia species. The expression pattern of CaFT in leaves suggested that, compared to CjFT, CaFT may be related to the annual flowering of C. azalea.

AB  - The entorhinal cortex serves as a major gateway connecting the hippocampus and neocortex, playing a pivotal role in episodic memory formation. Neurons in the entorhinal cortex exhibit two notable features associated with temporal information processing: a population-level ability to encode long temporal signals and a single-cell characteristic known as graded-persistent activity, where some neurons maintain activity for extended periods even without external inputs. However, the relationship between these single-cell characteristics and population dynamics has remained unclear, largely due to the absence of a framework to describe the dynamics of neural populations with highly heterogeneous time scales. To address this gap, we extend the dynamical mean field theory, a powerful framework for analyzing large-scale population dynamics, to study the dynamics of heterogeneous neural populations. By proposing an analytically tractable model of graded-persistent activity, we demonstrate that the introduction of graded-persistent neurons shifts the chaos-order phase transition point and expands the network's dynamical region, a preferable region for temporal information computation. Furthermore, we validate our framework by applying it to a system with heterogeneous adaptation, demonstrating that such heterogeneity can reduce the dynamical regime, contrary to previous simplified approximations. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for understanding the functional advantages of diversity in biological systems and offer insights applicable to a wide range of heterogeneous networks beyond neural populations.

We altered EF-Tu in A. tumefaciens to reduce PTI and improved transformation efficiency.center dot A robust computational pipeline was established to detect EF-Tu protein variation in a large set of plant bacterial species and identified EF-Tu variants from bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 that allow the pathogen to escape EFR perception. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains were engineered to substitute EF-Tu with DC3000 variants and examined their transformation efficiency in plants.center dot Elongation factor Tu variants with rarely occurred amino acid residues were identified within DC3000 EF-Tu that mitigates recognition by EFR. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains were engineered by expressing DC3000 EF-Tu instead of native agrobacterial EF-Tu and resulted in decreased plant immunity detection.center dot These engineered A. tumefaciens strains displayed an increased efficiency in transient expression in both Arabidopsis thaliana and Camelina sativa. The results support the potential application of these strains as improved vehicles to introduce transgenic alleles into members of the Brassicaceae family.

AB  - Spinescence-characterized by spines, prickles, and thorns-is a key defensive trait in plants, but is rare among bamboo genera. Its evolutionary history in bamboos remains poorly understood due to limited fossil evidence, with only a single previously documented specimen of a preserved node. Furthermore, the evolutionary ecology and paleoclimatic adaptations of bamboos during the Quaternary in Asia remain unclear due to a lack of fossil records. This study introduces Chimonobambusa manipurensis sp. nov., a well-preserved thorny bamboo fossil from the late Pleistocene of eastern India, marking the first Asian fossil record of thorny bamboo and the first Quaternary record from Asia. The fossil features nodes, internodes, nodal buds, and thorn scars, offering novel insights into bamboo spinescence and nodal morphology. C. manipurensis displays three well-preserved nodes, two complete internodes, prominently conserved nodal buds, and 3-4 thorn base scars along each nodal rim. Morphologically, it shares traits seen in modern Chimonobambusa Makino and is placed within the same genus. Together with a Pliocene-Pleistocene thorny bamboo record from Peru, this discovery suggests spinescence in bamboos likely emerged during the Neogene, with evolutionary adaptations continuing into the Pleistocene potentially as an adaptation to changing climatic conditions and increased herbivory pressures. Furthermore, it suggests that bamboos during Quaternary time in Asia were growing under warm and humid climatic conditions. This finding enhances our understanding of bamboo morphological evolution and paleoclimatic adaptations, filling a critical gap in the global fossil record.

AB  - This study aimed to improve the inoculation procedure with Sphacelotheca reiliana to identify germplasms susceptible to head smut of maize. During Phase 1, 1.5 g of spores were introduced into a substrate roll, which was then sown at 15, 20, 25, and 30 days after inoculation in a spore-free field. During Phase 2, 15 hybrids were planted on three dates in a field with head smut disease record. The tassel and ear were examined, and the number of infected plants was registered. In Phase 1, all hybrids showed the highest infection rates 25 days after inoculation. In Phase 2, the highest infection percentage was observed on the first date (32.5%). Experimental hybrids 1 and 2 and hybrid DK357 showed the highest infection percentages, whereas hybrids DK2037 and DK2061 showed the lowest infection percentages. On the second date, 10 hybrids were susceptible to infection, while on the third date, the hybrids showed low infection percentages or were not infected. The disease response in the Cimarron, Experimental 3, and Antelope hybrids was relatively constant over the first two planting dates. The experimental hybrids and P4063W showed high infection percentages. On the first date, the Experimental 3, Experimental 2, P4063W and Experimental 1 hybrids showed infection percentages of 77, 65, 62 and 46%, respectively. On the second date, these percentages changed to 49, 35, 41 and 48%, respectively. The proposed inoculation method is more effective and can be employed a lower cost and with less infrastructure than previous methods.

AB  - Incorporating blast furnace slag into the composition of paving concrete can be one of the cost-effective ways to completely eliminate by-products from the pig iron production process (approximately 70% granulated slag and 30% air-cooled slag). The possibility to reintroduce blast furnace slag back into the life cycle will provide significant support to current environmental concerns and the clearance of tailings landfills. Especially in recent years, granulated and ground blast furnace slag (GGBS) as a substitute for cement and air-cooled blast furnace slag (ACBFS) aggregates as a substitute for natural aggregates in the composition of concretes have been studied by many researchers. But concrete compositions with large amounts of incorporated blast furnace slag affect the mechanical and durability properties through the interaction between the slag, cement and water depending on the curing times. This study focuses on identifying the optimal proportions of GGBS as a supplementary cementitious material (SCM) and ACBFS aggregates as a substitute to natural sand such that the performance at 90 days of curing the concrete is similar to that of the control concrete. In addition, to minimize the costs associated with grinding GGBS, the hydration activity index (HAI) of the GGBS, the surface morphology, and the mineral components were analyzed via X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDX), and nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry (NMR). The flexural strength, the basic mechanical property of road concretes, increased from 28 to 90 days by 20.72% and 20.26% for the slag concrete but by 18.58% for the reference concrete. The composite with 15% GGBS and 25% ACBFS achieved results similar to the reference concrete at 90 days; therefore, they are considered optimal percentages to replace cement and natural sand in ecological pavement concretes. The HAI of the slag powder with a specific surface area equivalent to that of Portland cement fell into strength class 80 at the age of 28 days, but at the age of 90 days, the strength class was 100. The results of this research present three important benefits: the first is the protection of the environment through the recycling of two steel industry wastes that complies with European circular economy regulations, and the second is linked to the consequent savings in the disposal costs associated with wastefully occupied warehouses and the savings in slag grinding.

AB  - With the rapid increase in electric vehicle (EV) ownership, the uncertainty of EV charging demand has become a significant concern, especially in distributed photovoltaic (PV) power distribution networks (DNs) with high penetration rates. This growing demand presents challenges in meeting the needs of EV owners and grid charging/discharging stations (GCDSs), jeopardizing the stability, efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of the DNs. To address these challenges, this study introduces innovative models, the anchoring effect, and regret theory for EV demand response (DR) decision-making, focusing on dual-sided demand management for GCDSs and EVs. The proposed model leverages the light spectrum optimizer-convolutional neural network to predict PV output and utilizes Monte Carlo simulation to estimate EV charging load, ensuring precise PV output prediction and effective EV distribution. To optimize DR decisions for EVs, this study employs time-of-use guidance optimization through a logistic-sine hybrid chaotic-hippopotamus optimizer (LSC-HO). By integrating the anchoring effect and regret theory model with LSC-HO, this approach enhances satisfaction levels for GCDSs by balancing DR, enhancing voltage quality within the DNs. Simulations on a modified IEEE-33 system confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach, validating the efficiency of the optimal scheduling methods and enhancing the stable operation, efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of the DNs.

AB  - Soil contamination with heavy metals is one of the most important threats to the environment because they are easily incorporated into the food chain, threatening the health of plants, animals, and humans. In this study, the effectiveness of the introduced substances (compost and fly ash) was assessed in terms of its influence on the content of Cu and Zn in the soil, potential accumulation of these metals in the cultivated plants (camelina and oat), and thus in food products prepared from these plants. Therefore, the following indicators were used: bioconcentration factors calculated for the total amount (BCFT) and bioavailable amount of metals (BCFB) as well as gender-estimated daily intake (EDI) and health risk index (HRI). Regardless of gender, the EDI values ranged from 0.31 mu g center dot kg(-1) to 0.49 mu g center dot kg(-1) for Cu and from 0.9 mu g center dot kg(-1) to 1.8 mu g center dot kg(-1) for Zn in oat. For camelina, the calculated values were as follows: 4.1-8.5 mu g center dot kg(-1) for Cu and 7.1-12.1 mu g center dot kg(-1) for Zn. The HRI values were very low (in general 0.03-0.2), indicating no health risk connected with potential consumption of oat or camelina food products. The amounts of Cu and Zn in the crops grown on the soil amended with compost or fly ash were significantly lower (by 21-37% for oat and 14-34% for camelina) compared to the content of these metals in the control plants. Moreover, the levels of bioavailable metals decreased in soil as a result of the applied immobilizing agents. The study showed that the immobilization efficiency of compost and fly ash was comparable, and therefore the choice of either of these substances for the chemical remediation of soil contaminated with heavy metals is justified.

AB  - Introduction: The technology in the automotive industry is becoming increasingly safer in the age of auto-mated driving, but the number of accidents is still high, especially in wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs). To better avoid these accidents, patterns involved in these accidents must be detected. Method: This paper presents a spatiotemporal risk prediction of WVCs, including various road and environmental char-acteristics. A process of data preparation using GIS automated by Python scripts was developed to enable a spatiotemporal link of diverse features for the subsequent predictive data analysis. Different machine learning (ML) approaches were applied-random forest (RF), feedforward neural networks (FNN), and support vector machine classifier (SVM) -including automated ML to predict the risk of WVCs. Therefore, a dataset of approximately 731,000 accidents reported to the police in Bavaria over a period of 10 years (2010-2019) was used. In addition, non-accidents were randomly generated in Python over time and space for the supervised ML processes. As the actual risk probability for WVCs and non-WVCs is not entirely known, the impact of different training ratios between accidents and non -accidents was tested on the risk prediction quality (RPQ) (25%, 50%, 75%, 90% WVCs) of the double -weighted sensitivity and single-weighted specificity rate. Results: The test yielded high mean values of RPQ as an indicator for a suitable WVC prediction. Both RF (86.6%) and FNN (86.7%) were identified as suitable choices for WVC risk prediction in terms of RPQ. The SVM yielded a lower prediction quality, even though acceptable results could be achieved within a shorter runtime. Practical Applications: Spatial transferability was verified since the algorithm was trained on the dataset of Bavaria (excluding Upper Bavaria) and successfully tested in Upper Bavaria. WVC forecasts were also proven through train-ing with datasets from 2010-2017 and in prediction for 2018 and 2019.(c) 2022 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The chestnut weevil, Curculio davidi Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a major pest of chestnuts. Damage caused by C. davidi has increased as beetle populations have expanded. To promote effective C. davidi management practices based on its host plant, we compared the susceptibility of local chestnut cultivar 'Qinli 2'(QL2) and introduced chestnut cultivar 'Hongli' (HL) in Qinling Mountains to this weevil. Number of eggs laid by C. davidi females in HL was significantly higher than that of QL2. Chestnut weevil females laid 6.25-fold and 3-fold more eggs in HL than QL2 in the choice tests and no-choice tests, respectively. From 2021 to 2023, C. davidi infestation rates of HL were significantly higher than that of QL2 in the field. HL was smaller, softer, and have lower cellulose content as compared with QL2. HL contained 4.61%, 13.76%, 10.09%, 26.53%, 9.24%, 18.4%, 6.28%, and 23.26% higher amounts of N, K, Ca, Mg, S, Na, Mn, and Cu respectively, than QL2. In contrast, QL2 contained 25.28%, 19.80%, and 16.83% higher amounts of Al, B, and Fe, than HL. Our results revealed that the introduced chestnut cultivar is more susceptible to C. davidi compared to the local chestnut cultivar in Qinling Mountain, which was associated with several physico-chemical changes in chestnuts. These findings may contribute to the future efforts for breeding of C. davidi-resistant chestnut cultivars.

AB  - Featured Application This manuscript studies the feasibility of combining anaerobic digestion with high temperature and pressure treatments to reduce the final amount of digestate requiring disposal and to produce a material with higher added value. However, thermal treatments present high energy demand and installation costs. This research is a preliminary study performed to evaluate different process configurations and establish strategies for reducing the thermal demand of the combined approach. Anaerobic digestion is a biological process with wide application for the treatment of high organic-containing streams. The production of biogas and the lack of oxygen requirements are the main energetic advantages of this process. However, the digested stream may not readily find a final disposal outlet under certain circumstances. The present manuscript analyzed the feasibility of valorizing digestate by the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) process. A hypothetical plant treating cattle manure and cheese whey as co-substrate (25% v/w, wet weight) was studied. The global performance was evaluated using available data reported in the literature. The best configuration was digestion as a first stage with the subsequent treatment of digestate in an HTC unit. The treatment of manure as sole substrate reported a value of 752 m(3)/d of biogas which could be increased to 1076 m(3)/d (43% increase) when coupling an HTC unit for digestate post-treatment and the introduction of the co-substrate. However, the high energy demand of the combined configurations indicated, as the best alternative, the valorization of just a fraction (15%) of digestate to provide the benefits of enhancing biogas production. This configuration presented a much better energy performance than the thermal hydrolysis pre-treatment of manure. The increase in biogas production does not compensate for the high energy demand of the pre-treatment unit. However, several technical factors still need further research to make this alternative a reality, as it is the handling and pumping of high solid slurries that significantly affects the energy demand of the thermal treatment units and the possible toxicity of hydrochar when used in a biological process.

AB  - Flexible and piezoelectric hydrogels show great potential in the fields of wearable sensors, soft robotics, and the human-machine interface. However, these existing piezoelectric hydrogel sensors lack adhesive properties to the skin, limiting their further application. Here, by introducing the methacryloxyethyltrimethylammonium chloride (DMC) and the sodium p-styrenesulfonate (NaSS) into the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) piezoelectric hydrogel, a polyelectrolyte hydrogel (PN(x)D(y)A(z)) was prepared through the electrostatic interaction between the polyelectrolytes. The obtained hydrogels exhibited good mechanical properties (fracture stress and fracture strain were 140.65 +/- 4.52 kPa and 499 +/- 9.54%, respectively) and excellent adhesion (adhesion to pig skin surface was 22.78 kPa), excellent mechanical-electric response performance, and could produce stable electrical signal output (similar to 65 mV) during 3000 stress-discharge cycles. When used as a flexible strain sensor, the PN(x)D(y)A(z) hydrogel accurately monitors a variety of body signals and exhibits excellent biocompatibility. Therefore, the flexible and piezoelectric PN(x)D(y)A(z) hydrogel will have broad application prospects in the field of soft electronics.

AB  - The lower group of subterranean termites, Coptotermes gestroi (C. gestroi), and the higher groups, Globitermes sulphureus (G. sulphureus) and Macrotermes gilvus (M. gilvus), were bait treated in a no-choice laboratory bioassay using multiple active ingredients (chlorfluazuron, hexaflumuron, and bistrifluron) in Chitin Synthesis Inhibitor (CSI) baits in individual separated petri dishes. The mortality rate for each sample group was observed daily for four weeks. After one week of bait introduction, the record showed the acceleration of mortality rate in M. gilvus, followed by C. gestroi and G. sulphureus. Within four treatment weeks, C. gestroi and M. gilvus reached the complete mortality. The Tukey's post-hoc test revealed the significant differences between the mortality rate of G. sulphureus and those of C. gestroi and M. gilvus in response to chlorfluazuron and bistrifluron (p < 0.01). No significant differences in the mortality rate were observed among these three termite species when hexaflumuron was used. Additionally, the observation of the feeding activity indicated significant differences among all species in response to hexaflumuron and bistrifluron (p < 0.01). As for the case of chlorfluazuron, the feeding activity of G. sulphureus and M. gilvus under the treatment of this substance did not show any significant difference. The correlation analysis further revealed that both the study variables were distantly related. In conclusion, the mortality rates of the three termite species tested in this study were recorded after four weeks of CSI-bait bioassay.

AB  - Reticulitermes flavipes is the most invasive species in its genus and is responsible for causing significant damage to human structures in areas where it has been introduced. Although it has already become established in Chile and Uruguay, it had not previously been reported in Argentina. In this study, we report the first detection of this species in Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina. The colony was already producing alates, and species identification was confirmed through both morphology and mitochondrial gene 16S rRNA analysis. Our results, while not conclusive, suggest that this introduction was independent from the one that occurred in Chile and Uruguay, and potentially originated from the United States. The detection of R. flavipes in Argentina is significant because it highlights the potential for this species to establish itself in new regions and underscores the need for future research on and control of R. flavipes in this country.

AB  - Pieris brassicae (Linnaeus, 1758) (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), commonly known as the cabbage butterfly, is a major herbivorous pest causing significant damage to Brassica crops, which are widely cultivated for edible parts and economic uses such as oilseed production. Conventional chemical-based pest control methods pose risks to environmental and human health, prompting interest in sustainable alternatives like biological control using parasitoids. This study evaluated crop damage by P. brassicae larvae and the potential of the larval parasitoid Cotesia vestalis (Haliday, 1834) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in managing pest populations. Larvae and fertilized eggs of P. brassicae were collected and reared on four host diets (cabbage, cauliflower, turnip, and generic brassica) under controlled laboratory conditions. Larval growth, feeding behavior, and development were assessed, along with a feeding index for dietary efficiency. Parasitisation was introduced by exposing larvae to adult C. vestalis, and host-parasitoid interactions were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA and regression models. Results revealed that larvae had the highest feeding preference and weight gain on brassica, while turnip-fed larvae consumed the least. Parasitisation by C. vestalis significantly suppressed larval development, with a strong correlation between parasitisation rates and reduced host fitness. These findings highlight C. vestalis as a promising biological control agent for P. brassicae, offering an effective and eco-friendly alternative to chemical pesticides. Further research should focus on optimizing C. vestalis mass-rearing protocols and release strategies tailored to diverse Brassica cropping systems to promote sustainable pest management.

AB  - The Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki, is both an economically impactful pest and a successful invader. One method of subterranean termite control is baiting. According to the label, baits are installed surrounding the structure at a uniform interval distance of approximate to 3 m. However, homeowners and pest control professionals are often concerned that termites may bypass bait stations and have access to the structure. To address this concern, we experimentally duplicated feld conditions using a large planar arena (3.6 m x 1.1 m) to study the optimal distribution of bait stations based on colony-wide foraging activity. We installed 2 bait stations 3 m apart as per label instructions and introduced C. formosanus colonies to allow them to explore the arena by tunneling through the sand. In this real-scale arena, all termite colonies intercepted a bait station in an average of 21 (+/- 8 SD) days. We assumed that termites could fnd bait faster if there were more bait stations by overlaying additional hypothetical baits closer than per label instruction, but the improvement was incremental, requiring 4 times more stations (0.45 m interval) to obtain a signifcant difference. We also revealed the characteristic behavior after intercepting bait stations, termites created a burst of tunnels that radiated from the bait station. These branching tunnels averaged 16 cm in length, suggesting immediate interceptions of additional auxiliary stations placed within 16 cm of an active station. These fndings contribute to our understanding on how subterranean termites intercept inground bait stations

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the neuro-developmental disorder caused by various changes in the brain. It affects the life conditions with social interaction and communication. Most of the previous researches used the various techniques for the early detection to reduce the ASD, but it had been occurred several complications such as, time expenses, and low accessibility for diagnosis.This paper aims to develop the JSTO-DenseNetmodel is for the detection of ASD. In this paper, an input autism brainimage is considered as an input applied to image preprocessing phase. In image pre-processing, the clatters are removed utilizing Gaussian filtering and also, Region of Interest (ROI) extraction is carried out. Thereafter, extraction of pivotal region is done based on functional connectivity utilizing proposed Jaya Sewing Training Optimization (JSTO). The JSTO is newly introduced by combining Jaya algorithm and Sewing Training-Based Optimization (STBO). Thus, output-1 is obtained. In feature extraction phase, grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features like entropy, correlation, energy, homogeneity, inverse difference moment, Angular second moment and texture features namelylocal ternary patterns (LTP), Local Optimal Oriented Pattern (LOOP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) are extracted from the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Therefore, output-2 is obtained. From output-1 and output-2, ASD classification is accomplished using DenseNet, which is trained employing same proposed JSTO. The proposed JSTO-DenseNet model achieves the highest accuracy of 94.8 %, True Positive Rate (TPR) of 90%, True Negative Rate (TNR) of 90.5%, un-weighted average recall (UAR) of 89.8% and the lowest False Negative Rate (FNR) of 86.7%, and False Positive Rate of 82.6%, when compared with other traditional methods like, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), Hybrid deep lightweight feature generator, CLAttention, Two stream end-to-end deep learning (DL), Auto-Encoder feature representation, and Fuzzy Inference Gait System-Deep Extreme Adaptive Fuzzy (FIGS-DEAF) based on Abide 1 dataset.

AB  - Camelina sativa (camelina) is emerging as an alternative oilseed crop due to its short growing cycle, low input requirements, adaptability to less favorable growing environments and a seed oil profile suitable for biofuel and industrial applications. Camelina meal and oil are also registered for use in animal and fish feeds; however, like meals derived from most cereals and oilseeds, it is deficient in certain essential amino acids, such as lysine. In higher plants, the reaction catalyzed by dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) is the first committed step in the biosynthesis of lysine and is subject to regulation by lysine through feedback inhibition. Here, we report enhancement of lysine content in C. sativa seed via expression of a feedback inhibition-insensitive form of DHDPS from Corynebacterium glutamicums (CgDHDPS). Two genes encoding C. sativa DHDPS were identified and the endogenous enzyme is partially insensitive to lysine inhibition. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to examine the impact of alterations, alone and in combination, present in lysine-desensitized DHDPS isoforms from Arabidopsis thaliana DHDPS (W53R), Nicotiana tabacum (N80I) and Zea mays (E84K) on C. sativa DHDPS lysine sensitivity. When introduced alone, each of the alterations decreased sensitivity to lysine; however, enzyme specific activity was also affected. There was evidence of molecular or structural interplay between residues within the C. sativa DHDPS allosteric site as coupling of the W53R mutation with the N80V mutation decreased lysine sensitivity of the latter, but not to the level with the W53R mutation alone. Furthermore, the activity and lysine sensitivity of the triple mutant (W53R/N80V/E84T) was similar to the W53R mutation alone or the C. glutamicum DHDPS. The most active and most lysine-insensitive C. sativa DHDPS variant (W53R) was not inhibited by free lysine up to 1 mM, comparable to the C. glutamicums enzyme. Seed lysine content increased 13.6 -22.6% in CgDHDPS transgenic lines and 7.6-13.2% in the mCsDHDPS lines. The high lysine-accumulating lines from this work may be used to produce superior quality animal feed with improved essential amino acid profile.

AB  - YAP is a transcription cofactor in the Hippo pathway that interacts with the TEAD family of transcription factors in the nucleus to promote CTGF expression and stimulate cell growth. YAP hyperactivation is frequently observed in fibrotic diseases. The main kinases in the Hippo pathway, MST1/2, a member of the STE20 family, promote Lats phosphorylation, leading to YAP phosphorylation, which prevents its nuclear entry and thus inhibits cell growth. High cell density induces Lats phosphorylation, causing YAP phosphorylation and its exclusion from the nucleus. Additionally, energy stress, such as glucose deprivation, induces AMPK phosphorylation, which also prevents YAP from entering the nucleus. MST3, another member of the STE20 family, has been shown to regulate cell apoptosis, migration, polarization, and ion homeostasis in previous studies. We hypothesized that MST3 is involved in Hippo pathway-mediated fibrosis. To test this, we overexpressed HA-tagged MST3 (HA-MST3) and a kinase-dead mutant (HA-MST3-KD) in MDCK cells. When cells reached a high density, HA-MST3 was activated to phosphorylate YAP, promoting its nuclear exit and inhibiting cell growth. In contrast, HA-MST3-KD cells showed reduced phosphorylated YAP, resulting in YAP retention in the nucleus, continuous cell growth, and NIH/3T3 cell fibrosis. Interestingly, YAP did not exit the nucleus in HA-MST3KD cells treated with the YAP inhibitor verteporfin, but it did exit under metformin treatment due to energy stress, accompanied by increased AMPK and YAP phosphorylation, which inhibited MST3-KD-mediated fibrosis. These findings suggest that metformininduced AMPK activation could provide a therapeutic approach for MST3-KD-mediated fibrosis.

AB  - The production of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is seriously threatened by various leaf-feeding insects, and wild soybean [Glycine soja Sieb. & Zucc.] has a greater resistance capacity and genetic diversity. In this study, a natural population consisting of 121 wild soybean accessions was used for detecting insect resistance genes. The larval weight (LW) of the common cutworm (CCW), the resistance level (RL) and the index of damaged leaf (IDL) were evaluated as resistance indicators to herbivores. An association synonymous SNP AX-94083016 located in the coding region of the respiratory burst oxidase gene GsRbohA1 was identified by genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses. The overexpression of GsRbohA1 in soybean hairy roots enhanced resistance to CCW. One SNP in the promoter region cosegregated with AX-94083016 contributing to soybean resistance to CCW by altering GsRbohA1 gene expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Two major haplotypes, GsRbohA1(A) and GsRbohA1(G), were identified based on the SNP. The resistant haplotype GsRbohA1(A) predominates in wild soybeans, although it has been gradually lost in landraces and cultivars. The nucleotide diversity around GsRbohA1 is much lower in landraces and cultivars than in its ancestors. In conclusion, a new resistant haplotype, GsRbohA1(A), was identified in wild soybean, which will be a valuable gene resource for soybean insect resistance breeding through introducing into improvement lines, and it offers a strategy for exploring resistance gene resources from its wild relatives.

AB  - Heteromormyrus Steindachner, 1866, a genus of Mormyridae (Teleostei: Osteoglossomorpha), has been monotypic since the description of Heteromormyrus pauciradiatus (Steindacher, 1866) from a single specimen. No type locality other than "Angola" was given and almost no specimens have been subse-quently identified to this species. In order to investigate the relationship of this taxon to fresh specimens collected in Angola and elsewhere, whole genome paired-end sequencing of DNA extracted from the holotype specimen of Heteromormyrus pauciradiatus was performed and a nearly complete mitogenome assembled from the sequences obtained. Comparison of cytochrome oxidase I and cytochrome b sequences from this mitogenome to sequences from recently collected material reveal that Heteromormyrus pauciradiatus is closely related to specimens identified as Hippopotamyrus ansorgii (Boulenger, 1905), Hippopotamyrus szaboi Kramer, van der Bank & Wink, 2004, Hippopotamyrus longilateralis Kramer & Swartz, 2010, as well as to several undescribed forms from subequatorial Africa collectively referred to in the literature as the "Hippopotamyrus ansorgii species complex" and colloquially known as "slender stonebashers." Previous molecular phylogenetic work has shown that these species are not close relatives of Hippopotamyrus castor Pappenheim, 1906, the type species of genus Hippopotamyrus Pappenheim, 1906 from Cameroon, and are thus misclassified. Hippopotamyrus ansorgii species complex taxa and another species shown to have been misclassified, Paramormyrops tavernei (Poll, 1972), are placed in genus Heteromormyrus and one genetic lineage from the Kwanza and Lucala rivers of Angola are identified as conspecific Heteromormyrus pauciradiatus. Three additional new combinations and a synonymy in Mormyridae are introduced. The morphological characteristics and geographical distribution of the genus Heteromormyrus are reviewed. The electric organ discharges (EODs) of Heteromormyrus species are to be treated in a separate study.

AB  - Introduction Market-driven poaching and unsustainable wildlife harvest are significant drivers of population decline for numerous plant and animal species, including high-profile species like Asian and African elephants, wild cats, sharks and rays, and pangolins. This publication reviews the emerging role of conservation technology in combating this trade.Technologies and applications We showcase how innovative technological tools are revolutionizing the detection and disruption of illegal and unsustainable wildlife trade, with a focus on those available to frontline staff working to prevent poaching and trafficking from source sites. We consider a diverse array of deployed technologies ranging from open-source software platforms, AI, and mobile apps to cutting-edge hardware, including camera traps, acoustic sensors, and remote sensing tools.Case studies To demonstrate the complex threats posed by IUWT to wildlife and the consequent need for tailored solutions, we present two case studies, one terrestrial and one marine, showcasing the importance of appropriate suites of technology tools for conservation implementation.Discussion Technology has potential to empower rangers, park staff, wildlife and fisheries inspectors, customs officials, police, and conservation practitioners with unprecedented capabilities to monitor threatened wildlife, detect illegal activities, gather evidence, and support law enforcement interventions.

AB  - Translocation of threatened terrestrial orchids is increasingly seen as a viable ameliorative conservation option when habitat is destroyed or modified through changing land use. Most orchid translocations reported in the literature detail nursery-raised seedlings planted into intact and suitable habitat, and few involve translocation of entire plants and their mycorrhizal fungal associates. As part of a larger translocation study, soil cores containing 46 individuals of the threatened Painted Diuris (Diuris tricolor) were translocated into herbivore-proof plots on restored and rehabilitated post-mining lands in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. After 3 years of annual flowering and fruiting, new recruits (mature flowering plants) were observed within translocation plots but outside of original soil cores, and at 6 years following translocation 29 new individuals were observed. Two of these individuals germinated outside of fenced plots. At peak flowering in 2020, a search of rehabilitated lands outside of translocation plots failed to locate any orchids, discounting the unlikely possibility that orchid tubers may have survived the process of topsoil stockpiling and respreading. Successful recruitment of Painted Diuris into mining rehabilitation has the potential to significantly offset any losses of this species resulting from mining operations within the region.

AB  - Genome annotation plays a crucial role in providing comprehensive catalog of genes and transcripts for a particular species. As research projects generate new transcriptome data worldwide, integrating this information into existing annotations becomes essential. However, most bioinformatics pipelines are limited in their ability to effectively and consistently update annotations using new RNA-seq data. Here we introduce TAGADA, an RNA-seq pipeline for Transcripts And Genes Assembly, Deconvolution, and Analysis. Given a genomic sequence, a reference annotation and RNA-seq reads, TAGADA enhances existing gene models by generating an improved annotation. It also computes expression values for both the reference and novel annotation, identifies long non-coding transcripts (lncRNAs), and provides a comprehensive quality control report. Developed using Nextflow DSL2, TAGADA offers user-friendly functionalities and ensures reproducibility across different computing platforms through its containerized environment. In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of TAGADA using RNA-seq data from the GENE-SWiTCH project alongside chicken and pig genome annotations as references. Results indicate that TAGADA can substantially increase the number of annotated transcripts by approximately $300\%$ in these species. Furthermore, we illustrate how TAGADA can integrate Illumina NovaSeq short reads with PacBio Iso-Seq long reads, showcasing its versatility. TAGADA is available

AB  - Even in the recent past, kulans (Equus hemionus Pallas, 1775) lived in the Eurasian steppes and deserts, from the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea to China. On the territory of Russia, the kulan was last encountered in 1926 in the Torey Lakes region, and in recent years the question has been raised about the possibility of reintroducing these animals into the Daursky Reserve. This review provides information on the current state of the Mongolian and Turkmenian kulan populations living in the countries of Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Mongolia and China) bordering Russia. Currently, in countries adjacent to Russia, autochthonous populations of the kulan have been preserved in the southern regions of Mongolia and adjacent parts of northern China, where the Mongolian kulan lives (E.h. hemionus Pallas, 1775). The largest population lives in Mongolia, where currently, according to experts, approximately 70 000 individuals are found (or 83% of the world population of the species). Almost half of the kulan's range in Mongolia (42%) is located in nationally protected areas, but the size of existing protected areas, where kulans spend only about 23% of their time, is not large enough for the animals to be fully protected. The expansion of the network of protected areas to 30% of the country's territory by 2030 suggests that the kulan, like other migratory ungulate species of the arid zone, have good prospects. About 80% (or just over 3000 individuals) of the kulan population in China currently lives in the Kalamaili National Nature Reserve in Xinjiang, making this protected area extremely important for the conservation of the species. In the 1930s, the kulans disappeared from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. In Turkmenistan the aboriginal population of the Turkmenian kulan was preserved until the end of the 1990s (E.h. kulan Groves and Mazak, 1967) in the Badkhyz Nature Reserve, but was most likely lost in recent years. A successful program for the reintroduction of kulans, which begun in the 1950s, and since the 1980s took on a larger scale, made it possible to preserve these animals (mainly in protected natural areas) within their historical range. In 2023, just over 30 kulan individuals lived in Turkmenistan in two areas with a total area of 800 km2: in the Tersakan river valley west of the borders of the Syunt Hasardag State Nature Reserve and on the territory of the Kaplankyr State Nature Reserve in the border zone. According to experts, it is very likely that in the near future the species will completely disappear from the country, since none of the indicated groups can be considered viable. The number of kulans living in the territory of the Saigachiy and Sudochye sanctuaries, as well as the Southern Ustyurt National Park in Uzbekistan, is currently estimated at 170 animals. Kulans are also actively breeding in the Jeyran eco-center. The reintroduction of kulans in Kazakhstan is progressing successfully in six protected areas; in 2022-2023 there were about 4400 kulans, and this work continues. From the presented review of the current state of the kulan living on the territory of the Central Asian states, it follows that great attention has been and is being given to the restoration and protection of the species throughout its range.
   This includes providing animals with suitable living conditions, including organizing a network of watering places, removing obstacles in the form of linear structures that interfere with animal migration, regulating the number of livestock, forming a network of protected areas at various levels, including the species in the Red Data Books and adopting legislation on liability for its illegal extraction, as well as creation of centers for breeding and keeping kulans for their subsequent reintroduction and conducting joint long-term and systematic research, including monitoring of populations.

AB  - Progenitor cells are critical in preserving organismal homeostasis, yet their diversity and dynamics in the aged brain remain underexplored. We introduced TrackerSci, a single-cell genomic method that combines newborn cell labeling and combinatorial indexing to characterize the transcriptome and chromatin landscape of proliferating progenitor cells in vivo. Using TrackerSci, we investigated the dynamics of newborn cells in mouse brains across various ages and in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Our dataset revealed diverse progenitor cell types in the brain and their epigenetic signatures. We further quantified aging-associated shifts in cell-type-specific proliferation and differentiation and deciphered the associated molecular programs. Extending our study to the progenitor cells in the aged human brain, we identified conserved genetic signatures across species and pinpointed region-specific cellular dynamics, such as the reduced oligodendrogenesis in the cerebellum. We anticipate that TrackerSci will be broadly applicable to unveil cell-type specific temporal dynamics in diverse systems.

AB  - Introduction Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is characterized by age-dependent amyloid beta (Ab) aggregation and accumulation, neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits. Significantly, there are prominent sex differences in the risk, onset, progression, and severity of AD, as well as response to therapies, with disease burden disproportionately affecting women. Although menopause onset (i.e., perimenopause) may be a critical transition stage for AD susceptibility in women, the role of early ovarian decline in initial disease pathology, particularly key neuroinflammatory processes, is not well understood.Methods To study this, we developed a unique mouse model of perimenopausal AD by combining an accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) model of menopause induced by 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) with the 5xFAD transgenic AD mouse model. To target early stages of disease progression, 5xFAD females were studied at a young age (similar to 4 months) and at the beginning stage of ovarian failure analogous to human perimenopause (termed "peri-AOF"), and compared to age-matched males. Assessment of neuropathology was performed by immunohistochemical labeling of Ab as well as markers of astrocyte and microglia activity in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in learning and memory that is deleteriously impacted during AD.Results Our results show that genotype, AOF, and sex contributed to AD-like pathology. Aggregation of Ab was heightened in female 5xFAD mice and further increased at peri-AOF, with hippocampal subregion specificity. Further, select increases in glial activation also paralleled Ab pathology in distinct hippocampal subregions. However, cognitive function was not affected by peri-AOF.Discussion These findings align with the hypothesis that perimenopause constitutes a period of susceptibility for AD pathogenesis in women.

AB  - Simple Summary This study reports an investigation into 19 French farrow-to-finish farms that successfully implemented the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus type 1 (PRRSV-1) stabilization protocol between 2007 and 2019. One year before (P1) and one year after (P2) the introduction of this protocol, the antibiotic consumptions (expressed in mg/PCU and ALEA) were compared for each farm. The difference between P1 and P2 was also calculated in percentages. The transition from P1 to P2 revealed that the higher the consumption levels were in P1, the greater the antibiotic reduction in P2. These results emphasize how stability against PRRSV-1 seems to reduce antibiotic usage, particularly in farms with a high level of consumption. Infection with the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus type 1 (PRRSV-1) has serious economic consequences for the pig industry. Swine practitioners and other agricultural advisors often describe an increase in antibiotic use when PRRSV-1 is circulating. Our objective was to assess the impact of PRRSV-1 stabilization programs on reducing antibiotic use in 19 French farrow-to-finish farms that successfully implemented such a protocol between 2007 and 2019. For each farm, we compared the global antibiotic consumption, including all physiological stages (expressed in mg/PCU and ALEA) one year before (P1) and one year after (P2) the implementation of the protocol, and the change between P1 and P2 was calculated in percentages. The data were also analyzed by level of consumption. We showed that antibiotic use decreased significantly between P1 and P2 if expressed in mg/PCU and showed a decreased tendency in terms of exposure (ALEA) after PRRSV-1 stabilization. Concerning the change from P1 to P2, depending on the level of consumption in P1, our results showed that the higher the consumption levels were in P1, the greater the antibiotic reduction in P2. This study highlights the ability of a stabilization protocol against PRRSV-1 to reduce antibiotic use, especially on farms that have high consumption rates. These hopeful results show that further investigations about the relationship between PRRSV-1 and antibiotic usage could be beneficial.

AB  - Inspired by animal navigation strategies, we introduce a novel computational model to navigate and map a space rooted in biologically inspired principles. Animals exhibit extraordinary navigation prowess, harnessing memory, imagination, and strategic decision-making to traverse complex and aliased environments adeptly. Our model aims to replicate these capabilities by incorporating a dynamically expanding cognitive map over predicted poses within an active inference framework, enhancing our agent's generative model plasticity to novelty and environmental changes. Through structure learning and active inference navigation, our model demonstrates efficient exploration and exploitation, dynamically expanding its model capacity in response to anticipated novel un-visited locations and updating the map given new evidence contradicting previous beliefs. Comparative analyses in mini-grid environments with the clone-structured cognitive graph model (CSCG), which shares similar objectives, highlight our model's ability to rapidly learn environmental structures within a single episode, with minimal navigation overlap. Our model achieves this without prior knowledge of observation and world dimensions, underscoring its robustness and efficacy in navigating intricate environments.

AB  - Gelatin, widely employed in hydrogel dressings, faces limitations when used in high fluid environments, hindering effective material adhesion to wound sites and subsequently reducing treatment efficacy. The rapid degradation of conventional hydrogels often results in breakdown before complete wound healing. Thus, there is a pressing need for the development of durable adhesive wound dressings. In this study, 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) was utilized as a coupling agent to create gelatin-silica hybrid (G-H) dressings through the sol-gel method. The coupling reaction established covalent bonds between gelatin and silica networks, enhancing structural stability. Dopamine (DP) was introduced to this hybrid (G-H-D) dressing to further boost adhesiveness. The efficacy of the dressings for wound management was assessed through in-vitro and in-vivo tests, along with ex-vivo bioadhesion testing on pig skin. Tensile bioadhesion tests demonstrated that the G-H-D material exhibited approximately 2.5 times greater adhesion to soft tissue in wet conditions compared to pure gelatin. Moreover, invitro and in-vivo wound healing experiments revealed a significant increase in wound healing rates. Consequently, this material shows promise as a viable option for use as a moist wound dressing.

AB  - Introduction China's Hunan Province, known for its extensive lake and marshland areas, continues to face considerable challenges in eliminating schistosomiasis. This study aims to examine the epidemiological characteristics of schistosomiasis in the province, focusing on seropositive rates across various demographic groups, spatial distribution, and identifying key associated factors to inform targeted control measures. Methods From 2020 to 2022, the number of people screened each year using the indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) was 1,053,973, 682,921, and 729,782, respectively. The Cochran-Armitage test for trend and chi-square test were employed to assess differences in seropositive rates among different times, age groups, genders, educational levels, and occupations. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted to identify clusters of seropositive rates at the village level. A multiple logistic model was used to identify associated factors and generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to obtain the parameter estimates. Results From 2020 to 2022, the seropositive rate of schistosomiasis in Hunan Province were 1.53% (95% CI: 1.51-1.55), 2.22% (95% CI: 2.19-2.26), and 2.06% (95% CI: 2.03-2.10), respectively. The seropositive rate in Hunan Province was spatially clustered in each year, with high-high clustering areas mainly distributed around the southern Dongting Lake region, the tributary areas of Dongting Lake, as well as along the Yangtze River. The seropositive rate increased with age, with individuals aged 60-69 showing the highest seropositive rate (adjusted odds ratio [OR] when compared to < 10 years old: 47.94; 95% CI: 30.04-76.52). Males had higher seropositive rate compared to females (adjusted OR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.69-1.76). Compared to farmers, fishermen (adjusted OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 2.40-2.70) and business/service staff (adjusted OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.52-1.74) had higher seropositive rate. The seropositive rate decreased with increasing educational level. Individuals using tap water and sanitary toilets had lower seropositive rate compared to those who did not use (tap water: adjusted OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.64-0.68; sanitary toilets: adjusted OR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93-0.97). Additionally, those who raised sheep had a higher seropositive rate compared to those who did not (adjusted OR: 4.67; 95% CI: 4.04-5.39). Conclusions Schistosomiasis remains a significant public health issue in Hunan Province, with the seropositive rate remaining clustered in certain regions and high-risk populations. Achieving schistosomiasis elimination requires sustained targeted interventions, improved sanitation infrastructure, enhanced health education, and long-term monitoring and comprehensive control measures for high-risk areas and vulnerable populations to reduce transmission risk and ensure sustainable disease elimination.

AB  - Introduction: Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising approach in healthcare, outperforming traditional statistical techniques. However, to establish ML as a reliable tool in clinical practice, adherence to best practices in data handling, and modeling design and assessment is crucial. In this work, we summarize and strictly adhere to such practices to ensure reproducible and reliable ML. Specifically, we focus on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection, a challenging problem in healthcare. Additionally, we investigate the impact of modeling choices, including different data augmentation techniques and model complexity, on overall performance. Methods: We utilize Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from the ADNI corpus to address a binary classification problem using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Data processing and modeling are specifically tailored to address data scarcity and minimize computational overhead. Within this framework, we train 15 predictive models, considering three different data augmentation strategies and five distinct 3D CNN architectures with varying convolutional layers counts. The augmentation strategies involve affine transformations, such as zoom, shift, and rotation, applied either concurrently or separately. Results: The combined effect of data augmentation and model complexity results in up to 10% variation in prediction accuracy. Notably, when affine transformation are applied separately, the model achieves higher accuracy, regardless the chosen architecture. Across all strategies, the model accuracy exhibits a concave behavior as the number of convolutional layers increases, peaking at an intermediate value. The best model reaches excellent performance both on the internal and additional external testing set. Discussions: Our work underscores the critical importance of adhering to rigorous experimental practices in the field of ML applied to healthcare. The results clearly demonstrate how data augmentation and model depth-often overlooked factors- can dramatically impact final performance if not thoroughly investigated. This highlights both the necessity of exploring neglected modeling aspects and the need to comprehensively report all modeling choices to ensure reproducibility and facilitate meaningful comparisons across studies.

AB  - The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), is one of the most damaging pests to coconut palms causing severe economic harm. Its expansion from Asia to the Pacific in the early 20th century has been stopped by virus control. However, a new haplotype CRB-Guam has recently escaped this control and invaded Guam, other Pacific islands, and has even established itself in the Western Hemisphere. In this paper, we present a compartmental ODE model of CRB population and control. We carefully consider CRB life stages and its interplay with coconut palms as well as "the green waste", the organic matters used by CRB for breeding sites. We calibrate and validate the model based on data count of CRBs trapped in Guam between 2008 and 2014. We derive the basic reproduction number determining the CRB population growth without any control measures. We also identify control levels required to eliminate CRBs. We show that, in the absence of viable virus control, the sanitation, i.e., the removal of the green waste is the most efficient way to control the population. Our model predicts that the sanitation efforts need to roughly double from the current levels to eliminate CRB from Guam. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a rare event like Typhoon Dolphin that hit Guam in 2015 can lead to a quick rise of the CRB population.

AB  - Multi-objective Urban Green Space (UGS) design is essential for optimizing limited resources amid diverse urban development challenges. This study introduces a new design support tool that overcomes the data- intensive and expert-reliant limitations faced by urban designers. The tool integrates stormwater management analysis within the Rhinoceros + Grasshopper platform, offering three key features: (1) quantifying stormwater volume in the 3D model, (2) estimating the space required for stormwater management in UGS, and (3) providing options for stormwater management facilities for UGS design. Across the five scenarios, the tool effectively demonstrated (1) the identification that dispersed UGS layouts collect more stormwater than aggregated ones with the same total area; (2) the consideration of the impact of weather changes on passive stormwater collection; and (3) the provision of recommendations on facility areas and locations to enhance collaborative urban and landscape design, better addressing stormwater management needs. This design support tool empowers urban designers to create more sustainable and resilient urban landscapes by addressing stormwater management challenges effectively in UGS design.

AB  - Arsenic-containing hydrocarbons (AsHCs) are typical arsenolipids found in various marine organisms. They can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, specifically affecting synaptic plasticity and the learning and memory ability of hippocampal neurons. Temporal lobe epilepsy often occurs in the hippocampus. Thus, the possible influence of AsHCs exposure to temporal lobe epilepsy garnered attention. The present study investigated the effects of epileptiform discharges (EDs) signals introduced by low-magnesium ACSF in the hippocampus of infantile male rats in vitro, using electrophysiological techniques with multi-electrode arrays under AsHC 360 exposure. In our study of the effects of AsHC 360 on EDs signals, we found that inter-ictal discharges (IIDs) were not significantly impacted. When AsHC 360 was removed, any minor effects observed were reversed. However, when we examined the impact of AsHC 360 on ictal discharges (IDs), distinct patterns emerged based on the concentration levels. For low-concentration groups (5, 20, 60 mu g As L-1), both the frequency and duration effects on IDs returned to normal post-elimination of AsHC 360. However, this recovery was not evident for concentrations of 100 mu g As L-1 or higher. IDs were only observed in EDs signals during exposures to AsHC 360 concentrations up to 60 mu g As L-1. In these conditions, ID frequencies significantly enhanced with the increased of AsHC 360 concentration. At high concentrations of AsHC 360 (>= 100 mu g As L-1), the transition from IIDs or pre-ictal discharges (PIDs) to IDs was notably inhibited. Additional study on co-exposure of AsHC 360 (100 mu g As L-1) and agonist (10 nM (S)-(-)-Bay-K-8644) indicated that the regulation of EDs signals under AsHC 360 exposure could be due to directly interference with the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) expression which influences the binding of excitatory glutamate neurotransmitter to AMPAR. The results suggest that EDs activities in the hippocampus of infantile Sprague Dawley rats are concentration-dependent on AsHC 360 exposure. Thus, it provides a basis for the seafood intake with AsHCs for epileptic patients and those with potential seizures.

AB  - Mixed-lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) activates mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in response to cytokines and stress stimuli. MLK3 is important for proliferation, migration, and invasion of different types of human tumor cells. We observed that endogenous MLK3 was localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in immortalized ovarian epithelial (T80) and ovarian can-cer cells, and mutation of arginines 474 and 475 within a putative MLK3 nuclear localization sequence (NLS) resulted in exclusion of MLK3 from the nucleus. The large tumor suppressor (LATS) Ser/Thr kinase regulates cell proliferation, morphol-ogy, apoptosis, and mitotic exit in response to cell-cell contact. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of LATS1 increased nuclear, endogenous MLK3 in T80 cells. LATS1 phosphorylated MLK3 on Thr477, which is within the putative NLS, and LATS1 expression enhanced the association between MLK3 and the adapter protein 14-3-3'. Thr477 is essential for MLK3-14-3-3' association and MLK3 retention in the cytoplasm, and a T477A MLK3 mutant had predominantly nuclear localization and significantly increased invasiveness of SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. This study identi-fied a novel link between the MAPK and Hippo/LATS1 signaling pathways. Our results reveal LATS1 as a novel regulator of MLK3 that controls MLK3 nuclear/cyto-plasmic localization and MLK3-dependent ovarian cancer cell invasion.

AB  - Drug-coated balloons (DCBs), serving as a superior alternative to stents, are at the cutting edge of clinical innovations in atherosclerosis management. Nevertheless, the prevalent high flow rates in arterial vascular result in short drug residence times, significantly compromising DCBs' therapeutic effectiveness. Drawing inspiration from the mechanisms of vascular calcification, a rapamycin-loaded calcium phosphate nanoparticle (CaP@Rapa) coating for balloons is pioneered. This coating functions as a potent drug anchor in arteries, facilitating the adhesion of rapamycin to plaques and thereby enhancing the local concentration of the rapamycin. To evaluate its therapeutic efficacy in vivo, the rabbit iliac artery atherosclerosis model is innovatively developed, which authentically mirrors the pathological progression of atherosclerosis in humans. The enhanced localized rapamycin retention, along with its pH-sensitive sustained release characteristics, culminate in substantial reductions in plaque volume, a decrease in intimal hyperplasia, and mitigation of local inflammation in model rabbits. To further substantiate the translational potential of CaP@Rapa balloons, the research on the pig coronary atherosclerosis model is expanded, which yielded results solidifying the clinical promise of CaP@Rapa balloons. In summary, this research not only offers a more effective and reliable alternative to traditional DCB but also paves the way for further clinical trials.
   This paper introduces a novel therapeutic strategy utilizing rapamycin-loaded calcium phosphate (CaP@Rapa) coated balloons for atherosclerosis treatment. The CaP@Rapa coating acts as a potent drug anchor, enhancing the targeted delivery of drug to arterial plaques. Using rabbit and porcine models, it confirms the coating's safety and efficacy, suggesting its potential as an advanced cardiovascular intervention. image

AB  - Background: Torsade de pointes is a potentially lethal polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia that can occur in the setting of long QT syndrome (LQTS). LQTS is multi-hit in nature and multiple factors combine their effects leading to increased arrhythmic risk. While hypokalemia and multiple medications are accounted for in LQTS, the arrhythmogenic role of systemic inflammation is increasingly recognized but often overlooked. We tested the hypothesis that the inflammatory cytokine interleukin(IL)-6 will significantly increase the incidence of arrhythmia when combined with other pro-arrhythmic conditions (hypokalemia and the psychotropic medication, quetiapine).
   Methods: Guinea pigs were injected intraperitoneally with IL-6/soluble IL-6 receptor and QT changes were measured in vivo. Subsequently, hearts were cannulated via Langendorff perfusion for ex vivo optical mapping measurements of action potential duration (APD(90)) and arrhythmia inducibility. Computer simulations (MATLAB) were performed to investigate I-Kr inhibition at varying IL-6 and quetiapine concentrations.
   Results: IL-6 prolonged QTc in vivo guinea pigs from 306.74 +/- 7.19 ms to 332.60 +/- 8.75 ms (n = 8, p =.0021). Optical mapping on isolated hearts demonstrated APD prolongation in IL-6- vs saline groups (3Hz APD(90):179.67 +/- 2.47 ms vs 153.5 +/- 7.86 ms, p =.0357). When hypokalemia was introduced, the APD(90) increased to 195.8 +/- 5.02 ms[IL-6] and 174.57 +/- 10.7 ms[saline] (p =.2797), and when quetiapine was added to hypokalemia to 207.67 +/- 3.03 ms[IL-6] and 191.37 +/- 9.49 ms[saline] (p =.2449). After the addition of hypokalemia +/- quetiapine, arrhythmia was induced in 75% of IL-6-treated hearts (n = 8), while in none of the control hearts (n = 6). Computer simulations demonstrated spontaneous depolarizations at similar to 83% aggregate I-Kr inhibition.
   Conclusions: Our experimental observations strongly suggest that controlling inflammation, specifically IL-6, could be a viable and important route for reducing QT prolongation and arrhythmia incidence in the clinical setting.

Two of these species, B. plicobranchus and S. macrothela, are reported for the first time on G. typus. Only C. furcisetifer and S. macrothela were relatively common, encountered on 31% and 40% of G. typus, respectively. Gnathiids were observed infrequently, encountered on 13% of G. typus, and D. cairae and B. plicobranchus were scarce, encountered on 1% and 2% of G. typus, respectively. Intensity of infection for C. furcisetifer and gnathiids increased with host length. Likelihood of infection varied seasonally for C. furcisetifer, being considerably lower in summer, and regionally for gnathiids, being greatest at Shark Bay. Intensity and likelihood of infection for S. macrothela increased with host length and varied regionally, being greatest at Shark Bay. Conclusion These findings improve our understanding of the downstream impacts for dependent parasites that might arise should populations of G. typus continue to decline.

AB  - Body size is one of the main proxies for understanding the biological aspects of fossil vertebrates. Body masses of five species of Cynognathia were obtained from 3D configurations of cranial and mandibular landmarks from 29 specimens. Equations based on centroid size from the literature of ungulates and calculated from carnivorous mammal database were used. In addition, the maximum size per species was obtained by geometric similarity and compared with estimates based on postcranial elements from recent literature. The values of body mass obtained from the centroid size do not present major discrepancies with those obtained from the postcranium, except in the larger specimens of Massetognathus and Exaeretodon. Geometric similarity is useful as a comparative method and for detecting over- or underestimates. Larger size ranges than previously reported were recorded for each cynognathian species. Among the small species, Andescynodon ranged from 1 to 6.5 kg and Pascualgnathus, 2.5 to 6 kg; medium-sized Massetognathus, 10 to 30 kg; and the large species, Cynognathus ranged 100 to 150 kg and Exaeretodon, 100 to 280 kg. The relationship between diet and body mass observed in extant mammals was used as a comparison to determine the possible ecological niche of cynognathians.

AB  - Intracellular calcium signaling underlies the astroglial control of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contacts (MERCs) are key determinants of calcium dynamics, but their functional impact on astroglial regulation of brain information processing is unexplored. We found that the activation of astrocyte mitochondrial-associated type-1 cannabinoid (mtCB(1)) receptors determines MERC-dependent intracellular calcium signaling and synaptic integration. The stimulation of mtCB(1) receptors promotes calcium transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria through a specific molecular cascade, involving the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). Physiologically, mtCB(1)-dependent mitochondrial calcium uptake determines the dynamics of cytosolic calcium events in astrocytes upon endocannabinoid mobilization. Accordingly, electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices showed that conditional genetic exclusion of mtCB(1) receptors or dominant-negative MCU expression in astrocytes blocks lateral synaptic potentiation, through which astrocytes integrate the activity of distant synapses. Altogether, these data reveal an endocannabinoid link between astroglial MERCs and the regulation of brain network functions.

AB  - A large amount of lignocellulosic waste is generated every day in the world, and their accumulation in the agroecosystems, integration in soil compositions, or incineration for energy production has severe environmental pollution effects. Using enzymes as biocatalysts for the biodegradation of lignocellulosic materials, especially in harsh processing conditions, is a practical step towards green energy and environmental biosafety. Hence, the current study focuses on enzyme computationally screened from camel rumen metagenomics data as specialized microbiota that have the capacity to degrade lignocellulosic-rich and recalcitrant materials. The novel hyperthermostable xylanase named PersiXyn10 with the performance at extreme conditions was proper activity within a broad temperature (30-100 degrees C) and pH range (4.0-11.0) but showed the maximum xylanolytic activity in severe alkaline and temperature conditions, pH 8.0 and temperature 90 degrees C. Also, the enzyme had highly resistant to metals, surfactants, and organic solvents in optimal conditions. The introduced xylanase had unique properties in terms of thermal stability by maintaining over 82% of its activity after 15 days of incubation at 90 degrees C. Considering the crucial role of hyperthermostable xylanases in the paper industry, the PersiXyn10 was subjected to biodegradation of paper pulp. The proper performance of hyperthermostable PersiXyn10 on the paper pulp was confirmed by structural analysis (SEM and FTIR) and produced 31.64 g/L of reducing sugar after 144 h hydrolysis. These results proved the applicability of the hyperthermostable xylanase in biobleaching and saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass for declining the environmental hazards.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues have been commercialized for the management of type 2 diabetes. Recent studies have underscored GLP-1's role as a modulator of alcohol-related behavior. However, the role of the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide on alcohol-withdrawal responses have not been fully elucidated. Liraglutide binds to the G-protein-coupled receptor and activates an adenylyl cyclase and the associated classic growth factor signaling pathway, which acts growth factor-like and neuroprotective properties. The underlying neurobiological mechanisms of liraglutide on alcohol withdrawal remains unknown. This study endeavored to explore the effects of liraglutide on the emotion and memory ability of alcohol-withdrawal mice, and synaptic morphology in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus (HP), and thus affects the relapse-like drinking of alcohol-withdrawal mice. The alcohol-withdrawal group was reintroduced to a 20% v/v alcohol and water through the two-bottle choice for four consecutive days, a period referred to as alcohol re-drinking. Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to a regimen of 20% alcohol and water for a duration of 6 weeks. This regimen established the two-bottle choice model of alcohol exposure. Learning capabilities, memory proficiency, and anxiety-like behavior were evaluated using the Morris water maze, open field, and elevated plus maze paradigms. Furthermore, synaptic morphology and the levels of synaptic transport-related proteins were assessed via Golgi staining and Western Blot analysis after a two-week alcohol deprivation period. Alcohol re-drinking of alcohol-withdrawal mice was also evaluated using a two-bottle choice paradigm. Our findings indicate that liraglutide can substantially decrease alcohol consumption and preference (p < 0.05) in the alcohol group and enhance learning and memory performance (p < 0.01), as well as alleviate anxiety-like behavior (p < 0.01) of alcohol-withdrawal mice. Alcohol consumption led to a reduction in dendritic spine density in the mPFC and HP, which was restored to normal levels by liraglutide (p < 0.001). Furthermore, liraglutide was found to augment the levels of synaptic transport-related proteins in mice subjected to alcohol withdrawal (p < 0.01). The study findings corroborate that liraglutide has the potential to mitigate alcohol consumption and ameliorate the memory impairments and anxiety induced by alcohol withdrawal. The therapeutic efficacy of liraglutide might be attributed to its role in counteracting synapse loss in the mPFC and HP regions and thus prevented relapse-like drinking in alcohol-withdrawal mice.

AB  - This study presents for the first time an analysis of the content and chemical composition of the cuticular waxes and cutin in the leaves of the widespread and important tropical species Terminalia catappa. The leaves were collected in the equatorial Atlantic islands of Sao Tome and Principe, in the Gulf of Guinea. The epicuticular and intracuticular waxes were determined via dichloromethane extraction and their chemical composition via GC-MS analysis, and the content and monomeric composition of cutin were determined after depolymerization via methanolysis. The leaves contained an epidermal cuticular coverage of 52.8 mu g cm(-2) of the cuticular waxes (1.4% of mass) and 63.3 mu g cm(-2) (1.5% of mass) of cutin. Cuticular waxes include mainly n-alkanols and fatty acids, with a substantial proportion of terpenes in the more easily solubilized fraction, and sterols in the more embedded waxes. Cutin is mostly constituted by C16 fatty acids and dihydroxyacids, also including aromatic monomers, suggesting a largely linear macromolecular arrangement. The high proportion of triacontanol, alpha-amyrin, beta-amyrin, germanicol, and lupeol in the easily solubilized cuticular fraction may explain the bioactive properties attributed to the T. catappa leaves via the popular medicine, which allows us to consider them as a potential source for the extraction of these compounds.

AB  - Na,K-ATPase is an electrogenic pump found in cell plasma membranes that acts as the basic unit of animal life. This enzyme is highly susceptible to cardiotonic steroid (CTS) inhibition. The role of Na,K-ATPase in signaling has introduced a novel viewpoint regarding the enzyme's function, as the ouabain-binding site is involved in several physiological processes. At high concentrations, ouabain blocks Na+ and K+ ion transport by Na,K-ATPase, whereas at low concentrations, it activates the signaling function of the enzyme. Notably, Na,K-ATPase does not fit into the categories of G protein-coupled receptors or ligand-gated ion channels. This indicates that it may be a distinct cell surface receptor that interacts with signaling molecules through allosteric regulation. In the present study, we have identified new modulators of Na,K-ATPase sensitivity to ouabain, and studied the kinetic effects of physiological concentrations of ouabain on Na,K-ATPase in the hippocampus. Specifically, Cytochrome c (Cytc) increases an affinity for ouabain and the maximal velocity (Vmax) of the enzyme. After binding to Na,K-ATPase, ouabain induces conformational changes that drive shifts between enzymatic cycles.

AB  - The second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) window is advantageous for bioimaging due to its deep tissue penetration and low autofluorescence. Despite these benefits, creating highly sensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoprobes in this range is challenging. This study introduces an ultra-sensitive SERS nanoprobe developed using plasmonic engineering. We selected the commercial Raman dye IR1061, with an absorption peak at 1061 nm, and synthesized gold nanotriangles (AuNTs) to absorb visible light and transfer energy to NIR-II phonons. The combination of IR1061 and AuNTs significantly improved the nanoprobe's sensitivity to 116 fM in the NIR-II window, due to enhanced electromagnetic fields and SERS effects. Theoretical analysis shows AuNTs have stronger electromagnetic hotspots than gold nanorods, enhancing SERS sensitivity. The nanoprobe penetrates pig tissue over 4 mm and agarose gels up to 5 cm. This work presents a novel approach to ultra-sensitive NIR-II SERS nanoprobes for bioimaging and diagnostics. It can not only overcome the bottleneck of traditional imaging technology, but also provide strong support for high-resolution imaging of deep tissues and provide more accurate information for clinical diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Introduction: Nowadays, using electromagnetic devices (EMD) has been increased. However, the control of EMD hazards was poorly evaluated, especially those affected the hippocampus. Regular physical exercises are safe, easily, inexpensive, and acceptable for long-term use. It is reported that exercise protects against many health problems.Aim: is to investigate the hypothesis of the possible prophylactic effect of exercise on the hippocampal damage induced by electromagnetic waves of Wi-Fi.Material and methods: Adult male albino rats were divided into four groups: group I (control), group II (exercise), group III (Wi-Fi), and group IV (exercise -Wi-Fi). Hippocampi were subjected to biochemical, histological, and immunohistochemical techniques.Results: In group III, a significant increase in the oxidative enzymes as well as decrease in antioxidant enzymes were detected in rat hippocampus. Additionally, the hippocampus showed degenerated pyramidal and granular neurons. An evident decrease in both PCNA and ZO-1 immunoreactivity was also noticed. In group IV, physical exercise alleviates the effect of Wi-Fi on previously mentioned parameters.Conclusion: Regular physical exercise performance significantly minimizes the hippocampal damage and protects against the hazarders of chronic Wi-Fi radiation exposure.

AB  - -We studied the mutual influence of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MMSC) isolated from human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly and primary culture of hippocampal cell from transgenic (Tg) 5XFAD mice, a model of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). Antibodies to human nuclear antigen were used to identify MMSCs in "chimeric culture"; the cells belonging to neurons or astrocytes were determined by the presence of positive immunoreactivity to marker proteins MAP2 and GFAP. It was shown that the result of the interaction depends on both the cocultivation method and the age of the culture. In indirect (non-contact) cocultivation, the aggressive environment of the transgenic culture affected the survival rate and impaired the adhesive properties of the MMSCs. Pretreatment of these cells with stress proteins YB-1 and HSP70, which possess neuroprotective properties, increased the resistance of MMSCs. In young culture during contact cocultivation, the MMSCs play the role of specific strands that promote grouping of hippocampal cells of transgenic mice and formation of neurospheres. In old transgenic cultures, irrespective of the cocultivation method, the MMSCs differentiated into astrocytes, but during prolonged direct cocultivation, a part of MMSCs became immunopositive to the neuronal marker MAP2. The work shows that the interaction between the MMSCs and the hippocampal cell culture can be carried out with the participation of gap junctions as well as due to the formation of nanotubes. The results obtained indicate the presence of a complex relationship between donor MMSCs and recipient cells, which must be taken into account when introducing cell therapy into the practice of treating AD patients.

AB  - Background: Political, social, economic, and health system determinants play an important role in creating an enabling environment for maternal and newborn health. This study assesses changes in health systems and policy indicators for maternal and newborn health across 78 low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) during 2008-2018, and examines contextual factors associated with policy adoption and systems changes.Methods: We compiled historical data from WHO, ILO, and UNICEF surveys and databases to track changes in ten maternal and newborn health systems and policy indicators prioritized for tracking by global partnerships. Lo-gistic regression was used to examine the odds of systems and policy change based on indicators of economic growth, gender equality, and country governance with available data from 2008 to 2018.Results: From 2008 to 2018, many LMICs (44/76; 57.9%) substantially strengthened systems and policies for maternal and newborn health. The most frequently adopted policies were national guidelines for kangaroo mother care, national guidelines for use of antenatal corticosteroids, national policies for maternal death noti-fication and review, and the introduction of priority medicines in Essential Medicines Lists. The odds of policy adoption and systems investments were significantly greater in countries that experienced economic growth, had strong female labor participation, and had strong country governance (all p < 0.05).Conclusions: The widespread adoption of priority policies over the past decade is a notable step in creating an environment supportive for maternal and newborn health, but continued leadership and resources are needed to ensure robust implementation that translates into improved health outcomes.

AB  - The TEAD (Sd in drosophila) transcription factors are essential for the Hippo pathway. Human VGLL4 and drosophila Tgi bind to TEAD/Sd via two distinct binding sites. These two regions are separated by few amino acids in VGLL4 but they are very distant from each other in Tgi. This difference prompted us to study whether it influences the interaction with TEAD4/Sd. We show that the full-length VGLL4/Tgi proteins behave as intrinsically disordered proteins. They have a similar affinity for TEAD4/Sd revealing that the length of the region between the two binding sites has little effect on the interaction. One of their two binding sites (high-affinity site) binds to TEAD4/Sd 100 times more tightly than to the other site, and size exclusion chromatography experiments reveal that VGLL4/Tgi only form trimeric complexes with TEAD4/Sd at high protein concentrations. In solution, therefore, VGLL4/Tgi may predominantly interact with TEAD4/Sd via their high-affinity site to create dimeric complexes. In contrast, when TEAD4/Sd molecules are immobilized on sensor chips used in Surface Plasmon Resonance experiments, one VGLL4/Tgi molecule can bind simultaneously with an enhanced affinity to two immobilized molecules. This effect, due to a local increase in protein concentration triggered by the proximity of the immobilized TEAD4/Sd molecules, suggests that in vivo VGLL4/Tgi could bind with an enhanced affinity to two nearby TEAD/Sd molecules bound to DNA. The presence of two binding sites in VGLL4/Tgi might only be required for the function of these proteins when they interact with TEAD/Sd bound to DNA.

AB  - Introduction:Neurotoxicity resulting from air pollution is of increasing concern. Considering exposure timing effects on neurodevelopmental impairments may be as important as the exposure dose. We used distributed lag regression to determine the sensitive windows of prenatal exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on children's cognition in a birth cohort in Mexico.Methods:Analysis included 553 full-term (>= 37 weeks gestation) children. Prenatal daily PM2.5 exposure was estimated using a validated satellite-based spatiotemporal model. McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA) were used to assess children's cognitive function at 4-5 years old (lower scores indicate poorer performance). To identify susceptibility windows, we used Bayesian distributed lag interaction models to examine associations between prenatal PM2.5 levels and MSCA. This allowed us to estimate vulnerable windows while testing for effect modification.Results:After adjusting for maternal age, socioeconomic status, child age, and sex, Bayesian distributed lag interaction models showed significant associations between increased PM2.5 levels and decreased general cognitive index scores at 31-35 gestation weeks, decreased quantitative scale scores at 30-36 weeks, decreased motor scale scores at 30-36 weeks, and decreased verbal scale scores at 37-38 weeks. Estimated cumulative effects (CE) of PM2.5 across pregnancy showed significant associations with general cognitive index (CE<^> = -0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.68, -0.01), quantitative scale (CE<^> = -0.27, 95% CI = -0.74, -0.02), motor scale (CE<^> = -0.25, 95% CI = -0.44, -0.05), and verbal scale (CE<^> = -0.2, 95% CI = -0.43, -0.02). No significant sex interactions were observed.Conclusions:Prenatal exposure to PM2.5, particularly late pregnancy, was inversely associated with subscales of MSCA. Using data-driven methods to identify sensitive window may provide insight into the mechanisms of neurodevelopmental impairment due to pollution.

AB  - Myotragus balearicus is the terminal species of a Caprinae lineage that inhabited the Balearic Islands since the Messinian. Myotragus balearicus had a relatively small brain, reported to be half the size of a contemporary bovid of similar size. This study presents a reassessment of its brain size and anatomy. We demonstrate that the brain of M. balearicus is only 17% smaller when compared to Late Miocene taxa. Since the ancestors of M. balearicus were isolated on the Balearics in the Late Miocene, we deduce that the small brain size of M. balearicus is a feature largely retained from its continental ancestor and only partially the result of geographic isolation. The reduction in brain size can be attributed to reduction of the occipital region. We hypothesise that neuroanatomical changes during the evolutionary process of dwarfism were likely influenced by the absence of ecologically relevant predators.

AB  - Simple Summary Chlamydia abortus causes intracellular persistent infections in sheep, requiring a strong immune response for resolution. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) plays a dual role by modulating the inflammatory immune response during infection and preventing damage during pregnancy. This study used transgenic mice overexpressing IL-10 to model chronic C. abortus infections. The goal was to test the effectiveness of an experimental vaccine and understand the immune mechanisms involved when high levels of IL-10 are present. Both transgenic and control mice were vaccinated and exposed to the bacteria. Results showed that vaccinated control mice cleared the infection by day 9, while transgenic mice still had bacteria at day 28. Vaccination increased a key immune response, with IFN-gamma and iNOS production, but did not change IL-10 levels in transgenic mice. Additionally, fewer immune cells were recruited in vaccinated transgenic mice. The study concludes that vaccine effectiveness is reduced in presence of high IL-10 levels. This model could be used for the development of better vaccines against C. abortus, and could help to test vaccines requiring strong cellular immune responses, thereby benefiting animal health. In ovine populations, the enzootic nature of Chlamydia abortus (C. abortus) is attributed to its capacity to establish persistent intracellular infections, which necessitate a cellular immune response mediated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) for effective resolution. In both natural hosts and murine models, interleukin-10 (IL-10) has been demonstrated to modulate the cellular immune response crucial for the eradication of C. abortus. During gestation, it has also been shown to play a role in preventing inflammatory damage to gestational tissues and foetal loss through the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This paradigm can be key for events leading to a protective response towards an infectious abortion. Previous research successfully established a mouse model of chronic C. abortus infection using transgenic mice overexpressing IL-10 (IL-10tg), simulating the dynamics of chronic infection observed in non-pregnant natural host. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an experimental inactivated vaccine against C. abortus and to elucidate the immune mechanisms involved in protection during chronic infection using this model. Transgenic and wild-type (WT) control mice were immunized and subsequently challenged with C. abortus. Vaccine effectiveness and immune response were assessed via immunohistochemistry and cytokine serum levels over a 28-day period. Morbidity, measured by daily weight loss, was more pronounced in non-vaccinated transgenic IL-10 mice, though no mortality was observed in any group. Vaccinated control mice eliminated the bacterial infection by day 9 post-infection (p.i.), whereas presence of bacteria was noted in vaccinated transgenic IL-10 mice until day 28 p.i. Vaccination induced an early post-infection increase in IFN-gamma production, but did not alter IL-10 production in transgenic mice. Histological analysis indicated suboptimal recruitment of inflammatory cells in vaccinated transgenic IL-10 mice compared to WT controls. In summary, the findings suggest that IL-10 overexpression in transgenic mice diminishes the protective efficacy of vaccination, confirming that this model can be useful for validating the efficacy of vaccines against intracellular pathogens such as C. abortus that require robust cell-mediated immunity.

This paper introduces a novel CDHM inspired by the trunk of elephants, which changes the arm structure from cylindrical to conical. This alteration diminishes the arm's self-weight, reduces the moment arm of gravity, decreases the volume of the end joint, narrows the stroke of the driving cables, and boosts the maximum joint speed of the manipulator. Additionally, this study examines the impact of the manipulator's taper on its overall performance from both dynamic and kinematic perspectives. Finally, three prototype manipulators with varying tapers are confirmed, and tests are conducted on each manipulator's motion performance and cable tension. By comparing experimental data, the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and the rationality of the conical structure are confirmed. The results suggest that the proposed new configuration offers certain advantages in terms of cable stroke, joint speed and maximum driving force.

AB  - Mechanotransduction sensing of tissue architecture and cellular microenvironment is a fundamental regulator of cell fate, including cancer. Meanwhile, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play multifunctions during cancer development and treatment. However, the link between lncRNAs and cellular mechanotransduction in the context of cancer progression has not yet been elucidated. In this study, using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we find that ionizing radiation reduces tumor stiffness. Ionizing radiation-induced lncRNA CRYBG3 can blunt YAP/TAZ activity through interference with mechanotransduction, resulting in the inhibition of cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of lung cancer cells. In vivo, we found that loss of lncRNA CRYBG3 could power the tumor initiation and metastasis ability, but this was abolished by concomitant deplete TAZ. At the molecular level, lncRNA CRYBG3 that in turn dysregulates F-actin organization, activates the LATS1/2 kinase, all in all resulting in YAP/TAZ nuclear exclusion. Our research proposes that lncRNA CRYBG3 is a mediator of radiotherapy through its control of cancer-tissue mechanotransduction and wiring YAP/TAZ activity to control tumor growth and metastasis.

AB  - Background: Gastrodia elata (Orchidaceae) is a medicinal plant used in traditional Chinese medicine. The rhizomes contain numerous active components, of which Gastrodin (p-hydroxymethylphenyl-B-D-glucopyranoside) forms the basis of the traditional medicine Gastrodiae Rhizoma. Gastrodin is also found in other medicinal plants and has neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. Neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in neurodegeneration. Research indicates that consuming meals and drinks containing Gastrodiaelata can enhance cognitive functioning and memory in elderly patients. The mechanisms relevant to the problem have not been completely understood.
   Purpose: The aim was to examine the in vivo and in vitro anti-neuroinflammatory effects of Gastrodin. Study design: The neuroprotective effects of Gastrodin on the TLR4/TRAF6/NF-kappa B pathway and Stat3 phosphorylation in LPS-treated C57BL/6 mice and BV-2 cells were investigated.
   Methods: 1. C57BL/6 mice were assigned to model, gastrodin, donepezil, and control groups (n = 10 per group). The Gastrodin group received 100 mg/kg/d for five days, and the Dopenezil group 1.3 mg/kg/d. A neuroinflammation model was established by administering intraperitoneal injections of 2 mg/kg LPS to all groups, excluding the control. To induce microglial activation in Gastrodin-treated mouse microglial BV-2 cells, 1 mu g/ml LPS was introduced for 24 h Morris water mazes were utilized to evaluate learning and spatial memory. Expression and subcellular localization of TLR4/TRAF6/NF-kappa B axis-related proteins and p-Stat3, Iba-1, GFAP, iNOS, and CD206 were assessed by immunofluorescence, western blots, and ELISA. qRT-PCR was performed to determine and measure IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, cell migration, and phagocytosis. Overexpression of TRAF6 was induced by transfection, and the effect of Gastrodin on IL-1 beta and p-NF-kappa B p65 levels was assessed.
   Results: 1. In mice, gastrodin treatment mitigated LPS-induced deficits in learning and spatial memory, as well as reducing neuroinflammation in the hippocampus, expression of TLR4/TRAF6/NF- kappa B pathway proteins, activation of microglia and astrocytes, and phosphorylation of Stat3. 2. Gastrodin pretreatment improved LPS-induced inflammation in vitro, reducing expression of TLR4/TRAF6/NF-kappa B-associated proteins and p-Stat3, inducing microglial transformation from M1 to M2, and inhibiting migration and phagocytosis. Overexpression of TRAF6 inhibited the Gastrodin-induced effects.
   Conclusion: Gastrodin suppresses neuroinflammation and microglial activation by modifying the TLR4/TRAF6/NF-kappa B pathway and Stat3 phosphorylation.

AB  - The transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ) induces cell proliferation through nuclear localization at low cell density. Conversely, at extremely high cell density, the Hippo pathway, which regulates YAP/TAZ, is activated. This activation leads to the translocation of YAP/TAZ into the cytoplasm, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Various cancer cells have several times more YAP/TAZ than normal cells. However, it is not entirely clear whether this several-fold increase in YAP/TAZ alone is sufficient to overcome proliferation inhibition (contact inhibition) under high-density conditions, thereby allowing continuous proliferation. In this study, we construct a three-dimensional (3D) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway. Herein, a significant innovation in our approach is the introduction of a novel modeling component that inputs cell density, which reflects cell dynamics, into the Hippo pathway and enables the simulation of cell proliferation as the output response. We assume such 3D model with cell-cell interactions by solving reaction and molecular dynamics (MD) equations by applying adhesion and repulsive forces that act between cells and frictional forces acting on each cell. We assume Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential with a softcore character so that each cell secures its exclusive domain. We set cell cycles composed of mitotic and cell growth phases in which cells divide and grow under the influence of cell kinetics. We perform mathematical simulations at various YAP/TAZ levels to investigate the extent of YAP/TAZ increase required for sustained proliferation at high density. The results show that a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels of cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest compared to normal cells, enabling cells to continue proliferating even under high-density conditions. Finally, this mathematical model, which incorporates cell-cell interactions and the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway, may be applicable for evaluating cancer malignancy based on YAP/TAZ levels, developing drugs to suppress the abnormal proliferation of cancer cells, and determining appropriate drug dosages.

AB  - The ventral hippocampus (vH) plays a crucial role in anxiety-related behaviour and vH neurons increase their firing when animals explore anxiogenic environments. However, if and how such neuronal activity induces or restricts the exploration of an anxiogenic location remains unexplained. Here, we developed a novel behavioural paradigm to motivate rats to explore an anxiogenic area. Male rats ran along an elevated linear maze with protective sidewalls, which were subsequently removed in parts of the track to introduce an anxiogenic location. We recorded neuronal action potentials during task performance and found that vH neurons exhibited remapping of activity, overrepresenting anxiogenic locations. Direction-dependent firing was homogenised by the anxiogenic experience. We further showed that the activity of vH neurons predicted the extent of exploration of the anxiogenic location. Our data suggest that anxiety-related firing does not solely depend on the exploration of anxiogenic environments, but also on intentions to explore them.

AB  - Introduction: The hippocampus (HPC) supports integration of information across time, often indexed by associative inference (AI) and statistical learning (SL) tasks. In AI, an indirect association between stimuli that never appeared together is inferred, whereas SL involves learning item relationships by extracting regularities across experiences. A recent model of hippocampal function (Schapiro et al., 2017) proposes that the HPC can support temporal integration in both paradigms through its two distinct pathways. Methods: We tested this models' predictions in four patients with varying degrees of bilateral HPC damage and matched healthy controls, with two patients with complementary damage to either the monosynaptic or trisynaptic pathway. During AI, participants studied overlapping paired associates (AB, BC) and their memory was tested for premise pairs (AB) and for inferred pairs (AC). During SL, participants passively viewed a continuous picture sequence that contained an underlying structure of triplets that later had to be recognized. Results: Binomial distributions were used to calculate above chance performance at the individual level. For AI, patients with focal HPC damage were impaired at inference but could correctly infer pairs above chance once premise pair acquisition was equated to controls; however, the patient with HPC and cortical damage showed severe impairment at recalling premise and inferred pairs, regardless of accounting for premise pair performance. For SL, none of the patients performed above chance, but notably neither did most controls. Conclusions: Associative inference of indirect relationships can be intact with HPC damage to either hippocampal pathways or the HPC more broadly, provided premise pairs can first be formed. Inference may remain intact through residual HPC tissue supporting premise pair acquisition, and/or through extra-hippocampal structures supporting inference at retrieval. Clear conclusions about hippocampal contributions to SL are precluded by low performance in controls, which we caution is not dissimilar to previous amnesic studies using the same task. This complicates interpretations of studies claiming necessity of hippocampal contributions to SL and warrants the use of a common and reliable task before conclusions can be drawn.

AB  - High-resolution awake mouse functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) remains challenging despite extensive efforts to address motion-induced artifacts and stress. This study introduces an implantable radio frequency (RF) surface coil design that minimizes image distortion caused by the air/tissue interface of mouse brains while simultaneously serving as a headpost for fixation during scanning. Furthermore, this study provides a thorough acclimation method used to accustom animals to the MRI environment minimizing motion-induced artifacts. Using a 14 T scanner, high-resolution fMRI enabled brain-wide functional mapping of visual and vibrissa stimulation at 100 mu mx100 mu mx200 mu m resolution with a 2 s per frame sampling rate. Besides activated ascending visual and vibrissa pathways, robust blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses were detected in the anterior cingulate cortex upon visual stimulation and spread through the ventral retrosplenial area (VRA) with vibrissa air-puff stimulation, demonstrating higher-order sensory processing in association cortices of awake mice. In particular, the rapid hemodynamic responses in VRA upon vibrissa stimulation showed a strong correlation with the hippocampus, thalamus, and prefrontal cortical areas. Cross-correlation analysis with designated VRA responses revealed early positive BOLD signals at the contralateral barrel cortex (BC) occurring 2 s prior to the air-puff in awake mice with repetitive stimulation, which was not detected using a randomized stimulation paradigm. This early BC activation indicated a learned anticipation through the vibrissa system and association cortices in awake mice under continuous exposure of repetitive air-puff stimulation. This work establishes a high-resolution awake mouse fMRI platform, enabling brain-wide functional mapping of sensory signal processing in higher association cortical areas.

AB  - Introduction: Animal vehicle collisions (AVCs) are a global safety concern, requiring analysis and predictive models for understanding and mitigation. Police crash report data are one of the main sources of AVC data globally. However, they are prone to reporting policy change and other inconsistencies, particularly in rural areas, hindering the development of predictive models. Through development of a robust approach for data cleaning, quality control, feature selection, and contribution level identification, this study proposes a pipeline to address this shortcoming. Method: North Dakota crash data set is used as a case study due to high rates on AVC in this rural region and its diverse wildlife ecosystem. Theil's U association index, and chi-square tests were implemented in the pipeline to evaluate the proposed pipeline effectiveness. The pipeline detects and removes skewed proportion samples, while addressing data collection inconsistency, low variance, and duplicated features. Results: Pipeline imposed 3.5% sample size and 88.9% feature size reduction on the original crash data over 20 years. Observation on the modified dataset revealed year, day, and driver features had the lowest while hour, county, and speed limit had the highest statistical contribution to the AVC. Light, hour, and month were lumped in daily solar cycle and represented as a single temporal feature that can be used effectively to develop predictive model. Finally, presented pipeline increased spatiotemporal integrity while reducing the runtime by 92.46% for the association analysis.

AB  - As an important part of environmental science and water resources management, water quality prediction is of great importance. In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) at the outlet of a reservoir, this paper proposes an improved Seahorse Optimizer to enhance the hybrid kernel extreme learning machine model for water quality prediction. Firstly, the circle chaotic map is used to initialize the hippocampus population to improve the diversity and quality of the population, and then the sine and cosine strategy is used to replace the predation behavior of the hippocampus to improve the global search ability. Finally, the lens imaging reverse learning strategy is used to expand the search range and prevent it from falling into the local optimal solution. By introducing two kernel functions, a global kernel function (Poly) and a local kernel function (RBF), a new hybrid kernel function extreme learning machine is formed by linearly combining these two kernel functions. The parameters of this HKELM are optimized with the improved Seahorse Optimizer, and the water quality prediction model of CZTSHO-HKELM is constructed. The simulation results show that the operating efficiency and prediction accuracy of the model are better than those of the ELM, CZTSHO-ELM, CZTSHO-KELM, and SHO-HKELM models, with the correlation coefficients increased by 5.5%, 3.3%, 3.4%, and 7.4%, respectively. The dissolved oxygen prediction curve is close to the actual dissolved oxygen change, which can better meet the requirements of reservoir water quality prediction. The above method can be applied to further accurately predict the water quality of the reservoir.

AB  - Introduction: Iron is crucial for brain function, but excessive iron is neurotoxic. Abnormally high brain iron accumulation is one of the pathogenic factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, understanding the mechanistic basis of iron dyshomeostasis in AD is vital for disease mitigation. Calcium, another essential bioelement involved in cell signaling, also exhibits dysregulated homeostasis in AD. Calcium ion (Ca2+) signaling can influence iron homeostasis through multiple effectors. Our previous studies identified Ca2+/calmodulin (CAM)-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2) as a regulator of transferrin (TF)-bound iron trafficking through the TF receptor (TFRC). Given CAMKK2's high expression in brain cells, it was hypothesized that abnormal CAMKK2-TF/TFRC signaling may underlie excessive iron deposition in AD brains. This study aims to retrospectively investigate CAMKK2, TF, TFRC proteins, and iron content in temporal cortex tissues from AD patients and cognitively normal (CN) individuals, postmortem. Methods: Postmortem temporal cortex tissues from 74 AD patients, 27 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and 17 CN individuals were analyzed for CAMKK2, TF, and TFRC protein levels by Western blotting. Additionally, prefrontal/temporal cortex tissues from 30 CN individuals of various ages were examined for age-related effects. Iron content in cortical tissues was measured using a colorimetric assay. Results: CAMKK2, TF, and TFRC levels were significantly decreased in AD patients' temporal cortices compared to CN individuals, independent of age or postmortem interval-related changes. PD patients' also exhibited similar reductions in CAMKK2/TF/TFRC levels. The increased iron content in AD brains was significantly correlated with reduced TF/TFRC protein levels. Discussion: Building on the previous identification of CAMKK2 as a regulator of TF/TFRC trafficking and iron homeostasis, the findings from this study suggest that downregulation of CAMKK2 in AD cortices may disrupt TF/TFRC signaling and contribute to iron overloading and neurodegeneration through iron-induced toxicity. The decreased levels of TF/TFRC and increased iron in AD brains may result from enhanced clearance or post-trafficking degradation of TF/TFRC due to CAMKK2 downregulation. Restoring CAMKK2 levels in the AD brain could offer a novel therapeutic approach to reestablish iron homeostasis. Further studies are needed to explore the pathways linking CAMKK2 and iron dysregulation in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Yes-associated protein (YAP) and PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) have emerged as important regulators of pathologic fibroblast activation in fibrotic diseases. Agonism of G alpha s-coupled G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) provides an attractive approach to inhibit the nuclear localization and function of YAP and TAZ in fibroblasts that inhibits or reverses their pathological activation. Agonism of the dopamine D1 GPCR has proven effective in preclinical models of lung and liver fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms coupling GPCR agonism to YAP and TAZ inactivation in fibroblasts remain incompletely understood. Here, using human lung fibroblasts, we identify critical roles for the cAMP effectors EPAC1/2, the small GTPase RAP2c, and the serine/threonine kinase MAP4K7 as the essential elements in the downstream signaling cascade linking GPCR agonism to LATS1/2-mediated YAP and TAZ phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion in fibroblasts. We further show that this EPAC/RAP2c/MAP4K7 signaling cascade is essential to the effects of dopamine D1 receptor agonism on reducing fibroblast proliferation, contraction, and extracellular matrix production. Targeted modulation of this cascade in fibroblasts may prove a useful strategy to regulate YAP and TAZ signaling and fibroblast activities central to tissue repair and fibrosis.

AB  - Background: Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) is the most common (45%-74%) mucormycosis in India. With contemporary medical care, ROCM has a mortality rate of 40%-50% and 70% of survivors are left with residual defects. Recently, several cases of mucormycosis in people with COVID-19 have been increasingly reported worldwide, from India, due to immune dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2. To reduce the high mortality rate and residual defect in most survivors under the guidelines of the Ministry of AYUSH, the Government of India recommended homoeopathy as an add-on therapy to maximizethe effectiveness of standard treatment in conventional therapy. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the role of existing homoeopathic treatment as an adjuvant therapy in patients with COVID-19-related ROCM and enhancing the survival of the patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection and to access the initial treatment response and duration required for significant or complete recovery in patients receiving adjuvant treatment. Methods: Thissuperiority, randomizedcontrolledclinical trial would includetwo parallel comparatorgroupsA and B. Group A would be the experimental group and would receive homoeopathic treatment along with the standard line of treatment as per investigational medicinal product (IMP) and group B would be the control arm and would receive standard line of treatment as per IMP along with identical placebo. Allocation would be 1:1 through randomization. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 36 participants per arm would be screened. Participants would be assessed clinically twice a day and magnetic resonance imagery or endoscopy cum-biopsy would be assessed on days 1, 14, and 28. Laboratory investigations may vary as per demand of disease conditions. Results: In India, the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly during the second wave, resulted in a surge of mucormycosis cases among patients with COVID-19. At the time this protocol was being developed, there was a significant spike in mucormycosis cases in India, particularly in Mumbai (June 2021). However, by the time the Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy obtained the necessary approvals and ethical clearance for the study, the incidence of mucormycosis had drastically declined (September 2021). As a result, the study was not initiated and registered. The authors feel it is their ethical responsibility to share the reviewed protocol with the medical community as a reference for future work. Conclusions:This study aims to evaluate the role of existing homoeopathic medicines as an adjuvant therapy in managing COVID-19-related ROCM, potentially contributing to the use of homoeopathy as an evidence-based medical approach. The protocol can also serve as a valuable resourcefor clinicians and researchers addressing mucormycosis cases unrelated to COVID-19, particularly in immunocompromised patients. It would help ensure preparedness, whether or not sufficient evidence is available, in the event of a future health emergency. International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID): PRR1-10.2196/57905

AB  - Introduction: In a previous retrospective study using postmortem human brain tissues, we demonstrated that loss of Cholinergic Receptor Muscarinic 1 (CHRM1) in the temporal cortex of a subset of Alzheimer's patients was associated with poor survival, whereas similar loss in the hippocampus showed no such association. Mitochondrial dysfunction underlies Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Therefore, to investigate the mechanistic basis of our findings, we evaluated cortical mitochondrial phenotypes in Chrm1 knockout (Chrm1(-/-)) mice. Cortical Chrm1 loss resulted in reduced respiration, reduced supramolecular assembly of respiratory protein complexes, and caused mitochondrial ultrastructural abnormalities. These mouse-based findings mechanistically linked cortical CHRM1 loss with poor survival of Alzheimer's patients. However, evaluation of the effect of Chrm1 loss on mouse hippocampal mitochondrial characteristics is necessary to fully understand our retrospective human tissue-based observations. This is the objective of this study.
   Methods: Enriched hippocampal and cortical mitochondrial fractions (EHMFs/ECMFs, respectively) derived from wild-type and Chrm1(-/-) mice were used to measure respiration by quantifying real-time oxygen consumption, supramolecular assembly of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-associated proteins by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, post-translational modifications (PTMs) by isoelectric focusing (IEF), and mitochondrial ultrastructure by electron microscopy.
   Results: In contrast to our previous observations in Chrm1(-/-) ECMFs, EHMFs of Chrm1(-/-) mice significantly increased respiration with a concomitant increase in the supramolecular assembly of OXPHOS-associated proteins, specifically Atp5a and Uqcrc2, with no mitochondrial ultrastructural alterations. IEF of ECMFs and EHMFs from Chrm1(-/-) mice showed a decrease and an increase, respectively in a negatively charged (pH similar to 3) fraction of Atp5a relative to the wild-type mice, with a corresponding decrease or increase in the supramolecular assembly of Atp5a and respiration indicating a tissue-specific signaling effect.
   Discussion: Our findings indicate that loss of Chrm1 in the cortex causes structural, and physiological alterations to mitochondria that compromise neuronal function, whereas Chrm1 loss in the hippocampus may benefit neuronal function by enhancing mitochondrial function. This brain region-specific differential effect of Chrm1 deletion on mitochondrial function supports our human brain region-based findings and Chrm1(-/-) mouse behavioral phenotypes. Furthermore, our study indicates that Chrm1-mediated brain region-specific differential PTMs of Atp5a may alter complex-V supramolecular assembly which in turn regulates mitochondrial structure-function.

AB  - Introduction: Tick-borne diseases have a significant impact on public and animal health and represent a considerable financial burden on livestock farming. However, in many regions of Latin America, comprehensive epidemiological data, including species identification, geographical distribution and molecular profiling of ticks and their associated pathogens, remain scarce. The aims of the present study were: 1) to establish the distribution of tick species collected from domestic animals and 2) to molecularly characterise the rickettsial bacteria present in ticks from the department of Atl & aacute;ntico, area Caribe, Colombia. Methods: Between January 2021 and March 2022, ticks were collected from 216 cattle and 72 sympatric domestic animals (38 dogs, 31 equids and 3 goats) on 28 farms. Specimens were identified and grouped into 297 pools. Molecular detection and characterisation of the pathogens were carried out by targeting the partial gltA, ompA, ompB and 16S rRNA genes of Rickettsia and the partial 23S rRNA and 16S rRNA genes of Anaplasmataceae. Results: A total of 1541 ticks were collected, and four species belonging to the genera Rhipicephalus, Dermacentor and Amblyomma were identified. A total of 137 out of 288 animals (47.6%) were infested with a mean infection rate of 9.7 +/- SD 6.8 ticks per animal. Rickettsia spp. and Anaplasmataceae DNA were detected in 2.7% (MIR: 0.5%) and 15.5% (MIR: 0.3%) of the tick pools, respectively. The obtained sequences showed high nucleotide identity (99%-100%) with sequences of Candidatus Rickettsia colombiensis, Anaplasma marginale, Anaplasma platys, Ehrlichia canis and Ehrlichia minasensis. Conclusion: Our data represent the first description of Dermacentor nitens and Amblyomma patinoi in the Atlantic region of the Colombian Caribbean. Considering the risk that the tick and rickettsial species represent for public and animal health, monitoring and control programmes are necessary to prevent the spread of tick-borne pathogenic bacteria to humans.

AB  - IntroductionHarmonization of methodological approaches to the analysis of herbal substances containing triterpenoid saponins, considered the largest group of phytochemicals, is essential for the pharmaceutical industry worldwide.ObjectivesThis review aimed to perform a comparative analysis of the requirements for the standardization of herbal substances, herbal medicinal products (HMPs), and other herbal materials containing triterpenoid saponins in the pharmacopeial texts of the Russian Federation and the world's leading pharmacopeias.Materials and MethodsThe review covers the data on the quantitative and qualitative analysis of herbal substances containing triterpenoid saponins, as presented in the State Register of Medicinal Products of Russia and the monographs of the world's leading pharmacopeias: the European Pharmacopeia, United States Pharmacopeia, British Pharmacopeia, Japanese Pharmacopeia, and the national pharmacopeias of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) Member States.ResultsThis review compares and discusses the analytical methods used for the standardization of Aesculus hippocastanum L. seeds, Aralia elata (Miq.) Seem roots, Glycyrrhiza spp. roots, Orthosiphon aristatus (Blume) Miq. leaves, and Polemonium caeruleum L. rhizomes with roots. The most common analytical methods used are (HP)TLC and (U)HPLC. The Russian Pharmacopeia also includes titrimetry and spectrophotometry.ConclusionsThe appropriate selection of a group of biologically active compounds for HMP standardization is still challenging. We believe that a rational approach to the standardization of herbal substances and HMPs should be based on the use of herbal substances with maximum extractability and specific pharmacological activity. The harmonized procedures and reference substances for the identification and assay of active metabolites in HMPs must be implemented at all stages of production control from herbal substances to finished dosage forms.

AB  - Synthetic pheromones have been used for pest control over several decades. The conventional synthesis of di-unsaturated pheromone compounds is usually complex and costly. Camelina (Camelina sativa) has emerged as an ideal, non-food biotech oilseed platform for production of oils with modified fatty acid compositions. We used Camelina as a plant factory to produce mono- and di-unsaturated C-12 chain length moth sex pheromone precursors, (E)-9-dodecenoic acid and (E,E)-8,10-dodecadienoic acid, by introducing a fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase FatB gene UcTE from California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica) and a bifunctional increment 9 desaturase gene Cpo_CPRQ from the codling moth, Cydia pomonella. Different transgene combinations were investigated for increasing pheromone precursor yield. The most productive Camelina line was engineered with a vector that contained one copy of UcTE and the viral suppressor protein encoding P19 transgenes and three copies of Cpo_CPRQ transgene. The T-2 generation of this line produced 9.4% of (E)-9-dodecenoic acid and 5.5% of (E,E)-8,10-dodecadienoic acid of the total fatty acids, and seeds were selected to advance top-performing lines to homozygosity. In the T-4 generation, production levels of (E)-9-dodecenoic acid and (E,E)-8,10-dodecadienoic acid remained stable. The diene acid together with other seed fatty acids were converted into corresponding alcohols, and the bioactivity of the plant-derived codlemone was confirmed by GC-EAD and a flight tunnel assay. Trapping in orchards and home gardens confirmed significant and specific attraction of C. pomonella males to the plant-derived codlemone.

AB  - Introduction: Stress impairs cognitive processes and escitalopram affects them in various ways. The present study has compared the protective effects of two escitalopram doses on neural excitability and synaptic plasticity in the CA1 region of chronically stressed and non-stressed male rats.
   Methods: Forty-nine rats were randomly allocated into seven groups: Control (Co), stress (St), sham (Sh), escitalopram 10 and 20 mg/kg (Esc10 and Esc20), and stress-escitalopram 10 and 20 mg/kg (St-Esc10 and St-Esc20). Induction of restraint stress (6 h/day) and escitalopram injections were performed for 14 days. The fEPSP slope and amplitude were measured according to input-output functions and after the LTP induction in the hippocampal CA1 region. Also, serum corticosterone levels were evaluated in all experimental groups.
   Results: The fEPSP slope and amplitude decreased significantly in the St group and increased significantly in the Esc10 group compared with the Co group. In non-stressed states, significant increases in slope and amplitude occurred in the Esc10 group compared with the Esc20 group. Notably, these values were also significantly enhanced by both escitalopram doses under stressed conditions. Moreover, serum corticosterone levels significantly elevated in the St group although its levels decreased in both St-Esc groups compared with the St.
   Conclusion: Stress significantly attenuated neural excitability and long-term plasticity in the CA1 area. Only escitalopram 10 mg/kg improved synaptic excitability, as well as LTP induction and maintenance in non-stressed subjects even more than normal levels. However, under stress conditions, both escitalopram doses enhanced neural excitability and memory probably due to reduced serum corticosterone levels.

AB  - Designing diversified multi-cropping systems is critical for making full use of natural resources on the limited cultivated land to achieve more agricultural products in a sustainable way. However, information is still lacking on whether the higher multi-cropping index possibly decreases the use efficiency of resources and the sustain-ability of the cropping system due to more agricultural inputs on limited farmland. Therefore, this study introduced the emergy evaluation and designed two trials to quantitatively compare the efficiency and sus-tainability of different multi-cropping systems in South China, where double-rice was used as a control (CK). Trial 1 included peanut-rice (PRF), peanut-rice/ryegrass x milk vetch mixture (1:1) (PRM1), and peanut-rice/ ryegrass x milk vetch mixture (1:2) (PRM2). Trial two included maize-rice (MRF), maize-rice/ryegrass x milk vetch mixture (1:1) (MRM1), and maize-rice/ryegrass x milk vetch mixture (1:2) (MRM2). In trial 1, compared to CK, the annual productivity of PRF decreased 15.38%, while both PRM1 and PRM2 increased 10.49%. Results illustrated that the annual productivity of the MRF, MRM1, and MRM2 systems in trial 2 were improved by 53.85%-85.31% compared to the CK. Meanwhile, the efficiency of the maize-based cultivation patterns (MRF, MRM1, and MRM2) to use nonrenewable resources was increased by 23.56%-24.62% compared to the con-ventional double-rice system. Moreover, the emergy sustainability index (ESI) in MRM1, and MRM2 systems were 175.63% and 175.51% higher than the CK, respectively. The ESI of PRF, PRM1, and PRM2 were 12.13%, 118.20% and 118.05% higher than CK, respectively. In general, the MRM1 and MRM2 showed the highest ef-ficiency and sustainability compared to other cropping patterns. The key points to improve the efficiency and sustainability of multi-cropping systems were to optimize the fertilizer and labor inputs. This study provided valuable information for the development of diversified multi-cropping systems in South China. It was also a reference for the development of sustainable agriculture in the subtropical agricultural system in the world.

AB  - IntroductionNeonatal hypoxia ischemia (HI) causes injury to the blood brain barrier (BBB), which in turn is associated with widespread cell loss. Cell therapies are currently being investigated for use in perinatal neuroprotection and umbilical cord blood (UCB) endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs; CD133+) have been previously shown to reduce gross neuropathology associated with HI; however, no study has investigated the effect of EPC treatment on the vulnerable BBB. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effect of EPC treatment on BBB integrity in a neonatal rat model of HI.MethodsHI brain injury was induced in postnatal day (PND) 7 rat pups via permanent ligation of the left carotid artery, followed by a 180-minute hypoxic challenge at 8% O2. At 24 h post-insult, 2 x 105 EPCs were administered via intraperitoneal injection. At 7 days post-HI, brains and choroid plexuses were collected for immunohistochemistry or molecular analyses.ResultsNeonatal HI resulted in neuropathology, with a significant increase in left hemisphere tissue loss. This was associated with microglial activation, astrogliosis and increased expression of Aquaporin 4 in the somatosensory cortex, and EPC administration significantly reduced these outcomes. Assessment of the BBB revealed GLUT1 and claudin-5 expression were significantly increased in HI animals compared to sham, and treatment with EPCs reduced these to sham control levels.ConclusionEPCs are a promising treatment option for neonatal HI as they modulate BBB changes. However, further studies are needed to understand early effects of EPC treatment and how EPC therapy modulates BBB dysfunction post HI brain injury.

AB  - Simple Summary The current research evaluated the impact of adding dietary fiber to sows during the transitional phase, specifically examining its effects on constipation, the farrowing process, colostrum production, and the mortality of piglets before weaning within a free-farrowing system. Administering 75 g/day of dietary fiber to sows for 7 days before farrowing, especially in those with larger litters, showed a decrease in constipation rates and a reduction in the time taken for farrowing. Additionally, this fiber supplementation resulted in lower mortality rates in piglets prior to weaning. However, this addition of fiber did not improve the production of colostrum and milk, nor did it increase the consumption of colostrum by piglets. These results suggest that in a free-farrowing system, providing sows with dietary fiber during the transitional period can alleviate constipation and shorten the duration of farrowing. Nevertheless, it is advisable to manage the body condition of sows before farrowing to address issues like constipation effectively and to boost colostrum intake. This study investigated how dietary fiber supplementation during the transition period in sows affects constipation, farrowing duration, colostrum production, milk yield, and pre-weaning piglet mortality in the free-farrowing system. A total of 92 Landrace x Yorkshire sows and their 1272 offspring were included in the study. Sows were divided into two groups by parity: control (n = 41) and treatment (n = 51). The control group was fed a standard lactation diet 7 days before farrowing, whereas the treatment group received the same diet with 75 g/day of a dietary fiber supplement. The dietary fiber content analyses were 4.30% and 5.53% in the control and treatment groups, respectively. Sows were fed with 3.89 +/- 0.92 kg per day with a diet containing 17.8% crude protein, 3732 kcal/kg of metabolizable energy, and 1.1% lysine. Parameters including farrowing duration, litter characteristics, and the fecal condition of sows were measured. Piglet mortality rates were recorded at 3, 7, and 21 days of lactation. Sows had an average farrowing duration of 216 +/- 159 min, with litter sizes of 13.8 +/- 4.2 piglets per litter, and a 7.4% stillbirth rate. The treatment group showed a lower constipation rate compared to the control group (17.6% vs. 46.3%, p = 0.003). Farrowing duration did not significantly differ between groups, but the treatment group experienced a 43.6 min shorter duration. In sows with litter sizes of >= 16 piglets per litter, the farrowing duration for sows in the treatment group tended to be shorter than that of the control groups (202.0 +/- 37.9 vs. 287.5 +/- 41.3 min, p = 0.115). The mean colostrum intake of piglets in the control and treatment groups averaged 424.0 +/- 13.7 g and 421.8 +/- 12.6 g, respectively (p = 0.908). Likewise, the milk production of sows from Days 3 to 10 and from Days 10 to 17 of lactation in the treatment group (7.34 +/- 0.27 and 8.76 +/- 0.43 kg/day, respectively) did not differ from that of the control group (7.85 +/- 0.30 and 9.55 +/- 0.47 kg/day, respectively, p > 0.05). Pre-weaning piglet mortality was slightly lower in the treatment group (13.4% vs. 17.3%, p = 0.085). Across groups, piglet mortality rates within 3, 7, and 21 days were 10.3%, 11.9%, and 15.4%, respectively. Piglets with a <= 200 g colostrum intake had a higher pre-weaning mortality compared to those with a higher intake (p < 0.05), except for the 201-300 g intake (p = 0.472).
   In conclusion, introducing dietary fiber to sows during the transition period reduced constipation and tended to decrease farrowing duration, especially in sows with large litters. Additionally, it lowered pre-weaning piglet mortality by 3.9% in the free-farrowing system. Nonetheless, providing sows with a 75 g/day dietary fiber supplement for only 7 days before farrowing was not enough to enhance colostrum and milk production, nor did it lead to an increase in piglet colostrum consumption.

AB  - Skin dryness, fine lines and wrinkles, red spots, red vasculature, and porphyrin count are common indicators of skin health and beauty. The skincare system in this study contains scientifically validated ingredients such as fermented green tea (Camellia sinensis) water, niacinamide, antioxidants, and a variety of natural plant extracts. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this skincare system in improving facial-skin health and beauty. Twenty-six healthy adults, both female and male, aged 18-54 and of all skin types and tones, were included in the study and participated as either the active or the control group (competitor product) using designated topical products for 30 days. Skin moisture, fine lines and wrinkles, porphyrin count, red spots, and red vasculature count were measured through high-quality photography, Visia (R) complexion analysis, FitSkin (R) skin analysis, and survey questions on day 0, day 8, and day 30. Significant improvements were observed in facial moisture, red-spot count, red vasculature count, and porphyrin count on day 30 in comparison with the control group. Non-significant improvements were observed in pores, skin texture, and wrinkles. With extensive well-documented functional ingredients, the studied skincare system used daily may significantly improve key areas of skin health and beauty.

AB  - Introduction: The developing epigenome changes rapidly, potentially making it more sensitive to toxicant exposures. DNA modifications, including methylation and hydroxymethylation, are important parts of the epigenome that may be affected by environmental exposures. However, most studies do not differentiate between these two DNA modifications, possibly masking significant effects.
   Methods: To investigate the relationship between DNA hydroxymethylation and developmental exposure to common contaminants, a collaborative, NIEHS-sponsored consortium, TaRGET II, initiated longitudinal mouse studies of developmental exposure to human-relevant levels of the phthalate plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and the metal lead (Pb). Exposures to 25 mg DEHP/kg of food (approximately 5mg DEHP/kg body weight) or 32 ppm Pb-acetate in drinking water were administered to nulliparous adult female mice. Exposure began 2 weeks before breeding and continued throughout pregnancy and lactation, until offspring were 21 days old. At 5 months, perinatally exposed offspring blood and cortex tissue were collected, for a total of 25 male mice and 17 female mice (n = 5-7 per tissue and exposure). DNA was extracted and hydroxymethylation was measured using hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (hMeDIP-seq). Differential peak and pathway analysis was conducted comparing across exposure groups, tissue types, and animal sex, using an FDR cutoff of 0.15.
   Results: DEHP-exposed females had two genomic regions with lower hydroxymethylation in blood and no differences in cortex hydroxymethylation. For DEHP-exposed males, ten regions in blood (six higher and four lower) and 246 regions (242 higher and four lower) and four pathways in cortex were identified.Pb-exposed females had no statistically significant differences in blood or cortex hydroxymethylation compared to controls. Pb-exposed males, however, had 385 regions (all higher) and six pathways altered in cortex, but no differential hydroxymethylation was identified in blood.
   Discussion: Overall, perinatal exposure to human-relevant levels of two common toxicants showed differences in adult DNA hydroxymethylation that was specific to sex, exposure type, and tissue, but male cortex was most susceptible to hydroxymethylation differences by exposure. Future assessments should focus on understanding if these findings indicate potential biomarkers of exposure or are related to functional long-term health effects.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disorder that affects an individual's memory, motor functions, behaviour, and thought process. It has been observed that the hippocampus is the first region that gets affected by Alzheimer's. Hence, a study of the hippocampus region can identify genes responsible for the occurrence of the early stage of the disease. Most often, t-test and correlation are used to identify significant genes at the initial level. As the genes are differentially expressed, their classification power is generally high. These genes might appear significant, but their degree of specificity towards the disease might be low, leading to misleading interpretations. Similarly, there may be many false correlations between the genes that can affect the identification of relevant genes. This paper introduces a new framework to reduce the false correlations and find the potential biomarkers for the disease. The framework concerned uses the t-test, correlation, Gene Ontology (GO) categories, and machine learning techniques to find potential genes. The proposed framework detects Alzheimer-related genes and achieves more than 95% classification accuracy in every dataset considered. Some of the identified genes which are directly involved in Alzheimer are APP, GRIN2B, and APLP2. The proposed framework also identifies genes like ZNF621, RTF1, DCH1, and ERBB4, which may play an important role in Alzheimer's. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is also carried out to determine the major GO categories: down-regulated and up-regulated.

AB  - Alternative splicing is a fundamental mechanism that generates functionally distinct proteins from individual genes, contributing to gene regulation and proteomic diversity. In Drosophila, the bunched (bun) gene, a member of the TSC-22 domain gene family, undergoes alternative splicing, yielding diverse protein isoforms involved in crucial biological processes. Nevertheless, the specific roles and regulatory mechanisms of each isoform remain elusive. Here, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 technology to introduce targeted deletions within the endogenous locus of the bun gene, resulting in the removal of either long or short isoforms. We discovered that the short isoforms demonstrated a growth-suppressive role, whereas the long isoforms exhibited a growth-promoting effect. Surprisingly, the long isoforms exhibited a remarkable dual functionality, as both deletion and amplification of long isoform expression impede the excess growth induced by Hippo pathway inactivation. Mechanistically, ectopically expressed Bun long isoforms act as the transcriptional suppressor by competitively binding to targets' promoter regions in conjunction with Yorkie/Scalloped (Yki/Sd), thereby inhibiting its transcriptional outputs and ultimately leading to the growth suppression. These findings unveil the intricate interaction between distinct spliced isoforms of Bun and oncogenic outcomes, highlighting Bun long isoforms as the critical transcription suppressor regulating Hippo pathway inactivation-mediated growth and tumorigenesis in Drosophila.

AB  - At present, Camellia oleifera fruit harvesting relies on manual labor with low efficiency, while mechanized harvesting could result in bud damage because flowering and fruiting are synchronized. As a prerequisite, rapid detection and identification are urgently needed for high accuracy and efficiency with simple models to realize selective and intelligent harvesting. In this paper, a lightweight detection algorithm YOLOv5s-Camellia based on YOLOv5s is proposed. First, the network unit of the lightweight network ShuffleNetv2 was used to reconstruct the backbone network, and thereby the number of computations and parameters of the model was reduced to increase the running speed for saving computational costs. Second, to mitigate the impact of the lightweight improvement on model detection accuracy, three efficient channel attention (ECA) modules were introduced into the backbone network to enhance the network's attention to fruit features, and the Concat operation in the neck network was replaced by the Add operation with fewer parameters, which could increase the amount of information under features while maintaining the same number of channels. Third, the Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELU) activation function was introduced to improve the nonlinear characterization ability of the network. In addition, to improve the ability of the network to locate objects in the natural environment, the penalty index was redefined to optimize the bounding box loss function, which can improve the convergence speed and regression accuracy. Furthermore, the final experimental results showed that this model possesses 98.8% accuracy, 5.5 G FLOPs computation, and 6.3 MB size, and the detection speed reached 60.98 frame/s. Compared with the original algorithm, the calculation amount, size, and parameters were reduced by 65.18%, 56.55%, and 57.59%, respectively. The results can provide a technical reference for the development of a Camellia oleifera fruit-harvesting robot.

AB  - The regulation of cell growth characteristics through physical structures on material surfaces plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of cell behavior. Three-dimensional (3D) microstructures, offering multidimensional growth space and a richer nutrient environment compared to their two-dimensional counterparts, have attracted significant attention from researchers. However, the fabrication of high-precision 3D microstructures, especially those with a high aspect ratio (H-AR), remains challenging. In this study, we employ femtosecond laser to achieve exceptional precision and patterning capabilities in fabricating 3D microstructures. To enhance the manufacturing efficiency of axial 3D structures, we introduce a novel single pulse multi-photon polymerization (SP-MPP) method for efficient fabrication of H-AR micropillar and microtube structures. Our innovative approach involves a dual-aperture optical modulation method that effectively modulates the annular energy distribution, enabling the creation of H-AR microstructures. We can achieve a maximum processing height of up to 130 mu m with an aspect ratio of 16 within single pulse exposure of 217 fs. Compared to the layerby-layer scanning method, our proposed approach enhances the axial manufacturing efficiency of 3D structures by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Through experimentation, we validate the applicability of microtube structures for guiding neuronal orientation by utilizing microtube arrays in hippocampal neuronal cell culture. Our results demonstrate that neurons not only grow along the patterned microtubes but also exhibit preliminary synaptic differentiation. Furthermore, we effectively regulate the 3D patterning of neuronal growth by implementing diverse patterned microtube arrays. This proposed method enables the rapid construction of a large-scale 3D cell growth environment, offering significant advantages in inducing neuronal orientation. Consequently, this technique holds immense potential for diverse applications in biomedicine and tissue engineering, including the establishment of isolated neural networks.

AB  - Hippocampome.org is a mature open-access knowledge base of the rodent hippocampal formation focusing on neuron types and their properties. Previously, Hippocampome.org v1.0 established a foundational classification system identifying 122 hippocampal neuron types based on their axonal and dendritic morphologies, main neurotransmitter, membrane biophysics, and molecular expression (Wheeler et al., 2015). Releases v1.1 through v1.12 furthered the aggregation of literature-mined data, including among others neuron counts, spiking patterns, synaptic physiology, in vivo firing phases, and connection probabilities. Those additional properties increased the online information content of this public resource over 100-fold, enabling numerous independent discoveries by the scientific community. Hippocampome.org v2.0, introduced here, besides incorporating over 50 new neuron types, now recenters its focus on extending the functionality to build real-scale, biologically detailed, data-driven computational simulations. In all cases, the freely downloadable model parameters are directly linked to the specific peer-reviewed empirical evidence from which they were derived. Possible research applications include quantitative, multiscale analyses of circuit connectivity and spiking neural network simulations of activity dynamics. These advances can help generate precise, experimentally testable hypotheses and shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying associative memory and spatial navigation.

AB  - Simple Summary Foot and mouth disease (FMD) affects the productivity and health of several animals species, including cattle. In Afghanistan, cattle represent a valuable source of food security and play a vital role in the rural economy. Using a questionnaire-based approach, we evaluated the self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and practices of various stakeholders involved in the cattle industry and veterinary management of animal health in a northern province of Afghanistan. The study pointed to several aspects that could be translated into practical management options to add value to FMD management in the cattle industry in Afghanistan. This study was performed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) of farmers, animal traders, and veterinary professionals on FMD in Baghlan province, Afghanistan. Four structured questionnaires were administered to the respondents. Almost half (48.5%) of the farmers had heard of the occurrence of FMD in their neighbourhood or knew the name of the disease. The majority of farmers could recognise the clinical signs of FMD in their animals (salivation, 85.9%; tongue ulcers, 78.8%; gum lesions, 78.2%; hoof lesions, 76.8%). Most farmers stated that the "introduction of new animals" was the primary cause of FMD appearing on their farms and to control the spread of the disease, over half of the farmers (56%) preferred not to buy cattle from unknown or potentially infected sources. Animal traders' knowledge was limited to recognising some clinical signs of the disease such as: salivation, and lesions in the mouth and on the feet. No animals were directly imported by the traders from outside Afghanistan. Over half of the local veterinary professionals (65%) kept record books of the animal diseases seen and/or treatment plans undertaken, and 80% of them reported the occurrence of FMD to the provincial, regional, and central veterinary authorities. No regular vaccination programme against FMD was implemented in the province. Poor import controls and quarantine were considered to be the main barriers to the control of FMD in the study area and the surrounding provinces. It can be concluded that, despite relatively good knowledge about FMD in the study area, there are gaps in farmers' and traders' knowledge that need to be addressed to overcome the burden of the disease in the province. These should focus on strengthening interprovincial quarantine measures and implementation of regular vaccination campaigns against the circulating FMDV within the area.

AB  - In Japan, three trematode species of the genus Azygia have been recorded: A. gotoi, A. perryii, and A. rhinogobii. Here, we report the first detection of A. hwangtsiyui in Japan, identified from the introduced snakehead Channa argus. This trematode was previously known only from the snakeheads in mainland China. Between 2015 and 2024, we sampled snakeheads and snails in Japan, collecting adult trematodes and rediae. Adult trematodes were identified morphologically as A. hwangtsiyui, a determination corroborated by molecular analyses of the COI and 28S rDNA regions. Rediae extracted from the snail Sinotaia quadrata histrica were also identified molecularly as A. hwangtsiyui, indicating the snail acts as an intermediate host. Juvenile trematodes from the short-spined Japanese trident goby Tridentiger brevispinis were also morphologically identified as A. hwangtsiyui, indicating that this goby acts as a paratenic host. Given the snakehead's introduction to Japan between 1923 and 1924, the absence of records of later introductions, and the presence of both intermediate and paratenic hosts in Japan at that time, A. hwangtsiyui was likely introduced concurrently with the snakehead. As the detection of three COI haplotypes suggests multiple introductions, subsequent introductions via the aquarium trade or other pathways involving the transport of freshwater fish and mollusks from Asia to Japan are also plausible.

AB  - Introduction Angelman Syndrome (AS) is characterized in large part by the loss of functional UBE3A protein in mature neurons. A majority of AS etiologies is linked to deletion of the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene and epigenetic silencing of the paternal copy. A common therapeutic strategy is to unsilence the intact paternal copy thereby restoring UBE3A levels. Identifying novel therapies has been aided by a UBE3A-YFP reporter mouse model. This study presents an analogous fluorescent UBE3A reporter system in human cells.Methods Previously derived induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) with a Class II large deletion at the UBE3A locus are used in this study. mGL and eGFP are integrated downstream of the endogenous UBE3A using CRISPR/Cas9. These reporter iPSCs are differentiated into 2D and 3D neural cultures to monitor long-term neuronal maturation. Green fluorescence dynamics are analyzed by immunostaining and flow cytometry.Results The reporter is successfully integrated into the genome and reports paternal UBE3A expression. Fluorescence expression gradually reduces with UBE3A silencing in neurons as they mature. Expression patterns also reflect expected responses to molecules known to reactivate paternal UBE3A.Discussion This human-cell-based model can be used to screen novel therapeutic candidates, facilitate tracking of UBE3A expression in time and space, and study human-specific responses. However, its ability to restore UBE3A function cannot be studied using this model. Further research in human cells is needed to engineer systems with functional UBE3A to fully capture the therapeutic capabilities of novel candidates.

AB  - Latent learning is a process that enables the brain to transform experiences into "cognitive maps,"a form of implicit memory, without requiring reinforced training. To investigate its neural mechanisms, we record from hippocampal neurons in mice during latent learning of spatial maps and observe that the high-dimensional neural state space gradually transforms into a low-dimensional manifold that closely resembles the physical environment. This transformation process is associated with the neural reactivation of navigational experiences during sleep. Additionally, we identify a subset of hippocampal neurons that, rather than forming place fields in a novel environment, maintain weak spatial tuning but gradually develop correlated activity with other neurons. The elevated correlation introduces redundancy into the ensemble code, transforming the neural state space into a low-dimensional manifold that effectively links discrete place fields of place cells into a map-like structure. These results suggest a potential mechanism for latent learning of spatial maps in the hippocampus.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive impairment and distinct neuropathological features, including amyloid-(3 plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and reactive astrogliosis. Developing effective diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic strategies for AD necessitates the establishment of animal models that accurately recapitulate the pathophysiological processes of the disease. Existing transgenic mouse models have significantly contributed to understanding AD pathology but often fail to replicate the complexity of human AD. Additionally, these models are limited in their ability to elucidate the interplay among amyloid-(3 plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and reactive astrogliosis due to the absence of spatially and temporally specific genetic manipulation. In this study, we introduce a novel AD mouse model (APP/PS1-TauP301L-Adeno mice) designed to rapidly induce pathological symptoms and enhance understanding of AD mechanisms. Neurofibrillary tangles and severe reactive astrogliosis were induced by injecting AAVDJ-EF1a-hTauP301L-EGFP and Adeno-GFAP-GFP viruses into the hippocampi of 5-month-old APP/PS1 mice. Three months post-injection, these mice exhibited pronounced astrogliosis, substantial amyloid-(3 plaque accumulation, extensive neurofibrillary tangles, accelerated neuronal loss, elevated astrocytic GABA levels, and significant spatial memory deficits. Notably, these pathological features were less severe in AAVTauP301L-expressing APP/PS1 mice without augmented reactive astrogliosis. These findings indicate an exacerbating role of severe reactive astrogliosis in amyloid-(3 plaque and neurofibrillary tangle-associated pathology. The APP/PS1-TauP301L-Adeno mouse model provides a valuable tool for advancing therapeutic research aimed at mitigating the progression of AD.

AB  - The paper explores enhancing the mechanical behavior of stochastic lattice structures through a semi-controlled design approach. By leveraging the Gibson-Ashby model and predefined geometric routines, the study aims to optimize the mechanical response of lattice structures under compressive stress. Transitioning from stochastic to semi-controlled tessellation using Rhinoceros 7 software enables more predictable deformation behavior. Design parameters such as node formation, strut thickness, and lattice generation patterns are correlated with relative density to regulate stiffness and strength. Experimental validation using Acrylic Styrene Acrylonitrile (ASA) filament demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed design model. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding internal mechanics by introducing a novel design approach to control geometry and topology arrangement in shaping lattice properties. By introducing a semi-controlled mechanism, the study seeks to improve the reliability and uniformity of mechanical responses in lattice structures. The findings highlighted the benefits of semi-controlled design approaches in achieving tailored mechanical properties. Specimens were compression tested in quasi-static uniaxial loading and showed that structures created with parabolic distribution dimensioned by hp=0.5hv originated the most reliable and most vital mechanical response compared with other design models, including typical Voronoi distribution. The improved mechanical response in between proposed design models constantly progressed by about 15% on average consecutively, starting from the parabolic distribution dimensioned by hp=1.0hv as the weakest ranked, up to the best one, dimensioned by hp=0.5hv, even better than the typical Voronoi distribution. The proposed design model has introduced an entirely novel approach that significantly enhances the product's volume tessellation using routines that guarantee the validity of geometric and topologic entities. Uniaxial compression tests on lattice blocks highlighted the effect of the proposed approach on the mechanical properties of these structures, having shown particularly crucial repeatability and stability. Overall, the paper contributes to advancing the field of lightweight lattice structures through the novel design methodology and material characterization.

AB  - Insect pests, particularly seed-feeding flies, can cause serious damage to the fruits of many wild orchid species. Evidence of fly damage has been observed in 55 orchid species, belonging to 25 genera, distributed throughout Japan. Although some authors suggested that the observed increase in fly damage to orchids in recent years is related to the introduction of exotic species, the timing and route of spread remain unclear. We examined herbarium specimens of seven orchid species, collected between 1923 and 2016, to collect coarctate pupae and empty puparia, with minimal damage to the specimens. Genomic DNA was then extracted from the insect tissue and species were identified using mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 barcode regions. Long amplicons (660 base pairs [bp]) were obtained from 45.2% of samples and short amplicons (162 bp) were obtained from 90.3% of samples. In total, 51 of 62 samples had nucleotide sequences homologous to Japanagromyza tokunagai, with specimens distributed across collection years and geographic locations. Therefore, the severe damage to Japanese orchids observed in recent years is not related to the recent introduction of an exotic species; it may be related to a rapid increase in a native species. This work highlights the value of herbaria as important resources for elucidating the history and distribution of parasitic insects.

AB  - DEAD-box RNA helicase Vasa is required for gonad development and fertility in multiple animals. Vasa is implicated in many crucial aspects of Drosophila oogenesis, including translation regulation, primordial germ cell specification, piRNA silencing of transposable elements, and maintenance of germline stem cells (GSCs). However, data about Vasa functions in Drosophila spermatogenesis remain controversial. Here we showed that loss-of-function vasa mutations led to failures of GSC maintenance in the testes, a severe loss of total germ cell content, and a cessation of male fertility over time. Defects in GSC maintenance in vasa mutant testes were not associated with an increasing frequency of programmed cell death, indicating that a premature loss of GSCs occurred via entering differentiation. We found that Vasa is implicated in the positive regulation of rhino expression both in the testes and ovaries. The introduction of a transgene copy of rhino, encoding a nuclear component of piRNA pathway machinery, in vasa mutant background allowed us to restore premeiotic stages of spermatogenesis, including the maintenance of GSCs and the development of spermatogonia and spermatocytes. However, piRNA-guided repression of Stellate genes in spermatocytes of vasa mutant testes with additional rhino copy was not restored, and male fertility was disrupted. Our study uncovered a novel mechanistic link involving Vasa and Rhino in a regulatory network that mediates GSC maintenance but is dispensable for the perfect biogenesis of Su(Ste) piRNAs in testes. Thus, we have shown that Vasa functions in spermatogenesis are essential at two distinct developmental stages: in GSCs for their maintenance and in spermatocytes for piRNA-mediated silencing of Stellate genes.

AB  - Social insect colonies are characterized by an efficient division of labor, allowing high-value individuals (i.e., reproductives and brood) to be sheltered from tasks associated with increased risk of pathogen exposure, such as foraging or corpse disposal. This social organization helps limit the transmission of disease throughout the colony. Further, individuals can actively respond to imminent disease threats by altering their behaviors as a means of social immunity. In subterranean termites, although workers typically avoid detected pathogens, they can be attracted to pathogen cues when a nestmate is infected. Infected termites are usually groomed, but they may instead be cannibalized if the infection has already become lethal. The mechanisms governing these changes in behavior are unclear. We set out to examine immediate changes in individual behaviors, investigating the role that the infected individual plays in communicating its infection status to nestmates. We also assessed gradual changes in social organization after the re-introduction of an infected termite to the colony. Our results reveal that infected termites likely do not signal their infection status to nestmates through shaking behaviors and reduced movements, suggesting the occurrence of other mechanisms used in communicating infection. We also found that infected termites do not self-isolate and may travel to the densest part of the colony, where they can potentially benefit from grooming by large groups of nestmates. These results provide new insights into how individual changes in immune behaviors contribute to overall colony health, highlighting that, at early stages of infection, termites favor a rescuing strategy rather than isolation and/or cannibalization.

AB  - Introduction: Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) has been associated with memory impairments, which are typically linked to hippocampal and mesial temporal cortex lesions. Considering the presence of extensive bidirectional frontotemporal connections, it can be hypothesized that executive dysfunction in TLE is modulated by the lateralization of the epileptic foci. Material and Methods: A comprehensive neuropsychological executive functions protocol was administered to 63 participants, including 42 individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy (20 with right-TLE and 22 with left-TLE) and 21 healthy controls aged 20-49. Results: The results indicate that TLE patients exhibit poorer executive performance compared to healthy controls in working memory (F(2,60) = 4.18, p <.01), planning (F(2,60) = 4.71, p <.05), set shifting (F(2,60) = 10.1, p <.001), phonetic verbal fluency (F(2,60) = 11.71, p <.01) and semantic verbal fluency (F(2,60) = 9.61, p <.001. No significant differences were found in cognitive inhibition. Furthermore, right-TLE patients showed lower performance than left-TLE in set shifting (F(1,61) = 6.45, p <.05), while no significant differences were observed in working memory, planning, inhibition, and verbal fluency. Conclusions: This research emphasize the importance of considering the lateralization of the temporal lobe focus to achieve a more accurate neuropsychological characterization. The cognitive differences between left and right TLE patients highlight the need for individualized approaches in their treatment and care.

AB  - Major depression disorder (MDD) has become a common life-threatening disorder. Despite the number of studies and the introduced antidepressants, MDD remains a major global health issue. Carthamus tinctorius (safflower) is traditionally used for food and medical purposes. This study investigated the chemical profile and the antidepressant-like effect of the Carthamus tincto-rius hot water extract in male mice and its mechanism using a transcriptomic analysis. The antidepressant effect of hot water extract (50 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg) was investigated in mice versus the untreated group (saline) and positive control group (fluoxetine 10 mg/kg). Hippocampus transcriptome changes were investigated to understand the Carthamus tinctorius mechanism of action. The GCMS analysis of Carthamus tinctorius showed that hot water extract yielded the highest amount of oleamide as the most active ingredient. Neuro-behavioral tests demonstrated that the safflower treatment significantly reduced immobility time in TST and FST and improved performance in the YMSAT compared to the control group. RNA-seq analysis revealed a significant differential gene expression pattern in several genes such as Ube2j2, Ncor1, Tuba1c, Grik1, Msmo1, and Casp9 related to MDD regulation in 50 mg/kg safflower treatment as compared to untreated and fluoxetine-treated groups. Our findings demonstrated the antidepressant-like effect of safflower hot water extract and its bioactive ingredient oleamide on mice, validated by a significantly shortened immobility time in TST and FST and an increase in the percentage of spontaneous alternation.

AB  - The mechanisms of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and the development of liver fibrosis are not fully understood. Here, we show that deletion of a nuclear seven transmembrane protein, TM7SF3, accelerates HSC activation in liver organoids, primary human HSCs, and in vivo in metabolic -dysfunction -associated steatohepatitis (MASH) mice, leading to activation of the fibrogenic program and HSC proliferation. Thus, TM7SF3 knockdown promotes alternative splicing of the Hippo pathway transcription factor, TEAD1, by inhibiting the splicing factor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNPU). This results in the exclusion of the inhibitory exon 5, generating a more active form of TEAD1 and triggering HSC activation. Furthermore, inhibiting TEAD1 alternative splicing with a specific antisense oligomer (ASO) deactivates HSCs in vitro and reduces MASH diet -induced liver fibrosis. In conclusion, by inhibiting TEAD1 alternative splicing, TM7SF3 plays a pivotal role in mitigating HSC activation and the progression of MASH -related fibrosis.

AB  - Introduction: One of the mechanisms of epileptgenesis is impairment of inhibitory neural circuits. Several studies have compared neural changes among subtypes of gamma-aminobutyric acid-related (GABAergic) neurons after acquired epileptic seizure. However, it is unclear that GABAergic neural modifications that occur during acquisition process of epileptic seizure. Methods: Male rats were injected with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ kindling: n = 30) or saline (control: n = 15) every other day to observe the development of epileptic seizure stages. Two time points were identified: the point at which seizures were most difficult to induce, and the point at which seizures were most easy to induce. The expression of GABAergic neuron-related proteins in the hippocampus was immunohistochemically compared among GABAergic subtypes at each of these time points. Results: Bimodal changes in seizure stages were observed in response to PTZ kindling. The increase of seizure stage was transiently suppressed after 8 or 10 injections, and then progressed again by the 16th injection. Based on these results, we defined 10 injections as a short-term injection period during which seizures are less likely to occur, and 20 injections as a long-term injection period during which continuous seizures are likely to occur. The immunohistochemical analysis showed that hippocampal glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) expression was increased after short-term kindling but unchanged after long-term kindling. Increased GAD65 expression was limited to somatostatin-positive (SOM+) cells among several GABAergic subtypes. By contrast, GAD, GABA, GABAAR alpha 1, GABABR1, and VGAT cells showed no change following short- or long-term PTZ kindling. Conclusion: PTZ kindling induces bimodal changes in the epileptic seizure stage. Seizure stage is transiently suppressed after short-term PTZ injection with GAD65 upregulation in SOM+ cells. The seizure stage is progressed again after long-term PTZ injection with GAD65 reduction to baseline level.

AB  - Utilization of injectable hydrogels stands as a paradigm of minimally invasive intervention in the context of intervertebral disc degeneration treatment. Restoration of nucleus pulposus (NP) function exerts a profound influence in alleviating back pain. This study introduces an innovative class of injectable shear-thinning hydrogels, founded on quaternized chitosan (QCS), gelatin (GEL), and laponite (LAP) with the capacity for sustained release of the anti-inflammatory drug, celecoxib (CLX). First, synthesis of Magnesium-AluminumLayered double hydroxide (LDH) was achieved through a co-precipitation methodology, as a carrier for celecoxib and a source of Mg ions. Intercalation of celecoxib within LDH layers (LDH-CLX) was verified through a battery of analytical techniques, including FTIR, XRD, SEM, EDAX, TGA and UV-visible spectroscopy confirmed a drug loading efficiency of 39.22 +/- 0.09 % within LDH. Then, LDH-CLX was loaded in the optimal GEL-QCSLAP hydrogel under physiological conditions. Release behavior (15 days profile), mechanical properties, swelling ratio, and degradation rate of the resulting composite were evaluated. A G* of 15-47 kPa was recorded for the hydrogel at 22-40 degrees C, indicating gel stability in this temperature range. Self-healing properties and injectability of the composite were proved by rheological measurements. Also, ex vivo injection into intervertebral disc of sheep, evidenced in situ forming and NP cavity filling behavior of the hydrogel. Support of GELQCS-LAP/LDH-CLX (containing mg2+ ions) for viability and proliferation (from -94 % on day 1 to -134 % on day 7) of NP cells proved using MTT assay, DAPI and Live/Dead assays. The hydrogel could significantly upregulate secretion of glycosaminoglycan (GAG, from 4.68 +/- 0.1 to 27.54 +/- 1.0 mu g/ml), when LHD-CLX3% was loaded. We conclude that presence of mg2+ ion and celecoxib in the hydrogel can lead to creation of a suitable environment that encourages GAG secretion. In conclusion, the formulated hydrogel holds promise as a minimally invasive candidate for degenerative disc repair.

AB  - The HSP70 and HSP90 family members belong to molecular chaperones that exhibit protective functions during the cellular response to stressful agents. We investigated whether the exposure of rats to chronic mild stress (CMS), a validated model of depression, affects the expression of HSP70 and HSP90 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HIP) and thalamus (Thal). Male Wistar rats were exposed to CMS for 3 or 8 weeks. The antidepressant imipramine (IMI, 10 mg/kg, i.p., daily) was introduced in the last five weeks of the long-term CMS procedure. Depressive-like behavior was verified by the sucrose consumption test. The expression of mRNA and protein was quantified by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. In the 8-week CMS model, stress alone elevated HSP72 and HSP90B mRNA expression in the HIP. HSP72 mRNA was increased in the PFC and HIP of rats not responding to IMI treatment vs. IMI responders. The CMS exposure increased HSP72 protein expression in the cytosolic fraction of the PFC and HIP, and this effect was diminished by IMI treatment. Our results suggest that elevated levels of HSP72 may serve as an important indicator of neuronal stress reactions accompanying depression pathology and could be a potential target for antidepressant strategy.

AB  - The sodium-citrate cotransporter (NaCT) plays a crucial role in citrate transport during amelogenesis. Mutations in the SLC13A5 gene, which encodes the NaCT, cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 25 and amelogenesis imperfecta. We analyzed developing pig molars and determined that the citrate concentrations in secretory- and maturation-stage enamel are both 5.3 mu mol/g, with about 95% of the citrate being bound to mineral. To better understand how citrate might enter developing enamel, we developed Slc13a5Flag reporter mice that express NaCT with a C-terminal Flag-tag (DYKDDDDK) that can be specifically and accurately recognized by commercially available anti-Flag antibodies. The 24-base Flag coding sequence was located immediately upstream of the natural translation termination codon (TAG) and was validated by Sanger sequencing. The general development, physical activities, and reproductive outcomes of this mouse strain were comparable to those of the C57BL/6 mice. No differences were detected between the Slc13a5Flag and wild-type mice. Tooth development was extensively characterized using dissection microscopy, bSEM, light microscopy, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. Tooth formation was not altered in any detectable way by the introduction of the Flag. The Slc13a5Flag citrate transporter was observed on all outer membranes of secretory ameloblasts (distal, lateral, and proximal), with the strongest signal on the Tomes process, and was detectable in all but the distal membrane of maturation-stage ameloblasts. The papillary layer also showed positive immunostaining for Flag. The outer membrane of odontoblasts stained stronger than ameloblasts, except for the odontoblastic processes, which did not immunostain. As NaCT is thought to only facilitate citrate entry into the cell, we performed in situ hybridization that showed Ank is not expressed by secretory- or maturation-stage ameloblasts, ruling out that ANK can transport citrate into enamel. In conclusion, we developed Slc13a5Flag reporter mice that provide specific and sensitive localization of a fully functional NaCT-Flag protein. The localization of the Slc13a5Flag citrate transporter throughout the ameloblast membrane suggests that either citrate enters enamel by a paracellular route or NaCT can transport citrate bidirectionally (into or out of ameloblasts) depending upon local conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) was introduced into Canada in the early 2000s. This plant bears fruits with high commercial value in other countries due to its premium oil. Nevertheless, sea buckthorn berries are also a rich source of bioactives with nutraceutical potential, especially the variety grown in Newfoundland (Canada), which has not previously been characterized. As such, this study evaluated the composition of polyphenols in sea buckthorn pomace and seeds, as well as their prospective health-promoting effects. RESULTS: Polyphenolic identification by high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet-mass spectrometry-time of flight revealed the presence of 24 compounds in the seeds and 16 compounds in the pomace, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, and tannins, with ellagic acid derivative IV (pomace, 52.13 mu g g(-1)) and (+)-catechin (seeds, 690.8 mu g g(-1)) being the most dominant. Sea buckthorn extracts displayed in vitro antidiabetic and anti-obesity potential by inhibiting alpha-glucosidase (71.52-99.31%) and pancreatic lipase (15.80-35.61%) enzymes, respectively. The extracts also protected low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (50.97-89.67%) and supercoiled DNA (35.11-79.84%) from oxidative damage.

AB  - Most flexible human-machine interfaces emulate the tactile system of the skin, which has the risk of contact damage. Additionally, contact deformation often leads to a hysteresis response. Non-contact interaction can address these problems. Inspired by the electroreception capabilities of the elephantnose fish, this study introduces a non-contact sensing model employing monopolar controlled ionic hydrogel. Compared to most existing mutual capacitive non-contact sensing models, this model not only boosts responsivity by over 3.5 times but also streamlines the sensing architecture. Utilizing this sensing model, a flexible non-contact human-machine interface is developed by organizing three differently shaped hydrogels into an asymmetric configuration. This device reliably discerns six non-contact gestures using machine learning algorithms and supports at least eleven interactive functions by detecting the duration of gestures, enabling continuous real-time control over external devices. This advancement heralds a more liberated paradigm of human-machine interaction with promising implications for the Internet of Things.
   Most tactile human-machine interfaces are prone to deformation hysteresis and contact damage. To address these issues, a bioinspired non-contact sensing model using monopolar controlled ionic hydrogel is proposed, enhancing responsivity while simplifying the sensor structure. The equivalent circuit and empirical formula for this sensing model are derived, facilitating gesture recognition and advancing the development of flexible non-contact human-machine interfaces. image

AB  - Simple Summary This research is aimed at studying the effect of lithium ascorbate on increasing the antioxidant status of gestational sows and reducing the level of lipid peroxidation products. The studies were conducted on gestational sows of the Irish Landrace breed. Thirty days after successful insemination, the sows of the experimental groups, E10, E5 and E2, began to receive lithium ascorbate powder together with compound feed in doses of 10, 5, and 2 mg/kg of live weight, respectively. Weighing and biochemical examination were carried out before the introduction of the substance, as well as on the 60th and 110th days of gestation. In the blood plasma of sows, the following were determined: malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione, SH/SS ratio, activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. The use of lithium ascorbate b caused a significant increase in the level of SH (reduced glutathione) by 21% (p < 0.05), a decrease in the level of SS (oxidized glutathione) by 17% (p < 0.05) and a decrease in the level of malondialdehyde by 60% (p < 0.05). The results obtained cause activation of the antioxidant defense system, reduce the risk of oxidative stress, and have a positive effect on the gestation process. This research is aimed at the influence of different doses of lithium ascorbate on pigs' diet estimation, at farrowing sows' antioxidant status increase, and at lipid peroxidation product level decrease. The research was conducted in farrowing sows of the Irish landrace breed during the second farrow. Three groups of animals were formed, with ten livestock units in each. Thirty days after successful insemination, the sows of the E10, E5 and E2 experimental groups started receiving lithium ascorbate powder together with feed stuff in dosages of 10, 5 and 2 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. Their weighing and biochemical examinations were performed before the substance introduction as well as on the 60th and 110th days of pregnancy. The following were detected in sows' blood plasma: malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione, SH/SS ratio, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity. Lithium ascorbate usage during sows' breeding cycle caused a significant increase in SH (reduced glutathione) level by 21% (p < 0.05), SS (oxidized glutathione) level decrease by 17% (p < 0.05), and malondialdehyde level decrease by 60% (p < 0.05). These data outline antioxidant defense system activization, reducing the risk of oxidative stress under the influence of feeding with lithium ascorbate. Lithium ascorbate in dosages of 10 mg/kg per body weight given together with feed stuff shows prominent adaptogene and stress protective features in the most effective way. The research conducted regarding lithium ascorbate usage for farrowing sows can reduce the negative consequences of oxidative stress, increase sows' health preservation level, and contribute to fertility boost.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of Mycoplasma spp. and their identification in seals from Antarctica. During January and February 2010, 59 Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella), 17 Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii), and 5 Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) were captured in three Antarctic islands. Oral and genital samples were collected, cultured, and cloned. The Intergenic Spacer Region 16S-23S rDNA (ISR) PCR products were sent for sequencing. Seventy-four (91.4%) out of the eighty-one seals sampled were PCR positive. From those, 57 isolates were cultured. Mycoplasmas were more prevalent in the mouth in comparison to the reproductive tract. The percentage of isolates were 76.3%, 58.8%, and 40.0% for Antarctic fur seals, Weddell seals, and Southern elephant seals, respectively. The ISR sequences divided the isolates into six clusters. Four clusters presented a very high similarity percentage with mycoplasma sequences obtained from seals. However, none of these mycoplasmas have been described to date. Cluster 1 is also close to M. miroungigenitalium. This study represents the first report of Mycoplasma species adapted to Antarctic pinnipeds. The findings contribute to the understanding of the ecology of mycoplasmas in Antarctic pinnipeds.

AB  - Introduction: The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is named after the discovery that endogenous cannabinoids bind to the same receptors as the phytochemical compounds found in Cannabis. While endogenous cannabinoids include anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), exogenous phytocannabinoids include Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). These compounds finely tune neurotransmission following synapse activation, via retrograde signaling that activates cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) and/or transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1). Recently, the eCB system has been linked to several neurological diseases, such as neuro-ocular abnormalities, pain insensitivity, migraine, epilepsy, addiction and neurodevelopmental disorders. In the current study, we aim to: (i) highlight a potential link between the eCB system and neurological disorders, (ii) assess if THC exposure alters the expression of eCB-related genes, and (iii) identify evolutionary-conserved residues in CB1R or TRPV1 in light of their function. Methods: To address this, we used several bioinformatic approaches, such as transcriptomic (Gene Expression Omnibus), protein-protein (STRING), phylogenic (BLASTP, MEGA) and structural (Phyre2, AutoDock, Vina, PyMol) analyzes. Results: Using RNA sequencing datasets, we did not observe any dysregulation of eCB-related transcripts in major depressive disorders, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia in the anterior cingulate cortex, nucleus accumbens or dorsolateral striatum. Following in vivo THC exposure in adolescent mice, GPR55 was significantly upregulated in neurons from the ventral tegmental area, while other transcripts involved in the eCB system were not affected by THC exposure. Our results also suggest that THC likely induces neuroinflammation following in vitro application on mice microglia. Significant downregulation of TPRV1 occurred in the hippocampi of mice in which a model of temporal lobe epilepsy was induced, confirming previous observations. In addition, several transcriptomic dysregulations were observed in neurons of both epileptic mice and humans, which included transcripts involved in neuronal death. When scanning known interactions for transcripts involved in the eCB system (n = 12), we observed branching between the eCB system and neurophysiology, including proteins involved in the dopaminergic system. Our protein phylogenic analyzes revealed that CB1R forms a clade with CB2R, which is distinct from related paralogues such as sphingosine-1-phosphate, receptors, lysophosphatidic acid receptors and melanocortin receptors. As expected, several conserved residues were identified, which are crucial for CB1R receptor function. The anandamide-binding pocket seems to have appeared later in evolution. Similar results were observed for TRPV1, with conserved residues involved in receptor activation. Conclusion: The current study found that GPR55 is upregulated in neurons following THC exposure, while TRPV1 is downregulated in temporal lobe epilepsy. Caution is advised when interpreting the present results, as we have employed secondary analyzes. Common ancestors for CB1R and TRPV1 diverged from jawless vertebrates during the late Ordovician, 450 million years ago. Conserved residues are identified, which mediate crucial receptor functions.

AB  - The nursing behavior of sows plays a crucial role in piglet growth, making precise monitoring and robust statistical analysis essential for a comprehensive evaluation of maternal characteristics. This study employed RGB cameras alongside an innovative Recognition Sow Nursing-You Only Look Once (RSN-YOLO) model to effectively monitor sow nursing behavior. The experimental comprised 24 sows of Yorkshire or Landrace breeds, each fostering no more than 13 piglets. The system automatically detected and recorded the start and end times of each nursing episode, enabling the collection and subsequent analysis of both individual sow characteristics and group behaviors. Results indicate that the YOLOv5s object detection model strikes an optimal balance between speed and accuracy, processing frames at 5.7 ms/frame, while achieving a precision rate of 96.3 %, a recall rate of 95.0 %, and a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 97.3 %. Comparisons between these automated detections and manual counts from continuous 24-hour video recordings across five pens confirmed that the method accurately captures both the number of nursing instances and the total duration of nursing with over 95 % accuracy when count errors do not exceed two occurrences. Even when count errors exceed two, accuracy remains above 92 %, with the average duration of each nursing session consistently measured with high precision. The study further revealed that sow nursing behavior does not exhibit a significant day-night rhythm, although notable individual variability within the group is evident. This variability is critical for early identification and intervention in cases where sows exhibit abnormal nursing behaviors relative to overall group patterns. Over a 21-day lactation period, both the total and daily average nursing durations decreased and subsequently stabilized as piglets aged, while the frequency of nursing remained relatively constant. A notable positive correlation (r = 0.67) was found between the number of nursing events and the total nursing duration. Additionally, the results support previous findings that proximally influences the synchronicity of nursing behavior: sows located farther apart are significantly less likely to nurse simultaneously (P < 0.01). Overall, this methodology introduces a novel approach for automating the monitoring of sow nursing behavior on large-scale pig farms. By analyzing individual and group nursing patterns, the approach facilitates the early detection and warning of abnormal nursing behaviors, thereby enhancing the assessment of sow nursing performance and significantly advancing precision livestock farming.

AB  - Our understanding of the transitions of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) between distinct stages of pluripotency relies predominantly on regulation by transcriptional and epigenetic programs with limited insight on the role of established morphological changes. We report remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton of hESCs as they transition from primed to naive pluripotency which includes assembly of a ring of contractile actin filaments encapsulating colonies of naive hESCs. Activity of the Arp2/3 complex is required for formation of the actin ring, to establish uniform cell mechanics within naive colonies, to promote nuclear translocation of the Hippo pathway effectors YAP and TAZ, and for effective transition to naive pluripotency. RNA-sequencing analysis confirms that Arp2/3 complex activity regulates Hippo signaling in hESCs, and impaired naive pluripotency with inhibited Arp2/3 complex activity is rescued by expressing a constitutively active, nuclear-localized YAP-S127A. Moreover, expression of YAP-S127A partially restores the actin filament fence with Arp2/3 complex inhibition, suggesting that actin filament remodeling is both upstream and downstream of YAP activity. These new findings on the cell biology of hESCs reveal a mechanism for cytoskeletal dynamics coordinating cell mechanics to regulate gene expression and facilitate transitions between pluripotency states.

AB  - A facile method for the preparation of oxygen and nitrogen self-doped biochar is developed in this work through the application of one-step chemical activation by using pre-oxidized camellia combing graphene oxide. The extracted results revealed that the obtained biochar had a micropores structure while the nitrogen, oxygen heteroatoms were successfully homogeneously introduced into the carbon frameworks. The specific surface area of the GC-700-4 was about 1343 cm(2) g(-1) with oxygen and nitrogen contents of nearly 15.6 at.% and 2.4 at.%, respectively. When used as an electrode for supercapacitors, the GC-700-4 compound shows the highest area-specific capacitance of 2,206 mF cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2), and capacitance retention of about 97.4% after 5000 cycles. Moreover, the proposed symmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated based on GC-700-4, which exhibits a high gravimetric capacitance value of 236.5 F g(-1) and capacity retention of 94.2% after the enforcement of 10,000 cycles at 20 A g(-1), as well as an excellent rate capability. These results confirm that graphene wrapped in biochar can change its morphology, and improve its conductivity and electrochemical performance, while graphene wrapped on the surface of biochar is only beneficial to improve the cycle stability of capacitors.

AB  - Brain-inspired bionic navigation is a groundbreaking technological approach that emulates the biological navigation systems found in mammalian brains. This innovative method leverages experiences within cognitive space to plan global paths to targets, showcasing remarkable autonomy and adaptability to various environments. This work introduces a novel bionic, goal-oriented path planning approach for mobile robots. First, an experience map is constructed using NeuroSLAM, a bio-inspired simultaneous localization and mapping method. Based on this experience map, a successor representation model is then developed through reinforcement learning, and a goal-oriented predictive map is formulated to address long-term reward estimation challenges. By integrating goal-oriented rewards, the proposed algorithm efficiently plans optimal global paths in complex environments for mobile robots. Our experimental validation demonstrates the method's effectiveness in experience sequence prediction and goal-oriented global path planning. The comparative results highlight its superior performance over traditional Dijkstra's algorithm, particularly in terms of adaptability to environmental changes and computational efficiency in optimal global path generation.

AB  - Flavonoids constitute the main nutraceuticals in the leaves of tea plants (Camellia sinensis). To date, although it is known that drought stress can negatively impact the biosynthesis of flavonoids in tea leaves, the mechanism behind this phenomenon is unclear. Herein, we report a protein phosphorylation mechanism that negatively regulates the biosynthesis of flavonoids in tea leaves in drought conditions. Transcriptional analysis revealed the downregulation of gene expression of flavonoid biosynthesis and the upregulation of CsMPK4a encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase in leaves. Luciferase complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays disclosed that CsMPK4a interacted with CsWD40. Phosphorylation assay in vitro, specific protein immunity, and analysis of protein mass spectrometry indicated that Ser-216, Thr-221, and Ser-253 of CsWD40 were potential phosphorylation sites of CsMPK4a. Besides, the protein immunity analysis uncovered an increased phosphorylation level of CsWD40 in tea leaves under drought conditions. Mutation of the three phosphorylation sites generated dephosphorylated CsWD403A and phosphorylated CsWD403D variants, which were introduced into the Arabidopsis ttg1 mutant. Metabolic analysis showed that the anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin content was lower in ttg1:CsWD403D transgenic plants than ttg1::CsWD403A transgenic and wild type plants. The transient overexpression of CsWD403D downregulated the anthocyanidin biosynthesis in tea leaves. The dual-fluorescein protein complementation experiment showed that CsWD403D did not interact with CsMYB5a and CsAN2, two key transcription factors of procyanidins and anthocyanidins biosynthesis in tea plant. These findings indicate that the phosphorylation of CsWD40 by CsMPK4a downregulates the flavonoid biosynthesis in tea plants in drought stresses.

AB  - In the current article, a developed, patented method denoted the 'Camel Semen Collection Kit-CSCK', was designed to solve the problem of semen collection in dromedary camels. CSCK is composed of three main parts: (1) Semen collection sac: made from supersensitive flexible low-density polyethylene- (LDPE); (2) Metal stainless steel applicator: designed to introduce the collection sac intravaginally and fixate it to the vaginal wall of a female camel through air insufflation; (3) Fixation sticker: a cushion sheet sticker is used to secure the outer portion of the collection sac to the female's perineal area. Semen was collected twice a week from eight dromedary bulls by using electroejaculation (EJ), artificial vagina (AV) and CSCK. Successful semen collections were 81.3%, 84.4% and 43.8% using EJ, CSCK and AV techniques respectively. Semen obtained by EJ technique showed lower semen volume, gross activity, sperm concentration, total sperm motility and percentage of live sperm cells compared to the other two techniques. Semen collected by CSCK showed a longer collection period and higher volume, gross activity, sperm motility and percentage of live spermatozoa and a lower rate of visible contamination compared to AV technique. The advantages and disadvantages of the three techniques were compared and discussed. In conclusion, CSCK represents a practical and easy method to reliably collect high-quality semen from any untrained male dromedary camel and may facilitate the widespread application of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) on a large scale in this species.

AB  - Owing to progressive aging in the population, there is an increase in patients with cognitive impairment. For the prevention of dementia, the use of plant remedies is relevant. Of particular interest is Klasea centauroides (L.) Cass. (Serratula centauroides L., Asteraceae), which has significant natural reserves, contains a wide range of biologically active substances, and is used in folk medicine to treat nervous system diseases. This study aimed to estimate the neuroprotective, energy-protective, and antioxidant effects of K. centauroides extract in cholinergic deficiency caused by long-term scopolamine administration. It has been established that K. centauroides extract accelerates passive avoidance-conditioned reflex development and ensures its preservation over a longer time period under cholinergic deficiency conditions. The K. centauroides extract increases the resistance of brain tissues to the toxic effects of scopolamine, reducing the number of neuron regressive forms in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The K. centauroides extract enhances the predominance of aerobic glycolysis over anaerobic glycolysis and enhances the NADH-dehydrogenase and succinate-dehydrogenase complexes activity, thus promoting more intensive ATP synthesis against this background, the introduction of scopolamine. The use of K. centauroides extracts reduces the malonic dialdehyde (MDA) content in the brain structures and increases the catalase (CAT) and antioxidant system glutathione unit activities.

AB  - Introduction: Maternal vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is associated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), but the exact mechanism remains unclear. Here we explored the mechanism through which VDD induced IUGR.Methods: Female SD rats were fed a control normal diet (VD > 800 IU/Kg) or VDD diet (VD: 0 IU/Kg) for 8 weeks. Then, females were mated with 12-week-old male SD rats, and fetal and placental tissue were collected on the gestational day 13 (GD13) or 18 (GD18) to analyze the effects of VDD on pregnancy outcome and embryonic development. In vitro, the VDR gene of HTR-8/SVneo cells was knocked down to establish VDD model. Then, HTR-8/SVneo cells were treated with the MST1/2 inhibitor XMU-MP-1 or 0.1 mu M/L calcitriol for 24 h (h). The mechanism of Hippo-YAP signaling pathway in VDD-induced placental dysplasia was further investigated by western blot, invasion assay, wound healing assay and Hoechst/PI staining. Results: The IUGR of the pregnant rats in the VDD group was significant, the placental structure and function were damaged, and there was an obvious inflammatory response, accompanied by a significant increase in the level of the transcription co-activator YAP phosphorylation. In vitro, VDD significantly inhibited the migratory and invasive abilities of HTR-8/SVneo cells, accompanied by decreased EMT capacity and increased apoptosis. When intervening with XMU-MP-1 in advance, we found that the effects of VDD were neutralized by Hippo-YAP signaling blocker.Discussion: Maternal VDD causes placental dysplasia and IUGR, and these abnormal changes may be associated with the activation of Hippo-YAP signaling pathway.

AB  - Introduction Electrical stimulation of the brain has shown promising prospects in treating various brain diseases. Although biphasic pulse stimulation remains the predominant clinical approach, there has been increasing interest in exploring alternative stimulation waveforms, such as sinusoidal stimulation, to improve the effectiveness of brain stimulation and to expand its application to a wider range of brain disorders. Despite this growing attention, the effects of sinusoidal stimulation on neurons, especially on their nonlinear firing characteristics, remains unclear.Methods To address the question, 50 Hz sinusoidal stimulation was applied on Schaffer collaterals of the rat hippocampal CA1 region in vivo. Single unit activity of both pyramidal cells and interneurons in the downstream CA1 region was recorded and analyzed. Two fractal indexes, namely the Fano factor and Hurst exponent, were used to evaluate changes in the long-range correlations, a manifestation of nonlinear dynamics, in spike sequences of neuronal firing.Results The results demonstrate that sinusoidal electrical stimulation increased the firing rates of both pyramidal cells and interneurons, as well as altered their firing to stimulation-related patterns. Importantly, the sinusoidal stimulation increased, rather than decreased the scaling exponents of both Fano factor and Hurst exponent, indicating an increase in the long-range correlations of both pyramidal cells and interneurons.Discussion The results firstly reported that periodic sinusoidal stimulation without long-range correlations can increase the long-range correlations of neurons in the downstream post-synaptic area. These results provide new nonlinear mechanisms of brain sinusoidal stimulation and facilitate the development of new stimulation modes.

AB  - We tested whether utilising the male effect to stimulate ewes before the mating period can reduce the time to conception following the introduction of entire rams, and increase fertility, prolificacy, and reproductive rate (number of fetuses per 100 ewes exposed to fertile rams). A retrospective analysis was used to analyse records from 59,716 ewes collected over 34 years (1986-2020) from seven genotypes: Border Leicester, Composite (crossbred), Dorset, Merino, Dorset x Polypay, Rambouillet, White Suffolk. The dataset also included nulliparous young ewes (mated at age 8 months) and adult parous ewes. Vasectomized rams were used to stimulate 20,632 ewes before a mating period that lasted 2 or 3 estrous cycles, and the outcomes were compared with those from 39,084 ewes that had not been stimulated. Independently of genotype, utilising the male stimulus advanced the average conception date by 8 days for young ewes (P < 0.0001) and by 1 day for adult ewes (P < 0.0001). The male stimulus also increased the proportion of ewes that conceived in their first cycle by 33 % for young ewes and by 6 % for adult ewes (P < 0.0001). For the cycle of conception, there were significant (P < 0.0001) effects of two interactions: male stimulus x age at mating and male stimulus x live weight at mating. The male stimulus improved fertility in both adult ewes (99.8 % vs 89 %; P < 0.001) and young ewes (77.7 % vs 81.3 %; P < 0.001). The male stimulus increased the number of young ewes (41.9 % vs 11.1 %; P < 0.001) and adult ewes (16.6 % vs 2.7 %; P < 0.001) that conceived multiple fetuses in the first 17 days of the mating period. The reproductive rate was improved by the male stimulus in young ewes (129 % vs 135 %; P < 0.001) but not in adult ewes (120 % vs 122 %; P = 0.12). When all animals for all breeds were included in the analyses, there were improvements in fertility, prolificacy, and reproductive rate as age and live weight increased at mating (P < 0.0001). We conclude that, independently of genotype, utilising the male stimulus before the mating period reduces the time to conception and improves reproductive performance in both young and adult ewes.

AB  - Ischemic stroke leads to acute neuron death and forms an injured core, triggering delayed cell death at the penumbra. The impaired brain functions after ischemic stroke are hardly recovered because of the limited regenerative properties. However, recent rodent intervention studies manipulating the extracellular environments at the subacute phase shed new light on the regenerative potency of the injured brain. This review introduces the rational design of artificial extracellular matrix (ECM) mimics using supramolecular peptidic scaffolds, which self-assemble via non-covalent bonds and form hydrogels. The facile customizability of the peptide structures allows tuning the hydrogels' physical and biochemical properties, such as charge states, hydrophobicity, cell adhesiveness, stiffness, and stimuli responses. Supramolecular peptidic materials can create safer and more economical drugs than polymer materials and cell transplantation. We also discuss the importance of activating developmental programs for the recovery at the subacute phase of ischemic stroke. Self-assembling molecular medicine mimicking the ECMs and activating developmental programs may stand as a new drug modality of regenerative medicine in various tissues.

AB  - BACKGROUNDIn the present study, medium and long-chain triacylglycerol (MLCT) was synthesized from camellia oil (CO) and medium chain triglyceride by enzymatic transesterification. Novel MLCT oleogel was constructed using MLCT as substrate oil, as well as beta-sitosterol /gamma-oryzanol (SO), monoglyceride and carnauba wax as oleogelators, and the regulation mechanism of MLCT on self-assembly behavior was investigated.RESULTSThe G ', apparent viscosity, oil binding capacity and hardness of the three MLCT oleogels were reduced compared to CO oleogels. The hydrogen bond strength and intermolecular force of MLCT oleogel was lower than that of CO oleogel, which explains the lower crystal amount and weak thermal stability of MLCT oleogel. Furthermore, MLCT have a lower long carbon chain fatty acids (LCFAs) content than CO, helping to reduce the calorie of the oleogels. Among the three MLCT oleogels, ML-SO formed a strong network with the highest mechanical strength and thermal stability.CONCLUSIONThe introduction of medium chain fatty acids into the glycerol skeleton weaken the gel network structure of oleogel, and this weakening effect was a result of the decrease of unsaturation and LCFAs content in MLCT. This study provides a direction for the development of low calorie functional plastic fat. (c) 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - The prevalence of depressive disorders in women has been reported in many countries. However, the cellular mechanisms mediating such sex differences in stress susceptibility remain largely unknown. Previously, we showed that lateral habenula (LHb) neurons are more activated in female mice than in male mice by restraint stress. Given the important role of LHb in depressive disorders, we aimed to investigate the synaptic differences between male and female LHb and to examine the possible impact of the estrous cycle on neurotransmission in LHb. We found that the passive and active properties of LHb neurons differed according to the estrous cycle. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents exhibited higher amplitudes during the diestrus stage and lower frequencies in females than in males, whereas inhibitory postsynaptic currents showed no significant differences. Acute stress-induced hyperpolarization of resting membrane potentials (RMP) was observed in both sexes, with notable changes in female silent and tonic neurons. Stress exposure eliminated estrous cycle-dependent RMP differences and introduced cycle-specific excitability changes, especially in the metestrus and diestrus stages, suggesting that the hormonal cycle may set the synaptic tone of the LHb, thus modulating stress responses in females. Our study provides invaluable groundwork for understanding the detailed interaction between the estrous cycle and stress exposure in female LHb.

AB  - Introduction: Tau is a microtubule associated phosphoprotein found principally in neurons. Prevailing dogma continues to define microtubule stabilization as the major function of tau in vivo, despite several lines of evidence suggesting this is not the case. Most importantly, tau null mice have deficits in axonal outgrowth and neuronal migration while still possessing an extensive microtubule network. Instead, mounting evidence suggests that tau may have a major function in the regulation of fast axonal transport (FAT) through activation of neuronal signaling pathways. Previous studies identified a phosphatase activating domain (PAD) at the tau N-terminal that is normally sequestered, but is constitutively exposed in tauopathies. When exposed, the PAD activates a signaling cascade involving PP1 and GSK3 beta which affects cellular functions including release of cargo from kinesin. Furthermore, we discovered that PAD exposure can be regulated by a single phosphorylation at T205. Exposure of the PAD is an early event in multiple tauopathies and a major contributing factor to neurodegeneration associated with tau hyperphosphorylation. However, effects of tau PAD exposure on anterograde FAT raised the interesting possibility that this pathway may be a mechanism for physiological regulation of cargo delivery through site-specific phosphorylation of tau and transient activation of PP1 and GSK3 beta. Significantly, there is already evidence of local control of PP1 and GSK3 beta at sites which require cargo delivery.Methods: To investigate this hypothesis, first we evaluated cellular localization of tau PAD exposure, pT205 tau phosphorylation, and active GSK3 beta in primary hippocampal neurons during development. Second, we analyzed the axonal outgrowth of tau knockout neurons following transfection with full length hTau40-WT, hTau40-& UDelta;PAD, or hTau40-T205A.Results and Discussion: The results presented here suggest that transient activation of a PP1-GSK3 beta signaling pathway through locally regulated PAD exposure is a mechanism for cargo delivery, and thereby important for neurite outgrowth of developing neurons.

AB  - Photothermal neural activity inhibition has emerged as a minimally invasive neuromodulation technology with submillimeter precision. One of the techniques involves the utilization of plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to modulate neural activity by photothermal effects ("thermoplasmonics"). A surface modification technique is often required to integrate AuNPs onto the neural interface. Here, polydopamine (pDA), a multifunctional adhesive polymer with a wide light absorption spectrum, is introduced both as a primer layer for the immobilization of gold nanorods (GNRs) on the neural interface and as an additional photothermal agent by absorbing near-infrared red (NIR) lights for more efficient photothermal effects. First, the optical and photothermal properties of pDA as well as the characteristics of GNRs attached onto the pDA film are investigated for the optimized photothermal neural interface. Due to the covalent bonding between GNR surfaces and pDA, GNRs immobilized on pDA showed strong attachment onto the surface, yielding a more stable photothermal platform. Lastly, when photothermal neural stimulation was applied to the primary rat hippocampal neurons, the substrate with GNRs immobilized on the pDA film allowed more laser power-efficient photothermal neuromodulation as well as photothermal cell death. This study suggests the feasibility of using pDA as a surface modification material for developing a photothermal platform for the inhibition of neural activities.

AB  - Exercise is shown to improve cognitive function in various human and animal studies. Laboratory mice are often used as a model to study the effects of physical activity and running wheels provide a voluntary and non-stressful form of exercise. The aim of the study was to analyze whether the cognitive state of a mouse is related to its wheel-running behavior. Twenty-two male C57BL/6NCrl mice (9.5 weeks old) were used in the study. The cognitive function of group-housed mice (n = 5-6/group) was first analyzed in the IntelliCage system followed by individual phenotyping with the PhenoMaster with access to a voluntary running wheel. The mice were divided into three groups according to their running wheel activity: low, average, and high runners. The learning trials in the IntelliCage showed that the high-runner mice exhibited a higher error rate at the beginning of learning trials but improved their outcome and learning performance more compared to the other groups. The high-runner mice ate more compared to the other groups in the PhenoMaster analyses. There were no differences in the corticosterone levels between the groups, indicating similar stress responses. Our results demonstrate that high-runner mice exhibit enhanced learning capabilities prior to access to voluntary running wheels. In addition, our results also show that individual mice react differently when introduced to running wheels, which should be taken into consideration when choosing animals for voluntary endurance exercise studies.

AB  - This paper explores and identifies commonalities among recent Digital Twin (DT) technology definitions. additionally, it introduces a framework for a digital twin of Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) focusing on English wheel manufacturing as its foundational context. To achieve this, two 3D simulators, namely Grasshopper and Rhino, were employed to faithfully replicate the English wheel process digitally. Subsequently, optimizing these simulators' performance paved the way for a comprehensive visualization of the English wheel using the Microsoft HoloLens. This visualization integrates digital and physical interactions, resulting in a mixed reality environment. The ultimate goal of this research is to enable a bi-directional collaboration within the digital representation of the English wheel, bridging the gap between the virtual and physical realms.

AB  - Introduction: Perinatal stroke causes lasting neurological deficits and there are currently no effective treatment options. Established animal models of perinatal stroke do not always mimic the clinical presentation of neonatal injury or are technically challenging to perform. The photothrombotic (PT) stroke model is a minimally invasive method that replicates focal ischaemic injury. Few studies have applied the PT model in neonatal contexts, and none have examined both short- and long-term effects across varying injury severities. This study aimed to optimize a protocol to create a mild model of perinatal stroke and subsequently characterize injury progression, neuropathological impact, and motor deficits over time. Methods: On postnatal day 10 we used the PT method to induce perinatal stroke in rat pups. Pups were exposed to various light exposure times (10, 20, or 30 min) to determine the optimal time needed to produce a mild and reproducible cortical stroke injury. Behavioural assessments were conducted on days 4, 10, 20, and 30 post-injury. Brains were collected for analysis on days 3 and 40 post-injury. Results: Three days post-injury, the 20 and 30 min group had significant focal lesions and microbleeds were present in each of the PT groups. All PT groups showed significant neuron loss in the peri-infarct region and the thalamus, and microglia activation in multiple brain regions. As 30 min of light exposure showed extensive cortical tissue loss (>70%), we excluded the 30-min group from long-term assessment. 40 days post-injury, the 10 and 20 min groups demonstrated significant tissue loss and neuronal loss in the peri-infarct region and thalamus, but only the 20 min group showed neuron loss in the hippocampus. The 10 and 20 min groups both demonstrated ongoing motor deficits. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that increasing light exposure time in PT stroke results in a more severe stroke phenotype. 30 min of light exposure resulted in a severe injury at only 3 days post insult, therefore, was not further investigated. 10 and 20 min of light exposure had a similar effect at 3 days, however, after 40 days the 20 min exposure time created a moderate injury phenotype. From this study, we propose that 10 min of light exposure is optimal to create a mild stroke phenotype and is associated with motor deficits and altered neuropathology. This injury phenotype provides a focal and reproducible insult, while still being mild enough to feasibly test therapeutics.

AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated protein 9) technology is growing rapidly and has been greatly influencing the efficiency and effectiveness of genetic modifications in different applications. One aspect of research gaining importance in the development of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is the introduction of CRISPR materials into target organisms. Although we previously demonstrated the efficacy of electroporation- and lipofection-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 gene disruption in porcine zygotes, we still believe that the efficiency of this system could be improved by combining these two methods. The present study was thus conducted to clarify the effects of a combination of electroporation and lipofection for delivering CRISPR/Cas9 components into zona pellucida (ZP)-intact and -free zygotes. The results revealed that electroporation alone significantly increased the biallelic mutation rates in the resulting blastocysts compared to lipofection alone, irrespective of the presence of ZP. None of ZP-intact zygotes treated by lipofectamine alone had any mutations, suggesting that removal of the ZP is necessary for enabling CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing via lipofection treatment in the zygotes. Additional lipofectamine treatment after electroporation did not improve the rates of total and biallelic mutations in the resulting blastocysts derived from either ZP-intact or -free zygotes.

AB  - Energy consumption is constantly increasing all around the world, and one of the substantial energy consumption fields is the electricity required for lighting in buildings. There are various approaches to tackle this problem, among which the use of transparent facades is the common method to reduce electrical energy consumption in modern buildings such as museums; However, these solutions have many problems, such as space security, heat gains during summer, and glare; The main problems related to transparent facades are energy loss through light transmitting seams and visual discomfort. Hence, it is necessary to develop a new method that can pass natural light to enhance visual comfort without damaging the thermal insulation of the building's exterior walls. One solution that can be given to this issue is using light transmitting concrete. In this study, five high-performance light transmitting concrete samples, including the different amounts of optical fiber were made, and their performances in terms of daylight and electricity saving have been analyzed based on simulation with Diva for Rhino software. For a better comparison between different studies, the analysis was done based on the reference office, which had been used in previous relevant studies. As a result, the reference office was modeled in 6 cities (Tehran, Houston, Phoenix, San Francisco, Vancouver, & Chicago). It was found that using this material along with using lighting sensors resulted in 45.7%, 31.5%, and 38.8% electricity saving for offices in Tehran, Vancouver, and Phoenix, respectively, and also can increase UDI (Useful Daylight Illuminance) by about 39% in Tehran.

AB  - Soft tissue growth is crucial across various physiological applications, with mathematical modelling playing a pivotal role in understanding the underlying processes. The volumetric growth theory serves as a commonly used mathematical framework in this context. Our previous research on volumetric growth theory primarily concentrated on defining the incremental growth tensor in loaded and stressed configurations, revealing that this approach closely aligns with experimental observations of residual hoop stress distribution. However, given the assumptions employed, the approach has limitations in accurately predicting the growth timeline. In this work, we address these issues by incorporating the effect of initial residual strain and introducing a new mixed trigger growth evolution law. In this growth law, we do not use growth saturation as an upper limit, as this assumption cannot represent many physiological conditions. Instead, we propose that growth in soft tissues leads to a new equilibrium state. To illustrate this idea, we introduce a growth incompatibility function, denoted as I . We establish the analytical relationship between I and the opening angle in a simplified cylindrical geometry resembling the structure of the heart or arteries. We put forth a revised growth law that is both stress and incompatibility driven/Our results show that by using this mixed trigger growth law, tissues will not grow indefinitely. Instead, a stress-driven homeostasis incompatibility state will be reached. In addition, by accounting for the initial opening angle in the model, we can accurately trace the growth history of the heart, aligning with experimental data obtained from measuring the opening angle in young pigs from birth to maturity.

AB  - Genome editing is a rapidly advancing technology with transformative potential in livestock, offering opportunities that range from enhanced production traits to the generation of biomedical models for human disease and xenotransplantation. The CRISPR/Cas9 system, originally identified as a bacterial defense mechanism, has become the most widely used tool for precise genome editing. In this review, we first summarize the potential applications of CRISPR/Cas9 in livestock and highlight notable successes to date. We then address the ongoing challenges associated with delivering CRISPR/Cas9 into gametes and embryos, as current methods such as microinjection and electroporation often result in high mosaicism and cellular damage. We subsequently introduce extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a promising alternative delivery system. Secreted by virtually all cell types, EVs can efficiently transport bioactive molecules and are readily internalized by gametes and embryos. Although EV-mediated delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 has shown success in somatic cells, its use in reproductive cells remains largely unexplored. We review emerging strategies for loading EVs with CRISPR/Cas components and discuss the potential advantages of combining this approach with recently developed smaller Cas variants to overcome delivery barriers. Collectively, these innovations support the promise of EVs as a biologically compatible, efficient, and minimally invasive system for targeted genome editing in livestock reproduction.
   Sentence Delivery tools of gene editing systems with minimal damage and maximal efficacy are essential. Extracellular vesicles are naturally secreted nanostructures that offer a promising alternative for delivering CRISPR/Cas9 into gametes and embryos.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Precision livestock farming (PLF) will have a profound influence on animal husbandry, farm animal welfare and animal-based production chains. Even though consumers ultimately pay the costs of innovations, their perceptions of PLF technologies have been under-investigated. To explore consumer perceptions of PLF technologies within the pork and dairy value chains, altogether six focus group discussions were conducted in Finland, the Netherlands and Spain. The results indicate that consumers expect that PLF technologies will enhance the health and welfare of farm animals, while generating environmental improvements and increasing transparency in livestock farming. They, however, also expressed the fear that PLF technologies will lead to more industrialisation in livestock farming; that PLF technologies and data are vulnerable to misuse and cyber-crime; and that PLF information may be inadequately communicated to consumers. The findings are used to formulate directions for strengthening the acceptance of PLF technologies among European consumers.
   Scholars in the fields of animal science and technology have investigated how precision livestock farming (PLF) can contribute to the quality and efficiency of animal husbandry and to the health and welfare of farm animals. Although the results of such studies provide promising avenues for the development of PLF technologies and their potential for the application in animal husbandry, the perspectives of consumers with regard to PLF technologies have yet to be the subject of much investigation. To address this research gap, the current study explores consumer perceptions of PLF technologies within the pork and dairy value chains. The investigation is based on results from six focus group discussions conducted in three European countries, each reflecting a different market environment: Finland, the Netherlands and Spain. The results indicate that consumers expect the implementation of different PLF technologies to enhance the health and welfare of farm animals, while generating environmental improvements and increasing the transparency of value-chain processes. The analysis further reveals three over-arching consumer concerns: (1) the fear that the integration of PLF technologies will introduce more industrialisation into livestock farming production; (2) the concern that PLF technologies and data are vulnerable to misuse and cyber-crime; and (3) the concern that PLF information is not communicated adequately to allow informed purchase decisions. The research findings provide directions for members of the animal-based food value chain to make informed decisions to improve their sustainability, social responsibility and credibility by endorsing the acceptance of PLF (technologies) amongst European consumers.

AB  - Implant-based breast reconstruction is a common standard of care for breast cancer patients following mastectomy. To support implant weight and placement, surgeons utilize autologous tissues, acellular dermal matrices (ADMs), or synthetic meshes. While ADMs provide structural support, they present significant risks, including infection transmission and seroma. Conversely, synthetic meshes exhibit poor cellular adhesion, leading to inadequate tissue integration. To address these challenges, there is a need for a matrix that enhances tissue integration while minimizing infection risks and other complications. Silk fibroin (SF), a natural biopolymer, possesses excellent biocompatibility and mechanical properties. This study introduces a novel engineered silk matrix (ESM) as an advanced solution for soft tissue regeneration, specifically in breast reconstruction surgery. The present study establishes the safety of ESM and evaluates its potential a tissue regeneration matrix through extensive in-vitro and in-vivo analyses. In-vitro assays demonstrated superior cellular adhesion, proliferation of human mammary fibroblast cells (HMFCs), collagen deposition and angiogenesis in ESM compared to collagen matrices and ADMs. Safety assessments, conducted in accordance with ISO 10993 guidelines, confirmed noncytotoxic nature of ESM. Furthermore, subcutaneous implantation revealed no systemic toxicity or adverse tissue reactions. In-vivo studies utilizing a Yorkshire pig model of simulated breast reconstruction surgery, demonstrated superior performance of ESM over collagen matrices in tissue regeneration. The findings showed enhanced fibroblast density, increased collagen deposition, and improved vascularization. These results suggest that ESM is a safer and more effective alternative to ADMs in breast reconstruction, with the potential to revolutionize post-mastectomy care for breast cancer patients.

AB  - With the extensive application of data analysis in various parts of the landscape design process, Building Information Modeling (BIM), City Information Modeling (CIM), and Landscape Information Modeling (LIM) all aim to achieve key data sharing and collaboration in the whole cycle and promote the development of smart cities. Landscape element indicators are complex, diverse, and difficult to quantify, which is one of the reasons for the slow development of LIM. However, with the development requirements of LIM, quantifying landscape elements and transforming landscapes into digital landscape information has become a hot spot in the landscape design industry. Landscape parametric design aims to transform the design elements into quantifiable parameters, obtain the design scheme by changing the value of the parameters, and form the design results based on digital information. It is one of the foundations of LIM. Based on the Rhino + Grasshopper (R+G) platform, this study takes Shuixizhuang Park as an example and establishes the parametric design approach for the park entrance. The approach involves several steps: (1) Confirming the boundary and key points of the park to prepare the basic data for parametric design. (2) Utilizing the Physarealm Algorithm Method (PAM) to simulate crowd paths, the Site Slope Algorithm Model (SSAM) to analyze terrain slope, the Road Intersection Algorithm Model (RIAM) to determine the scope of the park entrance area based on the national and local design codes, and the Crowd Density Algorithm Model (CDAM) and Crowd Convenience Algorithm Model (CCAM) to analyze the density and convenience of the crowd to preliminarily confirm the park entrance. (3) Meeting the basic requirements of the crowd and vehicle gathering and spread by using the Square Area Review Algorithm Model (SARAM) and Parking Lot Review Algorithm Model (PLRAM) to recheck the site area of the park entrance square and park lot to optimize the park entrance. This approach constructs several site analysis models based on the R+G platform and introduces PAM to analyze crowd activity paths, proposing a landscape parametric design method that integrates crowd activity and landscape design requirements. Compared with the classical design, the landscape parametric design derived from the comprehensive data analysis reduces human interference, is more scientific and practical, and better meets the requirements of people entering the park. The approach also provides ideas for other landscape parametric site selections. By adjusting the values of element parameters, the approach can also be applied to the site selection and design of other landscapes.

AB  - Elephant herding optimization (EHO) has received widespread attention due to its few control parameters and simple operation but still suffers from slow convergence and low solution accuracy. In this paper, an improved algorithm to solve the above shortcomings, called Gaussian perturbation specular reflection learning and golden-sine-mechanism-based EHO (SRGS-EHO), is proposed. First, specular reflection learning is introduced into the algorithm to enhance the diversity and ergodicity of the initial population and improve the convergence speed. Meanwhile, Gaussian perturbation is used to further increase the diversity of the initial population. Second, the golden sine mechanism is introduced to improve the way of updating the position of the patriarch in each clan, which can make the best-positioned individual in each generation move toward the global optimum and enhance the global exploration and local exploitation ability of the algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, tests are performed on 23 benchmark functions. In addition, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Friedman tests with 5% are invoked to compare it with other eight metaheuristic algorithms. In addition, sensitivity analysis to parameters and experiments of the different modifications are set up. To further validate the effectiveness of the enhanced algorithm, SRGS-EHO is also applied to solve two classic engineering problems with a constrained search space (pressure-vessel design problem and tension-/compression-string design problem). The results show that the algorithm can be applied to solve the problems encountered in real production.

AB  - Despite the eradication of smallpox four decades ago, poxviruses continue to be a threat to humans and animals. The arsenal of anti-poxvirus agents is very limited and understanding mechanisms of resistance to agents targeting viral DNA polymerases is fundamental for the development of antiviral therapies. We describe here the phenotypic and genotypic characterization of poxvirus DNA polymerase mutants isolated under selective pressure with different acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, including HPMPC (cidofovir), cHPMPC, HPMPA, cHPMPA, HPMPDAP, HPMPO-DAPy, and PMEO-DAPy, and the pyrophosphate analogue phosphonoacetic acid. Vaccinia virus (VACV) and cowpox virus drug-resistant viral clones emerging under drug pressure were characterized phenotypically (drug-susceptibility profile) and genotypically (DNA polymerase sequencing). Different amino acid changes in the polymerase domain and in the 3'-5' exonuclease domain were linked to drug resistance. Changes in the 3'-5' domain emerged earlier than in the polymerase domain when viruses acquired a combination of mutations. Our study highlights the importance of poxvirus DNA polymerase residues 314, 613, 684, 688, and 851, previously linked to drug resistance, and identified several novel mutations in the 3'-5' exonuclease domain (M313I, F354L, D480Y) and in the DNA polymerase domain (A632T, T831I, E856K, L924F) associated with different drug-susceptibility profiles. Furthermore, a combination of mutations resulted in complex patterns of cross-resistance. Modeling of the VACV DNA polymerase bearing the newly described mutations was performed to understand the effects of these mutations on the structure of the viral enzyme. We demonstrated the emergence of drug-resistant DNA polymerase mutations in complex patterns to be considered in case such mutations should eventually arise in the clinic.

AB  - Introduction: Many socially significant diseases are associated with prenatal developmental disorders. Previously, we showed the pathological role of hypoxia-inducible factor HIF1 in post-hypoxic reoxygenation. This study aimed to investigate the effect of prenatal severe hypoxia (PSH) on HIF1 alpha protein expression as well as on HIF1-dependent activity of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and anaerobic glycolysis in the hippocampus (HPC) of offspring that reached adulthood.Methods: PSH was induced during the critical period of fetal hippocampal formation on gestation days 14-16 in a hypobaric chamber (180 Torr, 5% oxygen, 3 hours). Subsequent studies were conducted on both the HPC of adult control and PSH rats under normal conditions, as well as in response to severe hypobaric hypoxia (SH) or psycho-emotional stress ("learned helplessness" model, LH). We evaluated HIF1 alpha protein levels using both immunohistochemistry and western blotting techniques. The amount of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was also determined by western blotting. Colorimetric enzymatic assays were employed to analyze enzymatic activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the concentration of lactate, NADPH, reduced glutathione (GSHred), and malonic dialdehyde (MDA).Results: We showed that PSH caused a stable increase in the content of HIF1 alpha protein in the HPC, which was accompanied by an increase in the efficiency of anaerobic glycolysis. This was confirmed by increased LDH activity and lactate concentration. At the same time, the amounts of G6PD, NADPH, and reduced glutathione decreased in the HPC of PSH rats, whereas the concentration of MDA, an oxidative stress marker, exceeded the control values. In a series of experiments using the LH or SH stress, it was shown that in the HPC of control rats, there was an increase in the amount of HIF1 alpha in response to stress, which was also accompanied by more efficient anaerobic glycolysis and decreased of PPP-dependent NADPH production, similar to the intact PSH rats. In PSH rats, emotional stress resulted in higher HIF1 alpha levels without affecting glycolysis or PPP.Conclusion: Therefore, the increased content and activity of the transcription factor HIF1 alpha in the HPC of adult rats exposed to prenatal hypoxia leads to an imbalance between glycolysis and PPP, which is accompanied by oxidative stress.

AB  - Non-native lady beetle species have often been introduced, with variable success, into North America for biological control of aphids, scales, whiteflies, and other agricultural pests. Two predatory lady beetle species, Propylea quatuordecimpunctata and Hippodamia variegata , both originating from Eurasia, were first discovered near Montreal, Quebec, in North America in 1968 and 1984, respectively, and have since expanded into northeastern North America and the midwestern United States. In this study, we estimate the range -wide population structure, establishment and range -expansion, and recent evolutionary history of these lady beetle species using reduced -representation genotyping-by-sequencing via ddRADseq. In addition, we quantified the responses to a key abiotic factor, photoperiod, that regulates adult reproductive diapause in these two species and may influence their geographical range in North America. Our analyses detect: (1) non -significant genetic differentiation and divergence among North American populations that likely originated from a single accidental introduction, (2) evidence of reduced contemporary gene flow within the continental US, and (3) minor phenotypic differences in diapause induction between populations of the two species from the same location.

AB  - In this study, two acidic Biluochun Tea polysaccharides (BTP-A11 and BTP-A12) were investigated comparatively, which mainly consisted of Rha, Ara, Gal and GalA, possibly suggesting their pectic nature. Structurally, their galacturonan backbones composed of -> 4)-alpha-D-GalpA-(1 -> and -> 2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1 -> were revealed similar, while Ara-and Gal-based branches attached to the O-2 of -> 2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1 -> were in distinctive types, proportions, extensibilities and branching degrees. This could lead to their different macromolecular characteristics, where BTP-A(11) with higher M-w presented a more hyper-branched chain conformation and relatively higher structural flexibility/compactness, thereby resulting in a lower exclusion effect and an insufficient hydrodynamic volume. Besides, better radical scavenging activities in vitro were also determined for Gal-enriched BTP-A(11), where a larger surface area containing more H-donating groups were related to its higher Mw, more hyper-branched conformation, lower DM and higher DA. Therefore, the understanding of structure-property-activity relationships was improved to some degrees for acidic Biluochun Tea polysaccharides, which could be potentially required for more applications in food, medical and cosmetic fields.

AB  - Breast ultrasound (BUS) image classification in benign and malignant classes is often based on pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to cope with small-sized training data. Nevertheless, BUS images are single-channel gray-level images, whereas pre-trained CNNs learned from color images with red, green, and blue (RGB) components. Thus, a gray-to-color conversion method is applied to fit the BUS image to the CNN's input layer size. This paper evaluates 13 gray-to-color conversion methods proposed in the literature that follow three strategies: replicating the gray-level image to all RGB channels, decomposing the image to enhance inherent information like the lesion's texture and morphology, and learning a matching layer. Besides, we introduce an image decomposition method based on the lesion's structural information to describe its inner and outer complexity. These gray-to-color conversion methods are evaluated under the same experimental framework using a pre-trained CNN architecture named ResNet-18 and a BUS dataset with more than 3000 images. In addition, the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), sensitivity (SEN), and specificity (SPE) measure the classification performance. The experimental results show that decomposition methods outperform replication and learning-based methods when using information from the lesion's binary mask (obtained from a segmentation method), reaching an MCC value greater than 0.70 and specificity up to 0.92, although the sensitivity is about 0.80. On the other hand, regarding the proposed method, the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity is better balanced, obtaining about 0.88 for both indices and an MCC of 0.73. This study contributes to the objective assessment of different gray-to-color conversion approaches in classifying breast lesions, revealing that mask-based decomposition methods improve classification performance. Besides, the proposed method based on structural information improves the sensitivity, obtaining more reliable classification results on malignant cases and potentially benefiting clinical practice.

AB  - Simple Summary Developing sustainable livestock management requires knowledge and monitoring of which habitats within an enclosure the livestock prefers to stay in and in what way they utilise the available habitats. The technology of virtual fencing provides the ability to both monitor and adapt enclosures, thus adding value to the expense related to fencing for farmers and livestock managers. To this end, the possibilities this new technology offers need to be explored and methods developed. In this paper, we explore the monitoring capabilities of virtual fencing technology on a herd of cattle in a coastal dune landscape. We explore to what extent a herd of cattle prefers some habitats over others, and in what way they utilise each of the available habitats. We find clear differences in the amount of time the herd spends in each habitat and in the ways they utilise each habitat. The herd spend a disproportionately large amount of time in salt meadow, and likely spend most of their time there resting and ruminating. We conclude that the method for monitoring of cattle applied in this study, using existing virtual fencing technology, is a relatively precise method useful in year-round monitoring, with room for improvement.Abstract There has been an increased focus on new technologies to monitor habitat use and behaviour of cattle to develop a more sustainable livestock grazing system without compromising animal welfare. One of the currently used methods for monitoring cattle behaviour is tri-axial accelerometer data from systems such as virtual fencing technology or bespoke monitoring technology. Collection and transmission of high-frequency accelerometer and GNSS data is a major energy cost, and quickly drains the battery in contemporary virtual fencing systems, making it unsuitable for long-term monitoring. In this paper, we explore the possibility of determining habitat preference and habitat utilisation patterns in cattle using low-frequency activity and location data. We achieve this by (1) calculating habitat selection ratios, (2) determining daily activity patterns, and (3) based on those, inferring grazing and resting sites in a group of cattle wearing virtual fencing collars in a coastal setting with grey, wooded, and decalcified dunes, humid dune slacks, and salt meadows. We found that GNSS data, and a measure of activity, combined with accurate mapping of habitats can be an effective tool in assessing habitat preference. The animals preferred salt meadows over the other habitats, with wooded dunes and humid dune slacks being the least preferred. We were able to identify daily patterns in activity. By comparing general trends in activity levels to the existing literature, and using a Gaussian mixture model, it was possible to infer resting and grazing behaviour in the different habitats. According to our inference of behaviour the herd predominantly used the salt meadows for resting and ruminating. The approach used in this study allowed us to use GNSS location data and activity data and combine it with accurate habitat mapping to assess habitat preference and habitat utilisation patterns, which can be an important tool for guiding management decisions.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by cognitive inflexibility and social deficits, with a notably limited range of brain-targeted medications, particularly in the field of nanomedicine. Herein, we introduce the brain-targeted H2S donor cross-linked nanomicelle, named mannose-PEG600-lipoic acid (Man-LA). Man-LA demonstrates enhanced stability and precise brain delivery by interacting with glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) in astrocytes, facilitating a gradual release of H2S that is modulated by glutathione (GSH). In vivo, studies suggest that Man-LA alleviates symptoms of ASD, correlating with increased expression of aerobic glycolysis enzymes, elevated lactate production, and higher H2S levels, while preventing damage to hippocampal neurons. In vitro, Man-LA tightly binds to aldehyde dehydrogenase family 3 member B1 (Aldh3b1) in astrocytes, upregulating its expression. This interaction promotes aerobic glycolysis and enhances lactate production. These findings suggest a connection between ASD deficits and the dysregulation of astrocytic aerobic glycolysis, underscoring the role of H2S. Identifying the Aldh3b1 gene within aerobic glycolysis pathways provides a promising target for ASD treatment.

AB  - Simple Summary; Virtual fencing is a new way of enclosing livestock without the use of physical barriers. The system relies on GPS technology and works by deterring escapes using auditory warnings and electric impulses. This study examines the effectiveness of one such system in a rotational strip grazing regime with 17 Angus bull calves. This study also aimed to determine which bull calves were more likely to receive electric impulses. The system proved effective at containing the bull calves within the designated enclosure. The bull calves learned to associate the auditory warning with the electric impulse, and as such, received increasingly fewer impulses as time went on. However, in accordance with previous studies, there were clear differences in the number of warnings and impulses received between individuals. The results regarding which bull calves received the most impulses did not show any clear trends. In conclusion, the virtual fencing system proved to be effective and the animals learnt how to interact with the system while receiving very few impulses. Large grazers are essential for nature conservation. In order to prevent grazers from moving to unintended areas, it may be necessary to keep them inside enclosures. Physical fences present a number of problems, such as fragmenting the landscape. Virtual fencing, however, is a possible replacement for physical fencing, making it possible to enclose grazers without physical boundaries. Virtual fencing systems utilise collars with GPS technology to track animals and deliver auditory warnings and electric impulses to keep animals within predefined boundaries. This study examines how effective the virtual fencing system Nofence (c) is at enclosing calves in a holistically managed setting. Holistic management is a rotational grazing technique where an enclosure is grazed in small strips at a time. It is investigated whether the calves become habituated to the virtual fence and whether there is a correlation between the number of warnings received by every two calves in order to explore potential herd behaviour. Finally, this study examines which calves interact the most with the virtual fence by investigating the relationship between physical activity and number of interactions. Seventeen calves were fitted with a GPS collar from the company Nofence (c) and placed in a holistically managed enclosure. Data were gathered from 4 July to 30 September 2022. The study found that virtual fence was able to contain calves inside the designated enclosure, and over time the calves received notably fewer electrical impulses compared to auditory warnings. The results of Pearson's correlation between auditory warnings received by two random calves were inconclusive, but the use of a sliding window analysis should be further explored. Lastly, the most physically active animals were the ones who received the most auditory warnings, but they did not receive more impulses. No significant correlation was found between the number of electric impulses received and the physical activity of the animals.

AB  - Background Maturation is a process that allows synapses to acquire full functionality, optimizing their activity to diverse neural circuits, and defects in synaptic maturation may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders. Neuroligin-1 (NL1) is a postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule essential for synapse maturation, a role typically attributed to binding to pre-synaptic ligands, the neurexins. However, the pathways underlying the action of NL1 in synaptic maturation are incompletely understood, and some of its previously observed effects seem reminiscent of those described for the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Here, we show that maturational increases in active zone stability and synaptic vesicle recycling rely on the joint action of NL1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Results Applying BDNF to hippocampal neurons in primary cultures or organotypical slice cultures mimicked the effects of overexpressing NL1 on both structural and functional maturation. Overexpressing a NL1 mutant deficient in neurexin binding still induced presynaptic maturation. Like NL1, BDNF increased synaptic vesicle recycling and the augmentation of transmitter release by phorbol esters, both hallmarks of presynaptic maturation. Mimicking the effects of NL1, BDNF also increased the half-life of the active zone marker bassoon at synapses, reflecting increased active zone stability. Overexpressing NL1 increased the expression and synaptic accumulation of BDNF. Inhibiting BDNF signaling pharmacologically or genetically prevented the effects of NL1 on presynaptic maturation. Applying BDNF to NL1-knockout mouse cultures rescued defective presynaptic maturation, indicating that BDNF acts downstream of NL1 and can restore presynaptic maturation at late stages of network development. Conclusions Our data introduce BDNF as a novel and essential component in a transsynaptic pathway linking NL1-mediated cell adhesion, neurotrophin action, and presynaptic maturation. Our findings connect synaptic cell adhesion and neurotrophin signaling and may provide a therapeutic approach to neurodevelopmental disorders by targeting synapse maturation.

AB  - Cell proliferation is a central process in tissue development, homeostasis, and disease, yet how proliferation is regulated in the tissue context remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce a quantitative framework to elucidate how tissue growth dynamics regulate cell proliferation. Using MDCK epithelial monolayers, we show that a limiting rate of tissue expansion creates confinement that suppresses cell growth; however, this confinement does not directly affect the cell cycle. This leads to uncoupling between rates of cell growth and division in epithelia and, thereby, reduces cell volume. Division becomes arrested at a minimal cell volume, which is consistent across diverse epithelia in vivo. Here, the nucleus approaches the minimum volume capable of packaging the genome. Loss of cyclin D1-dependent cell-volume regulation results in an abnormally high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic volume ratio and DNA damage. Overall, we demonstrate how epithelial proliferation is regulated by the interplay between tissue confinement and cell-volume regulation.

AB  - The biomechanical phenotype of soft tissues - i.e., the sum of spatially- and directionally-varying mechanical properties - is a critical marker of tissue health and disease. While biomechanical phenotyping is always challenging, it is particularly difficult with minuscule tissues. For example, tissues from small animal models are often only millimeters in size, which prevents the use of traditional test methods, such as uniaxial tensile testing. To overcome this challenge, our current work describes and tests a novel experimental and numerical pipeline. First, we introduce a micro-bulge test device with which we pressurize and inflate minuscule soft tissues. We combine this microbulge device with an optical coherence tomography device to also image the samples during inflation. Based on pressure data and images we then perform inverse finite element simulations to identify our tissues' unknown material parameters. For validation, we identify the material parameters of a thin sheet of latex rubber via both uniaxial tensile testing and via our novel pipeline. Next, we demonstrate our pipeline against anterior tricuspid valve leaflets from rats. The resulting material parameters for these tissues compare excellently with data collected in sheep via standard planar biaxial testing. Additionally, we show that our device is compatible with other imaging modalities such as 2-Photon microscopy. To this end, we image the in-situ microstructural changes of the leaflets during inflation using second-harmonic generation imaging. In summary, we introduce a novel pipeline to biomechanically phenotype minuscule soft tissues and demonstrate its value by phenotyping the biomechanics of the anterior tricuspid valve leaflets from rats.

AB  - Calcitonin is a 32-amino acid peptide, which causes a decrease in blood calcium levels and bone resorption in the human body. It is produced in different species. Salmon calcitonin is used as a medicine for diseases such as osteoporosis, Paget's disease, and hypercalcemia. However, the salmon calcitonin peptide used as a medicine, could induce immune responses in humans. Decreasing the antigenicity of salmon calcitonin could improve this molecule for pharmaceutical usage. In this study, improving physicochemical properties and reducing allergenicity and especially the antigenicity of salmon calcitonin were followed. The calcitonin sequences of different species were evaluated, and those with better properties were considered as a guide for peptide engineering. In silico methods were utilized to characterize the properties of the reviewed calcitonin sequences, and the best sequences (the calcitonin of sheep, dog, rat, and human) were used as a template to decrease the antigenicity of salmon calcitonin. The epitopic parts, i.e., amino acids 16 to 29, were identified by different servers. Hot spot residues including Y22, N26, T27, and S29 were characterized based on the main criteria of being a B-cell epitope including convexity index, hydrophilicity, and surface accessibility. These residues were replaced with lower antigenic counterparts. Results showed the final selected mutant (T27V/S29V) had a lower antigenicity and higher solubility and stability than salmon calcitonin. Thus, our suggested mutant could be a potential alternative candidate to salmon calcitonin. However, future in vitro and in vivo evaluations are needed to confirm its suitability for clinical usage.

AB  - The Lomas formations are ephemeral seasonal oases found along the Pacific arid coast of South America. Whereas fast-growing plants are characteristic in the Lomas, other organisms such as land snails are also conspicuous. In the Lomas, several snails can occur sympatrically and therefore they might have adapted their food requirements to the limited available items while avoiding competing for food (resource partitioning). Since the dietary items and food preferences of Lomas' snails are almost completely unknown, our study aimed to document these in three snails occurring sympatrically, two native (Succinea peruviana and Bostryx conspersus) and one introduced (Cornu aspersum) species in Lomas de Lucumo, a threatened Lomas from Central Peru. We recorded the snails' activity, host, and food items. We also carried out dual-choice bioassays to evaluate the feeding preferences of B. conspersus and C. aspersum when offered leaf disks of the two dominant plant Lomas species, Senecio abadianus and Sicyos baderoa. Whereas we were unable to record any food item used by C. aspersum, we recorded the two native Lomas species (B. conspersus and S. peruviana) having contrasting patterns of feeding as they were on different hosts (plants vs soil) and food items (vascular plants vs. lichens/ organic material/mosses/algae). Although the feeding preferences were similar between B. conspersus and C. aspersum (i.e., both species preferred the leaves of Si. baderoa over Se. abadianus), C. aspersum, after feeding stimulation, consumed significantly less leaf area of Se. abadianus than B. conspersus. Sicyos individuals are fastgrowing plants and might be less herbivore-resistant, while Senecio species are characterized to produce defensive alkaloids which make plants less palatable. Our results indicate that Lomas' snail species have evolved distinct trophic niches by partitioning the limited food resources and native herbivorous species are better adapted to feed on Lomas' native plants given their common evolutionary history.

AB  - Introduction Gastrointestinal (GI) in vitro models have received lasting attention as an effective tool to model drug and nutrient absorption, study GI diseases, and design new drug delivery vehicles. A complete model of the GI epithelium should at a minimum include the two key functional components of the GI tract: mucus and the underlying epithelium. Mucus plays a key role in protecting and lubricating the GI tract, poses a barrier to orally administered therapies and pathogens, and serves as the microenvironment for the GI microbiome. These functions are reliant on the biophysical material properties of the mucus produced, including viscosity and pore size. Methods In this study, we generated in vitro models containing Caco-2 enterocyte-like cells and HT29-MTX goblet-like cells and determined the effects of coculture and mucus layer on epithelial permeability and biophysical properties of mucus using multiple particle tracking (MPT). Results We found that mucus height increased as the amount of HT29-MTX goblet-like cells increased. Additionally, we found that increasing the amount of HT29-MTX goblet-like cells within culture corresponded to an increase in mucus pore size and mucus microviscosity, measured using MPT. When compared to ex vivo mucus samples from mice and pigs, we found that a 90:10 ratio of Caco-2:HT29-MTX coculture displayed similar mucus pore size to porcine jejunum and that the mucus produced from 90:10 and 80:20 ratios of cells shared mechanical properties to porcine jejunum and ileum mucus. Conclusions GI coculture models are valuable tools in simulating the mucus barrier and can be utilized for a variety of applications including the study of GI diseases, food absorption, or therapeutic development.

AB  - Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) is a common malignant tumor of digestive tract, accounting for 90% of all pathological types of esophageal cancer. Despite the rapid development of multi-disciplinary treatment such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy, the prognosis of patients with ESCC is still poor. Regulators of G-protein signaling (RGSs) are involved in the processes of various cancers. The expression levels of its family member RGS16 are abnormally elevated in a variety of tumors, but its role in ESCC is still unclear. We found that RGS16 expression is aberrantly increased in ESCC tissues and correlated with poor prognosis of ESCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and our collected ESCC tissues. Moreover, knockdown of RGS16 in two ESCC cells could indeed inhibit their proliferation and migration. We further explored the molecular mechanism of RGS16 in ESCC, and the correlation analysis from TCGA database showed that the mRNA levels of RGS16 was positively correlated with that of CTGF and CYR61, two target genes of Hippo-YAP signaling. Consistently, RGS16-knockdown significantly inhibited the expression of CTGF and CYR61 in ESCC cells. We found that the phosphorylation levels of LATS1 and YAP were significantly increased and YAP translocated into the cytoplasm after depletion of RGS16 in ESCC cells. Also, RGS16-knockdown promoted the interaction between LATS1 and upstream kinase MST1. In addition, reintroduction of a constitutive active YAP5A mutant significantly rescued CTGF expression and cell proliferation in RGS16-knockdown cells. Together, our work revealed that RGS16 promoted YAP activity through disrupting the interaction between LATS1 and MST1, thus promoting the proliferation and migration of ESCC cells.

AB  - The hippocampal subfields, pivotal to episodic memory, are distinct both in terms of cyto- and myeloarchitectony. Studying the structure of hippocampal subfields in vivo is crucial to understand volumetric trajectories across the lifespan, from the emergence of episodic memory during early childhood to memory impairments found in older adults. However, segmenting hippocampal subfields on conventional MRI sequences is challenging because of their small size. Furthermore, there is to date no unified segmentation protocol for the hippocampal subfields, which limits comparisons between studies. Therefore, we introduced a novel segmentation tool called HSF short for hippocampal segmentation factory, which leverages an end-to-end deep learning pipeline. First, we validated HSF against currently used tools (ASHS, HIPS, and HippUnfold). Then, we used HSF on 3,750 subjects from the HCP development, young adults, and aging datasets to study the effect of age and sex on hippocampal subfields volumes. Firstly, we showed HSF to be closer to manual segmentation than other currently used tools (p < 0.001), regarding the Dice Coefficient, Hausdorff Distance, and Volumetric Similarity. Then, we showed differential maturation and aging across subfields, with the dentate gyrus being the most affected by age. We also found faster growth and decay in men than in women for most hippocampal subfields. Thus, while we introduced a new, fast and robust end-to-end segmentation tool, our neuroanatomical results concerning the lifespan trajectories of the hippocampal subfields reconcile previous conflicting results.

AB  - Aversive Geofencing Devices (AGDs) are designed to emit audible warning signals followed by electric shocks when animals reach virtual fences (VFs) with the intent that animals will learn to turn away at audio warnings and thereby avoid receiving shocks. AGDs are a potentially useful tool for mitigating human-elephant conflict, but a greater understanding of captive elephant responses to AGDs is required before they might be confidently used on wild elephants. We conducted experiments with eight, female captive Asian elephants using a modified dog-training collar to deliver mild electric shocks (4 kV) of varying strength (pulse frequencies) to determine the ideal location on the neck to deliver the stimuli and the optimum strength of the shock required to generate desired aversive responses. Ten shocks (<1 s duration) of different strengths were delivered during a 10 min session (i.e., one shock per minute) at two positions on one side of the elephant's neck. Results indicated that elephants were more likely to display desirable aversive behaviours at the upper position tested on the neck (odds ratio=0.47, 95% CI 0.25-0.87, P = 0.018) and at higher stimuli strengths (odds ratio=1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.04, P <= 0.001). A conditioning experiment was then conducted several months later with five of the same elephants. These were individually trained to walk along a similar to 100 m path to a food reward on three consecutive days, wearing a dummy collar. On the next three days and on one other day few months later, the elephants were fitted with a similar shock collar (positioned at the upper neck location, and with the highest strength tested earlier) to determine if the AGD could prevent the elephants from accessing the food reward. Three VFs were established at similar to 30 m, similar to 50 m and similar to 60 m points along the path. As the elephant approached the food, a mild audio warning, a more aggressive audio warning, and an electric shock was administered at the first, second and third VFs respectively. Warnings and shocks were not delivered if elephants heeded earlier warnings. A maximum of five such trials were attempted. The VFs successfully kept elephants from reaching the food 77.8% of the time, with elephants responding to the audio warnings and avoiding electric stimulation 47.2% of the trials. These findings suggest that AGDs are a promising method to manage elephant movement, but further research is needed to develop a reliable approach for wild elephants.

KW  - WHALE OPTIMIZATION
AB  - In recent years, scholars have developed and enhanced optimization algorithms to tackle high-dimensional optimization and engineering challenges. The primary challenge of high-dimensional optimization lies in striking a balance between exploring a wide search space and focusing on specific regions. Meanwhile, engineering design problems are intricate and come with various constraints. This research introduces a novel approach called Hippo Swarm Optimization (HSO), inspired by the behavior of hippos, designed to address high-dimensional optimization problems and real-world engineering challenges. HSO encompasses four distinct search strategies based on the behavior of hippos in different scenarios: starvation search, alpha search, margination, and competition. To assess the effectiveness of HSO, we conducted experiments using the CEC2017 test set, featuring the highest dimensional problems, CEC2022 and four constrained engineering problems. In parallel, we employed 14 established optimization algorithms as a control group. The experimental outcomes reveal that HSO outperforms the 14 well-known optimization algorithms, achieving first average ranking out of them in CEC2017 and CEC2022. Across the four classical engineering design problems, HSO consistently delivers the best results. These results substantiate HSO as a highly effective optimization algorithm for both high-dimensional optimization and engineering challenges.

AB  - Introduction: Epidemiological studies indicated that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as its two main types, is associated with dementia. However, little is known about how adolescents with IBD will affect their cognitive ability as adults. The hippocampus, which is crucial for memory and adult neurogenesis, is closely associated with modulation of cognitive processes. Using a low kDa dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, 5 kDa)-induced chronic colitis (mild chronic colitis) mice model in adolescent mice, we investigated the effects of mild chronic colitis on cognitive functions and hippocampal neurogenesis from adolescent mice to adult mice. Methods: We induced DSS-induced mild chronic colitis in C57BL/6J male mice by multiple-cycle administration of 1%-2% DSS in autoclaved drinking water. Mice were subjected to novel-object recognition and Y-maze tests. Neurogenesis markers and neuroinflammation-related proteins in the hippocampus of mice were measured. Tight junction proteins in the colon of mice were measured. Results: Mild chronic colitis induced cognitive impairment and decreased adult neurogenesis. Notably, we found a positive correlation with the protein levels between tight junction protein, ZO-1, in the colon and mature neuron marker, NeuN, in the hippocampus. Moreover, mild chronic colitis leads to hippo-campal neuroinflammation in adolescent mice. Conclusion: Our findings provide new evidence of the association between IBD and dementia risk.

AB  - Introduction: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plays a role in innate immunity and is used in animal models of maternal immune activation. The current study attempted to clarify the effect of LPS exposure on the dentate gyrus progenitors in ferret neonates. Methods: LPS was administered subcutaneously at 500 mu g/g of body weight to ferrets on postnatal days 6 and 7. Animals were injected intraperitonially with BrdU simultaneously with a second LPS injection to label the proliferating cells following LPS exposure. Results: Two hours after BrdU injection, a significantly greater density of BrdU-labeled cells was observed in the hilus of the hippocampal dentate gyrus in LPS-exposed ferrets than in that of the controls. The majority of BrdU-labeled cells were Sox2 immunopositive in either the granular/subgranular layers or hilus in both groups. The percentages of BLBP (a marker of adult-type dentate gyrus progenitors), S100 (a marker of glial cells), and cleaved caspase 3 (a marker of apoptosis) were significantly lower in the granular/subgranular layers and/or hilus of LPS-exposed ferrets than in those of the controls. Conclusions: These findings suggest that LPS promotes the proliferation of dentate gyrus progenitors. LPS may further act on the post-proliferative dentate gyrus progenitors to sustain their embryonic-type characteristics by preventing their transitions into the BLBP-expressing adult-type and/or S100-expressing glial cell lineages and by inhibiting programmed cell death.

AB  - Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann) (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae) is a subterranean termite species from Southeast Asia which has been unintentionally introduced to many parts of the world through commerce and modern transportation. Known for causing extensive damage to timber used in the built environment, the termite also has a habit of nesting in carton nests in wood and wooden structures in buildings. As so little is known of its breeding system, colony, and genetic structure, we initiated work to sequence its genome with an Illumina HiSeq (TM) 2000 sequencer. In this publication, we announce our paired-end sequencing data and report the isolation of 119,190 microsatellite markers from our DNA assembly. The microsatellite marker reported in this publication can be used to elucidate the mating system and genetic structure of this highly invasive termite species. Additionally, in this announcement the study authors make the Bio Project sequence accession number SRR13105492 accessible from the Sequence Read Archive database.

AB  - Red blood cell (RBC)-hitchhiking, in which different nanocarriers (NCs) shuttle on the erythrocyte membrane and disassociate from RBCs to the first organ downstream of the intravenous injection spot, has recently been introduced as a solution to enhance target site uptake. Several experimental studies have already approved that cellular hitchhiking onto the RBC membrane can improve the delivery of a wide range of NCs in mice, pigs, and ex vivo human lungs. In these studies, the impact of NC size, NC surface chemistry, and shear rate on the delivery process and biodistribution has been widely explored. To shed light on the underlying physics in this type of drug delivery system, we present a computational platform in the context of the lattice Boltzmann method, spring connected network, and frictional immersed boundary method. The proposed algorithm simulates nanoparticle (NP) dislodgment from the RBC surface in shear flow and biomimetic microfluidic channels. The numerical simulations are performed for various NP sizes and RBC-NP adhesion strengths. In shear flow, NP detachment increases upon increasing the shear rate. RBC-RBC interaction can also significantly boost shear-induced particle detachment. Larger NPs have a higher propensity to be disconnected from the RBC surface. The results illustrate that changing the interaction between the NPs and RBCs can control the desorption process. All the findings agree with in vivo and in vitro experimental observations. We believe that the proposed setup can be exploited as a predictive tool to estimate optimum parameters in NP-bound RBCs for better targeting procedures in tissue microvasculature.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Regional gray matter (GM) alterations have been reported in early-onset psychosis (EOP, onset before age 18), but previous studies have yielded conflicting results, likely due to small sample sizes and the different brain regions examined. In this study, we conducted a whole brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis in a large sample of individuals with EOP, using the newly developed ENIGMA-VBM tool.
   METHODS: 15 independent cohorts from the ENIGMA-EOP working group participated in the study. The overall sample comprised T1-weighted MRI data from 482 individuals with EOP and 469 healthy controls. Each site performed the VBM analysis locally using the standardized ENIGMA-VBM tool. Statistical parametric T-maps were generated from each cohort and meta-analyzed to reveal voxel-wise differences between EOP and healthy controls as well as the individual-based association between GM volume and age of onset, chlorpromazine (CPZ) equivalent dose, and other clinical variables.
   RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, individuals with EOP showed widespread lower GM volume encompassing most of the cortex, with the most marked effect in the left median cingulate (Hedges' g = 0.55, p = 0.001 corrected), as well as small clusters of lower white matter (WM), whereas no regional GM or WM volumes were higher in EOP. Lower GM volume in the cerebellum, thalamus and left inferior parietal gyrus was associated with older age of onset. Deficits in GM in the left inferior frontal gyrus, right insula, right precentral gyrus and right superior frontal gyrus were also associated with higher CPZ equivalent doses.
   CONCLUSION: EOP is associated with widespread reductions in cortical GM volume, while WM is affected to a smaller extent. GM volume alterations are associated with age of onset and CPZ equivalent dose but these effects are small compared to case-control differences. Mapping anatomical abnormalities in EOP may lead to a better understanding of the role of psychosis in brain development during childhood and adolescence.

AB  - The aim of this research was to determine the factors affecting the metallurgical quality of cast iron during serial production of castings using a campaign cupola and a holding furnace. The problem to be solved, which was to obtain cast iron with the required mechanical properties while reducing the internal porosity, results from the foundry's need to increase the metallurgical quality of the alloy. The increasing difficulty and complicated constructions of castings, for which it is not possible to introduce risers at the stage of technological design, make the stage of proper preparation of cast iron the only way to obtain castings without shrinkage defects. The article presents the results of the study of physicochemical and mechanical properties, microstructure and shrinkage tendency of ductile iron depending on the charge materials used, the amount of Mg used during spheroidization and the type of final inoculants. Step castings and wedge tests were produced on a vertical molding line. The spheroidization was carried out by injecting a core wire containing Mg alloy into the cast iron. The final inoculation of 0.2% was performed using a pneumatic dispenser equipped with a vision system to control the effectiveness of the inoculation. The ITACA Meltdeck thermal analysis system was used to study the physicochemical properties of the initial cast iron, and the ITACA X system to analyze the state of the final cast iron on the molding line. Mechanical tests were performed on samples cut from a stepped casting, and microstructure tests were carried out using a light microscope and a scanning electron microscope. The results of thermal analyses show that increasing the share of pig iron at the expense of steel increases the minimum solidification temperature of eutectic, and thus, increases the potential for graphite nucleation in cast iron. Increasing the nucleation potential can be obtained by adding anthracite, FeSi and SiC. A very important factor in obtaining cast iron of high metallurgical quality is the possible limitation during spheroidization of the length of the core wire containing Mg, which is a carbide-forming element. The lower the initial sulfur level, the greater the possibility of reducing the amount of cored wire. The inoculants containing Ce and Bi were the most advantageous final inoculants from the point of view of obtaining the best microstructure parameters and plastic properties of cast iron.

AB  - The combination of natural products with standard chemotherapeutic agents offers a promising strategy to enhance the efficacy or reduce the side effects of standard chemotherapy. Doxorubicin (DOX), a standard drug for breast cancer, has several disadvantages, including severe side effects and the development of drug resistance. Recently, we reported the potential bioactive markers of Australian propolis extract (AP-1) and their broad spectrum of pharmacological activities. In the present study, we explored the synergistic interactions between AP-1 and DOX in the MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells using different synergy quantitation models. Biochemometric and metabolomics-driven analysis was performed to identify the potential anticancer metabolites in AP-1. The molecular mechanisms of synergy were studied by analysing the apoptotic profile via flow cytometry, apoptotic proteome array and measuring the oxidative status of the MCF7 cells treated with the most synergistic combination. Furthermore, label-free quantification proteomics analysis was performed to decipher the underlying synergistic mechanisms. Five prenylated stilbenes were identified as the key metabolites in the most active AP-1 fraction. Strong synergy was observed when AP-1 was combined with DOX in the ratio of 100:0.29 (w/w) as validated by different synergy quantitation models implemented. AP-1 significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of DOX against MCF7 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner with significant inhibition of the reactive oxygen species (p < 0.0001) compared to DOX alone. AP-1 enabled the reversal of DOX-mediated necrosis to programmed cell death, which may be advantageous to decline DOX-related side effects. AP-1 also significantly enhanced the apoptotic effect of DOX after 24 h of treatment with significant upregulation of catalase, HTRA2/Omi, FADD together with DR5 and DR4 TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (p < 0.05), contributing to the antiproliferative activity of AP-1. Significant upregulation of pro-apoptotic p27, PON2 and catalase with downregulated anti-apoptotic XIAP, HSP60 and HIF-1 alpha, and increased antioxidant proteins (catalase and PON2) may be associated with the improved apoptosis and oxidative status of the synergistic combination-treated MCF7 cells compared to the mono treatments. Shotgun proteomics identified 21 significantly dysregulated proteins in the synergistic combination-treated cells versus the mono treatments. These proteins were involved in the TP53/ATM-regulated non-homologous end-joining pathway and double-strand breaks repairs, recruiting the overexpressed BRCA1 and suppressed RIF1 encoded proteins. The overexpression of UPF2 was noticed in the synergistic combination treatment, which could assist in overcoming doxorubicin resistance-associated long non-coding RNA and metastasis of the MCF7 cells. In conclusion, we identified the significant synergy and highlighted the key molecular pathways in the interaction between AP-1 and DOX in the MCF7 cells together with the AP-1 anticancer metabolites. Further in vivo and clinical studies are warranted on this synergistic combination.

KW  - PERFORMANCE
KW  - STRENGTH
AB  - Introducing dynamics into bio-based adhesives shows many advantages on rendering mechanics and functions. However, the efficient employment of dynamic chemistry in achieving robust, stable, and reusable bio-based adhesives derived from low-value residues remains elusive. Here, we facilely develop a reused camellia meal-based adhesive integrating excellent mechanical robustness, environment durability, and mildew resistance through the cooperation of dual dynamic bonds. By deliberately harnessing dynamic covalent bonds as the first strong interlinking and dynamic noncovalent bonds as the second weak interaction, our strategy allows the resulting adhesive with a much-improved adhesion strength (2.1/1.06 MPa to wood in dry/wet condition) and remarkable adhesion maintenance against harsh environmental factors (organic solvents, salt, acid, alkali, temperature, soaking time). By virtue of these abundant dynamic bonds, this adhesive not only escapes from the inherent drawback of biomaterials to display enlarged anti-mildew efficacy, but also is capable of reprocessing to gain reusability. Combining these desirous characters with the simple two-step fabrication process, this study provides a great potential for the development of high-performance bio-based adhesives sustainably and intelligently.

AB  - Introduction The effectiveness of neural interfacing devices depends on the anatomical and physiological properties of the target region. Multielectrode arrays, used for neural recording and stimulation, are influenced by electrode placement and stimulation parameters, which critically impact tissue response. This study presents a multiscale computational model that predicts responses of neurons in the hippocampus-a key brain structure primarily involved in memory formation, especially the conversion of short-term memories into long-term storage-to extracellular electrical stimulation, providing insights into the effects of electrode positioning and stimulation strategies on neuronal response.Methods We modeled the rat hippocampus with highly detailed axonal projections, integrating the Admittance Method to model propagation of the electric field in the tissue with the NEURON simulation platform. The resulting model simulates electric fields generated by virtual electrodes in the perforant path of entorhinal cortical (EC) axons projecting to the dentate gyrus (DG) and predicts DG granule cell activation via synaptic inputs.Results We determined stimulation amplitude thresholds required for granule cell activation at different electrode placements along the perforant path. Membrane potential changes during synaptic activation were validated against experimental recordings. Additionally, we assessed the effects of bipolar electrode placements and stimulation amplitudes on direct and indirect activation.Conclusion Stimulation amplitudes above 750 mu A consistently activate DG granule cells. Lower stimulation amplitudes are required for axonal activation and downstream synaptic transmission when electrodes are placed in the molecular layer, infra-pyramidal region, and DG crest.Significance The study and underlying methodology provide useful insights to guide the stimulation protocol required to activate DG granule cells following the stimulation of EC axons; the complete realistic 3D model presented constitutes an invaluable tool to strengthen our understanding of hippocampal response to electrical stimulation and guide the development and placement of prospective stimulation devices and strategies.

AB  - BackgroundThe diarylheptanoid ASPP 049 has improved the quality of adult hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) expansion ex vivo through long-term reconstitution in animal models. However, its effect on hematopoietic regeneration from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is unknown.MethodWe utilized a defined cocktail of cytokines without serum or feeder followed by the supplementation of ASPP 049 to produce hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Flow cytometry and trypan blue exclusion analysis were used to identify nonadherent and adherent cells. Nonadherent cells were harvested to investigate the effect of ASPP 049 on multipotency using LTC-IC and CFU assays. Subsequently, the mechanism of action was explored through transcriptomic profiles, which were validated by qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence analysis.ResultThe supplementation of ASPP 049 increased the number of phenotypically defined primitive HSPCs (CD34+CD45+CD90+) two-fold relative to seeded hiPSC colonies, indicating enhanced HSC derivation from hiPSCs. Under ASPP 049-supplemented conditions, we observed elevated HSPC niches, including CD144+CD73- hemogenic- and CD144+CD73+ vascular-endothelial progenitors, during HSC differentiation. Moreover, harvested ASPP 049-treated cells exhibited improved self-renewal and a significantly larger proportion of different blood cell colonies with unbiased lineages, indicating enhanced HSC stemness properties. Transcriptomics and KEGG analysis of sorted CD34+CD45+ cells-related mRNA profiles revealed that the Hippo signaling pathway is the most significant in responding to WWTR1/TAZ, which correlates with the validation of the protein expression. Interestingly, ASPP 049-supplemented HSPCs upregulated 11 genes similarly to umbilical cord blood-derived HSPCs.ConclusionThese findings suggest that ASPP 049 can improve HSC-generating protocols with proliferative potentials, self-renewal ability, unbiased differentiation, and a definable mechanism of action for the clinical perspective of hematopoietic regenerative medicine.

AB  - The ability to measure changes in neural activities using devices implanted in the brain can be useful for recording brain signals to assess specific risk factors, monitor the development of brain diseases, and expand the understanding of neural circuitry. Here, a neuroimplantable interface is introduced that integrates biomaterials with an advanced structural design to facilitate monitoring of electrophysiological responses in widespread brain regions. The neural interface uses biocompatible and photopatternable materials to create ultrathin, homogeneous encapsulant/substrate laminates. Comprehensive in vitro tests of the laminin-enveloped neural interface demonstrate efficacy in relieving inflammation via a biomimetic strategy by diminishing microglia and astrocyte aggregation near recording sites, enhancing periodic signal acquisition. The performance is evaluated by injecting an acetylcholine receptor agonist into mouse brains. This approach enables to monitor real-time signal changes, gain insights into neural network dynamics by assessing stimulus-evoked signaling at specific sites, and identify signaling patterns and hippocampal synaptic connections. Additionally, in a Parkinson's disease mouse model, deep brain stimulation is performed and signals are recorded to confirm symptom amelioration, offering a biomedical device approach. The key strategy highlights intact neural electrodes with biocompatible, mechanically compliant materials conferring compact bioelectronic functionalities, high neuronal microenvironment compatibility, and pathological neural system recognition.

AB  - The majority of myxosporean species (Cnidaria: Myxozoa) of the genera Myxobolus (35 species), Henneguya (8 species), and Myxidium (9 species) from freshwater or brackish fish in Japan were recorded more than 30 years ago (accumulatively 81.1% [43/53]). The re-discovery and molecular-genetic characterization of these species is a current research priority. During our myxosporean survey in Japanese freshwater fish, we detected three species that had never been recorded in Japan, but in the Russian Far East (Sakhalin Island, and Maritime Province): Myxobolus tribolodonus sp. n., forming cysts in the gills of Tribolodon sachalinensis (syn. M. marinus sensu Aseeva, 2000; M. marinus sensu Sokolov et Frolova, 2015, recorded from the gills of Pseudaspius (syn. Tribolodon) spp.); Henneguya pungitii Achmerov, 1953, forming cysts in the subcutis of external skin and buccal submucosa of Pungitius sinensis; and Myxidium salvelini Konovalov et Shulman, 1966, in the urinary bladder of Oncorhynchus masou ishikawae. These new isolates were characterized by integrated taxonomic approaches, i.e., myxospore morphology and molecular-genetic characterization of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA). These new isolates were phylogenetically differentiated from any species whose SSU rDNA sequences were deposited in the DNA databases, and concurrently compared with recorded species based on classical morphological criteria. All three species were differentiated from myxosporeans previously recorded in Japan, indicating new distribution records out of the Russian Far East. For reliable species identification, accumulation of at least SSU rDNA sequences of known species worldwide is critically important.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, particularly in young people. Diffuse axonal injuries (DAI) are the result of strong rotational and translational forces on the brain parenchyma, leading to cerebral oedema and neuronal death. DAI is typically characterized by coma without focal lesions at presentation and is defined by localized axonal damage in multiple regions of the brain parenchyma, often causing impairment of cognitive and neuro-vegetative function. Following TBI, axonal degeneration has been identified as a progressive process that begins with the disruption of axonal transport, leading subsequently to axonal swelling, axonal ballooning, axonal retraction bulges, secondary disconnection and Wallerian degeneration. The objective of this paper is to report on a series of patients who have suffered fatal traumatic brain injury, in order to verify neurological outcomes in dynamics, relative to the time of injury, using antibodies for neurofilament (NFL), spectrin II, beta-amyloid (beta-APP), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68). From the studied cases, a total of 50 cases were chosen, which formed two study groups. The first study group comprises 30 cases divided according to survival interval. The control group comprises 20 cases with no history of traumatic brain injury. Cardiovascular disease and history of stroke, cases suffering from loss of vital functions, a post-traumatic survival time of less than 15 min, autolysis and putrefaction were established as criteria for exclusion. Based on their expression, we tested for diagnosis and degree of DAI as a strong predictor of mortality. Immunoreactivity was significantly increased in the DAI group compared to the control group. The earliest changes were recorded for GFAP and CD68 immunolabeling, followed by beta-APP, spectrin II and NFM. The most intense changes in immunostaining were recorded for spectrin II. Comparative analysis of brain apoptosis, reactive astrocytosis and inflammatory reaction using specific immunohistochemical markers can provide important information on diagnosis of DAI and prognosis, and may elucidate the timing of the traumatic event in traumatic brain injury.

AB  - <bold>Introduction:</bold> Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is characterized by stromal edema, albumin deposition, and pseudocyst formation. Anoikis, a process in which cells detach from the correct extracellular matrix, disrupts integrin junctions, thereby inhibiting improperly proliferating cells from growing or adhering to an inappropriate matrix. Although anoikis is implicated in immune regulation and CRSwNP pathogenesis, its specific mechanistic role remains poorly defined. <bold>Methods:</bold> The GSE136825 and GSE179625 datasets were obtained from the GEO database and 338 anoikis-related genes (ARGs) were extracted from the literature and databases. Immune cell infiltration was analysed using the CIBERSORT algorithm. CRSwNP samples were classified via consensus clustering. Key ARGs were identified through machine learning. The diagnostic performance of candidate genes was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Functional annotation was performed based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and pathway enrichment analysis was conducted using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. Regulatory networks were visualized using NetworkAnalyst and Cytoscape. Experimental validation included quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunofluorescence (IF) in human tissues. <bold>Results:</bold> Consensus clustering stratified CRSwNP patients into two distinct anoikis-related clusters. Machine learning identified four key genes: CDH3, PTHLH, PDCD4, and androgen receptor (AR). The nomogram model demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) >0.90. Immune infiltration analysis revealed differential immune microenvironments between clusters, with AR overexpressed in cluster 1 and PTHLH in cluster 2. Network analysis identified 862 drugs or compounds targeting AR. Experimental validation confirmed consistency between bioinformatics predictions and tissue-level expression patterns. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study delineates two anoikis-related molecular subtypes of CRSwNP and identifies AR and PTHLH as cluster-specific biomarkers. These findings provide novel insights for personalized therapy, drug screening, and immunomodulatory strategies in CRSwNP.

AB  - In view of the current situation of low visibility at night and increasing poaching activities in wildlife reserves, the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) monitoring equipped with thermal infrared (TIR) cameras has become a trend. To overcome the difficulties of small objects and low resolution in infrared images, this letter proposes a nonsalient object detection algorithm in infrared images based on deep learning. Based on Grid R-CNN, we designed a feature extraction network, improved the region proposal network by guided anchoring (GA-RPN), and introduced the slice inference mechanism. Our method makes the network selectively fuse multiscale features to generate high-quality proposals and improve detection accuracy. Experimental results show our method is superior to other object detection algorithms for nonsalient elephant images on the BIRDSAI dataset.

AB  - IntroductionHypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) can be a challenging clinical problem. It is not fully elucidated where in the circulation the regulation of resistance takes place. It is often referred to as if it is in the arteries, but we hypothesized that it is in the venous side of the pulmonary circulation.MethodsIn an open thorax model, pigs were treated with a veno-venous extra corporeal membrane oxygenator to either oxygenate or deoxygenate blood passing through the pulmonary vessels. At the same time the lungs were ventilated with extreme variations of inspired air from 5% to 100% oxygen, making it possible to make combinations of high and low oxygen content through the pulmonary circulation. A flow probe was inserted around the main pulmonary artery and catheters in the pulmonary artery and in the left atrium were used for pressure monitoring and blood tests. Under different combinations of oxygenation, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was calculated.ResultsWith unchanged level of oxygen in the pulmonary artery and reduced inspired oxygen fraction lowering oxygen tension from 29 to 6.7 kPa in the pulmonary vein, PVR was doubled. With more extreme hypoxia PVR suddenly decreased. Combinations with low oxygenation in the pulmonary artery did not systematic influence PVR if there was enough oxygen in the inspired air and in the pulmonary veins.DiscussionThe impact of hypoxia occurs from the alveolar level and forward with the blood flow. The experiments indicated that the regulation of PVR is mediated from the venous side.
   A ventilator and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) are used for improving oxygenation in the daily clinic, but experimentally they can be used to remove oxygen.image

AB  - Introduction: Aluminum is everywhere in nature and is a recognized neurotoxicant closely associated with various neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroinflammation occurs in the early stage of neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying mechanism by which aluminum induces neuroinflammation remains unclear. Material and methods: A 3-month subchronic aluminum exposure mouse model was established by drinking water containing aluminum chloride (AlCl3). Microglia BV2 cells and hippocampal neuron HT22 cells were treated with AlCl3 in vitro. BBG and YC-1 were used as intervention agents.Results: Aluminum could activate microglia and increase the level of extracellular ATP, stimulate P2X7 receptor, HIF-1 alpha, activate NLRP3 inflammasome and CASP-1, release more cytokine IL-1 beta, and induce an inflammatory response in nerve cells. There was a mutual regulatory relationship between P2X7 and HIF-1 alpha at mRNA and protein levels. The co-culture system of BV2-HT22 cells observed that conditioned medium from microglia treated with aluminum could aggravate neuronal morphological damage, inflammatory response and death. While BBG and YC-1 intervention could rescue these injuries to some extent.Conclusion: The P2X7-NLRP3 pathway was involved in aluminum-induced neuroinflammation and injury. P2X7 and HIF-1 alpha might mutually regulate and promote the progression of neuroinflammation, both BBG and YC-1 could relieve it.

AB  - IntroductionChronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is strongly associated with significant impairment of quality of life (QoL) in children. The SN-5 questionnaire is an important assessment tool for pediatric CRS. This study aimed to evaluate potential prognostic factors for treatment of pediatric CRS within the Hebrew version of the SN-5 questionnaire.MethodsA prospective study in pediatric otolaryngology unit. Patients were treated either surgically or pharmacologically. Following informed consent, parents of pediatric CRS patients completed the translated and validated Hebrew version (SN-5H) prior to treatment and after three months. We analyzed the results of both treatment arms according to success (achieving minimal clinically important difference; MCID).Results102 children aged 5-12 years and their caregivers participated (74 CRS patients and 28 controls without CRS). SN-5H items scores were significantly higher in CRS patients compared to controls (p < 0.001). Baseline activity scores were higher, while baseline emotional scores were lower in MCID( +) CRS patients, compared to MCID(-) CRS patients (p < 0.05). High emotional stress and low activity scores at baseline were associated with poorer odds to achieve MCID.ConclusionsThe SN-5H questionnaire is invaluable tool for assessing pediatric CRS patients. Psychosocial aspects of CRS significantly affect QoL and should be addressed in the office pre-treatment. The SN-5H can aid in highlighting patients in need for further reassurance and psychosocial support to manage expectations, and to improve QoL.

AB  - Introduction This study aims to examine the impact of Rukangyin (RKY) and its components, LSQR and QTSS, on various cellular processes and signaling mechanisms in MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells.Methods Twenty-five Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to five groups according to the administered drugs, including the RKY group, LSQR group, QTSS group, fluorouracil group, and blank control group (n=5 in each group). The serum samples from each group were then used as a medicated medium for the culture of the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. Cell viability tests, apoptosis detection tests, and migration and invasion tests were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of treated serum. YAP, TAZ, MST1, and LATS1 protein expression and phosphorylation were examined using conventional western blotting methods.Results RKY and its QTSS and LSQR components significantly inhibited cell growth and promoted apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. RKY also significantly blocked cell motility with a comparable effect to that of fluorouracil. All serum groups suppressed YAP and TAZ expressions while increasing p-YAP, p-TAZ, MST1, and LATS1 levels, with RKY showing superior efficacy.Discussion In TNBC cells, RKY appears to enhance the tumor-suppressing signals of the Hippo signaling pathway via MST1, LATS1 activation, while restricting its pro-oncogenic action via YAP and TAZ blockade. However, in vivo and animal model experiments are required to confirm these findings.Conclusion RKY-medicated serum effectively inhibits growth, induces apoptosis, and reduces motility in the MDA-MB-231 cell line of breast cancer. This therapeutic potential of RKY on TNBC cells draws attention to the need for more investigations.

AB  - Simple Summary Diseases caused by parasites have introduced serious threats to human health and the development of animal husbandry in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Area (QTPA), such as toxoplasmosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii and neosporosis caused by Neospora caninum. However, information on the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis and neosporosis in stray cats and dogs which are the definitive hosts of T. gondii and N. caninum in the QTPA is limited. The aim of this study was to establish a detailed record of the seroprevalence of T. gondii and N. caninum-specific IgG and IgM antibodies in serum samples and the molecular epidemiology in feces from stray cats and dogs in the plateau area. The results revealed that stray cats and dogs in the QTPA, China present both T. gondii and N. caninum infection through the antibodies and antigen detection of the indirect ELISA tests and qPCRs. The present study suggests the prevalence of acute neosporosis and chronic re-emergence of toxoplasmosis in stray cats and dogs in the testing area. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of T. gondii and N. caninum infection in cats and dogs in the QTPA, and the first determination of N. caninum infection in cats in China. In conclusion, stray cats and dogs play key roles in the transmission and prevalence of T. gondii and N. caninum in the plateau area. Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum belong to the Apicomplexan protozoa which is an obligate intracellular parasite, causing toxoplasmosis and neosporosis throughout the world. Cats and dogs are the definitive hosts of these two parasites. However, information on the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis and neosporosis in stray cats and dogs in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Area (QTPA) is limited, and little is known about the diversity of the diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform indirect ELISA tests based on recombinant TgSAG1, TgGRA1, NcSAG1 and NcGRA7 proteins to establish a detailed record of the seroprevalence of T. gondii and N. caninum-specific IgG and IgM antibodies in serum samples and to develop qPCR amplification based on TgB1 and NcNc5 genes to conduct molecular epidemiology in feces from stray cats and dogs in the QTPA. In the current study, a total of 128 cat serum samples were analyzed through serological tests in which 53 (41.4%) and 57 (44.5%) samples were found positive for T. gondii specific-IgG and IgM antibodies, and 2 (1.6%) and 74 (57.8%) samples were confirmed positive for N. caninum specific-IgG and IgM antibodies, respectively. Out of 224 stray dog sera, 59.8% and 58.9% were recorded as positive against anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM antibodies, 17.9% and 64.7% were detected positive against Neospora IgG and IgM. On the other hand, 1 of 18 cat fecal samples was successfully amplified within the Ct value of 10 to 30 while no cat was positive for neosporosis. Moreover, a higher prevalence of toxoplasmosis in stray dogs (14.5%, 16/110) than of neosporosis (5.5%, 6/110) with different parasite numbers were found. Further analysis showed that no significant sex differences were found nor between the overall infection rates of T. gondii and N. caninum in this study. This study suggests that stray cats and dogs play key roles in the transmission and prevalence of T. gondii and N. caninum in the plateau area.

AB  - Dopamine D4 receptor (D4R) mechanisms are implicated in psychiatric diseases characterized by cognitive deficits, including schizophrenia, ADHD, and autism. The cellular mechanisms are poorly understood, but impaired neuronal synchronization in cortical networks was proposed to contribute to these deficits. In animal experiments, D4R activation was shown to generate aberrant increased gamma oscillations and to reduce performance on cognitive tasks requiring functional prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) networks. While fast oscillations in the gamma range are important for local synchronization within neuronal ensembles, long-range synchronization between distant structures is achieved by slow rhythms in the delta, theta, alpha ranges. The characteristics of slow oscillations vary between structures during cognitive tasks. HPC activity is dominated by theta rhythm, whereas PFC generates unique oscillations in the 2-4 Hz range. In order to investigate the role of D4R on slow rhythms, cortical activity was recorded in rats under urethane anesthesia in which slow oscillations can be elicited in a controlled manner without behavioral confounds, by electrical stimulation of the brainstem reticular formation. The local field potential segments during stimulations were extracted and subjected to fast Fourier transform to obtain power density spectra. The selective D4R agonist A-412997 (5 and 10 mg/kg) and antagonists L-745870 (5 and 10 mg/kg) were injected systemically and the peak power in the two frequency ranges were compared before and after the injection. We found that D4R compounds significantly changed the activity of both HPC and PFC, but the direction of the effect was opposite in the two structures. D4R agonist enhanced PFC slow rhythm (delta, 2-4 Hz) and suppressed HPC theta, whereas the antagonist had an opposite effect. Analogous changes of the two slow rhythms were also found in the thalamic nucleus reuniens, which has connections to both forebrain structures. Slow oscillations play a key role in interregional cortical coupling; delta and theta oscillations were shown in particular, to entrain neuronal firing and to modulate gamma activity in interconnected forebrain structures with a relative HPC theta dominance over PFC. Thus, the results of this study indicate that D4R activation may introduce an abnormal bias in the bidirectional PFC-HPC coupling which can be reversed by D4R antagonists.

AB  - Intensive livestock production has been subject to increasing public criticism, including a demand for more animal-friendly housing systems and transparency. Since animal welfare is a credence attribute which cannot be evaluated on the product itself, recently various labels have been introduced to help consumers make purchasing decisions according to their animal welfare concerns. However, such labels need to be accompanied by adequate information to reveal full market power. Research on how animal welfare labels should be communicated to improve efficiency is scarce. The aim of our study is therefore to investigate the impact of different information types on the understanding and evaluation, willingness to buy (WTB) and willingness to pay (WTP) for an animal-friendly product. We used a quantitative research approach with four experimental groups (n = 200). Each group (n = 50) was presented with one of four information types that differed regarding their immersive and innovative character and all provided information about the main label criteria: group 1 received text only, group 2 text and stable pictures, group 3 text and a 360 degrees stable video via tablet, group 4 text and a 360 degrees stable video via virtual reality (VR) glasses. Regardless of information type, participants' understanding of the label as well as their evaluation of animal welfare and acceptability of an exemplary stable presented improved after information was given. Furthermore, providing information positively influenced the WTB and WTP. Regarding user experience, stable insights via VR glasses were particularly appreciated, even though more simpler types were considered more favourable in terms of the usage at the point of sale (POS). We conclude that various information types can be promising to communicate certain label criteria. Both higher immersive and innovative as well as more simple information types help to make animal welfare efforts more appreciated and support consumers in decision making.

AB  - The application of these NIPAm-based temperature-sensitive hydrogels in wearable sensing is limited by the inability to achieve a long-lasting temperature response and adaptive optical regulation due to water loss in the hydrogel, the inability to avoid the phenomenon of detachment due to the external touch, and the mutual interference between temperature and stress signals. Here, sandwich-structured organogel sensors (SOGS) are prepared based on solvent modulation and interfacial fusion cross-linking strategies to achieve asymmetric-adhesion, adaptive optical regulation, and simultaneous sensing of human motion and temperature without interference between the sensing signals. Modulation of temperature-sensitive properties through hydrogen bonding between glycol and amide groups for long-term temperature sensing (10-30 degrees C) and adaptive infrared and ultraviolet regulation. Adhesive conductive organogel is introduced under the temperature-sensitive organogel by an interfacial fusion cross-linking strategy for unilateral interfacial adhesion (67.28 kPa for pig skin) and stress sensing. The intermediate interfacial layer prevents the mutual interference between temperature and stress sensing signals. In conclusion, the solvent modulation strategy provides a new idea for developing novel temperature responsive gels, and the interfacial fusion cross-linking strategy provides a facile method for developing unilaterally adherent, interference-resistant, and multifunctional wearable sensors.

AB  - Cortical network undergoes rewiring everyday due to learning and memory events. To investigate the trends of population adaptation in neocortex overtime, we record cellular activity of large-scale cortical populations in response to neutral environments and conditioned contexts and identify a general intrinsic cortical adaptation mechanism, naming rectified activity-dependent population plasticity (RAPP). Comparing each adjacent day, the previously activated neurons reduce activity, but remain with residual potentiation, and increase population variability in proportion to their activity during previous recall trials. RAPP predicts both the decay of context-induced activity patterns and the emergence of sparse memory traces. Simulation analysis reveal that the local inhibitory connections might account for the residual potentiation in RAPP. Intriguingly, introducing the RAPP phenomenon in the artificial neural network show promising improvement in small sample size pattern recognition tasks. Thus, RAPP represents a phenomenon of cortical adaptation, contributing to the emergence of long-lasting memory and high cognitive functions.
   RAPP phenomenon describes a formula to measure intrinsic adaptation of neuronal population activity, which carries features of both the homeostasis regulation of the original state and the distilling of sparse memory traces in neocortex.

AB  - Simple Summary Despite the regional preferences for quail eggs and meat, and the main production being found in Asian countries, the popularity of quail raising has increased and their production has been introduced in many other countries, including the Baltics. A wide distribution around the world encouraged genetic divergence among Japanese quail populations, the formation of different breeds and lines as well as their research. The Estonian quail, a breed developed in Estonia, has also spread in Lithuania. This study aimed to evaluate yolk and albumen colour, as well as the nutritional value of yolk lipids in Estonian quail eggs using diets supplemented with cakes from local oil corns (rapeseed, hemp and camelina seeds). The diet affected the colour as well as the cholesterol content and fatty acid composition of the yolk. All quail groups demonstrated the high lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*) of the yolk; however, the negative value of parameter a*, instead of being red, showed a greenish colour. The highest proportions of total saturated (SFAs) and polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fatty acids as well as the lowest monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were found in the yolk lipids of the quail which was fed a mixture supplemented with hemp cake. The lowest and most favourable n-6/n-3 ratio was demonstrated by the quail fed the diet supplemented with camelina. However, the lowest yolk cholesterol content was demonstrated by the quail fed the diet supplemented with rapeseed cake. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of supplementing commercial diets with rapeseed, hempseed and camelina seed cakes on the yolk and albumen colour and nutritional value of yolk lipids in Estonian quail eggs. A total of 585 eggs were used to evaluate egg weight, yolk and albumen pH and colour, proximate yolk composition, cholesterol content and fatty acid composition in the yolk lipids of three Estonian quail groups each fed a diet supplemented with 10% rapeseed, hemp or camelina seed cakes. The higher (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) lightness (L*) of the yolk was detected in the group of quail fed the diet supplemented with rapeseed and camelina cakes compared to the hempseed addition. Meanwhile, the albumen lightness in the rapeseed group was higher (p < 0.01) in comparison to the camelina group. A lower (p < 0.001) yolk negative a* value was estimated in the hemp group than in the groups fed rapeseed and camelina seed cake supplements, while the rapeseed group demonstrated lower (p < 0.001) albumen yellowness (b*) and colour saturation (C) in comparison to the other groups. The highest and lowest proportions of total saturated (SFAs)and monounsaturated (MUFAs) fatty acids, respectively, were found in the yolk lipids of quails fed a mixture supplemented by hemp cake. A higher (p < 0.05) proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was only found in the hemp group compared to the camelina group. The highest and lowest (p < 0.001) n-6/n-3 PUFA ratios were found in the yolk lipids of quail receiving mixtures supplemented with rapeseed and camelina cakes, respectively. The yolk of the quail from the rapeseed group showed more favourable lower and higher (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) atherogenic index (AI) and hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic (h/H) ratio compared to the hemp and camelina groups.
   The lower yolk cholesterol content was found in the eggs of the quail fed the diet supplemented with rapeseed cake compared to the eggs of the quail which were fed the diets containing more n-3 PUFAs from the addition of hemp and camelina cakes (p < 0.05 and p < 0.
   01, respectively).

AB  - BackgroundPhosphodiesterase type 4D (PDE4D) breaks down cyclic AMP (cAMP) reducing the signaling of this intracellular second messenger which plays a major role in melanocyte pathophysiology. In advanced melanoma, expression of PDE4D is increased, plays a role in tumor invasion and is negatively associated with survival. In the current work, we investigated the role of PDE4D in the resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway-targeted therapy.MethodsEstablished human melanoma cell line sensitive and resistant to BRAF and MEK inhibitors and tumor tissues from melanoma patients were used in this study. Immunoblotting was used to analyze protein expression and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was used to analyze mRNA expression. DNA methylation analysis was evaluated via bisulfite treatment followed by quantitative PCR. Cell viability was measured by clonogenic assays or spheroid cultures. Cell xenograft experiments in immunodeficient mice were used to validate the results in vivo.ResultsAnalysis of baseline tumors from patients with BRAFV600E-mutated melanoma treated with MAPK inhibitors showed that higher PDE4D expression in situ predicted worse survival in patients. Furthermore, acquired resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors was associated with overexpression of PDE4D in situ and ex vivo. The overexpression of the PDE4D5 isoform in melanoma cells resistant to targeted therapies was explained by demethylation or deletion of a CpG island located upstream of the PDE4D5 promoter. We further showed that PDE4D overexpression allowed RAF1 activation, promoting a switch from BRAF to RAF1 isoform in BRAF-mutated melanoma, favoring resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. As a result, pharmacological inhibition of PDE4 activity impeded the proliferation of resistant cells ex vivo and in vivo. The anti-tumorigenic activity of PDE4 inhibitor was achieved via inhibition of the Hippo pathway which plays an important role in resistance to targeted therapies.ConclusionsIn summary, our research showed that PDE4D drives rewiring of the MAPK pathway in BRAF-mutated melanoma resistant to MAPK inhibitors and suggests that PDE4 inhibition is a novel therapeutic option for treatment of BRAF-mutated melanoma patients.

AB  - Introduction: In the early stage of embryonic development, the neural tube (NT) cannot be closed properly due to some complex factors, including environmental factors, genetic factors, and the relationship between various factors, leading to the occurrence of neural tube defects (NTDs).Methods: In this study, we induced a mouse model of NTDs by feeding mice with a low-folate diet and intraperitoneally injecting them with 1.5 mg/kg methotrexate on E7.5. Fetal mice were achieved at E13.5, and we extracted proteins from brain tissues with trypsin digestion. After enzymatic digestion, peptides were labeled with TMT/iTRAQ and separated in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for subsequent liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) analysis. We used gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation to analyze proteomic changes and analyze the functional enrichment of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the NTD mice tissues.Results: A low-folate-induced mouse model was successfully constructed. Folate was used as a sensitizing agent, and the teratogenicity rate of the NTD fetal mice increased to 36.5% when the concentration of methotrexate was at 1.5 mg/kg. Mass spectrometry was used to identify 6,614 proteins, and among them, 5,656 proteins were quantified. In the following proteomic analysis, GO classification and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were conducted, and heatmaps were drawn for differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). The main pathways associated with NTDs, such as the Hedgehog, Wnt, p53, and Hippo signaling pathways and the one-carbon pool mediated by folate, can be identified through a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. It was also found that the regulation of ribosomal proteins, such as RPL13 and RPL14, which are upregulated in NTDs, has a certain impact on neural tube development.Discussion: Our results revealed proteomic changes in the tissues of low-folate-induced NTD mice. Validation showed that ribosomal proteins play a regulatory role during the development of NTDs and provides new ideas for the pathogenesis and preventive measures of NTDs.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Can in vitro maturation (IVM) and developmental competence of human oocytes be improved by co-culture with ovarian support cells (OSCs) derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: OSC-IVM significantly improves the rates of metaphase II (MII) formation and euploid Day 5 or 6 blastocyst formation, when compared to a commercially available IVM system.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: IVM has historically shown highly variable performance in maturing oocytes and generating oocytes with strong developmental capacity, while limited studies have shown a positive benefit of primary granulosa cell co-culture for IVM. We recently reported the development of OSCs generated from hiPSCs that recapitulate dynamic ovarian function in vitro.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study was designed as a basic science study, using randomized sibling oocyte specimen allocation. Using pilot study data, a prospective sample size of 20 donors or at least 65 oocytes per condition were used for subsequent experiments. A total of 67 oocyte donors were recruited to undergo abbreviated gonadotropin stimulation with or without hCG triggers and retrieved cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were allocated between the OSC-IVM or control conditions (fetal-like OSC (FOSC)-IVM or media-only IVM) in three independent experimental design formats. The total study duration was 1 April 2022 to 1 July 2023.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Oocyte donors between the ages of 19 and 37 years were recruited for retrieval after informed consent, with assessment of anti-Mullerian hormone, antral follicle count, age, BMI and ovarian pathology used for inclusion and exclusion criteria. In experiment 1, 27 oocyte donors were recruited, in experiment 2, 23 oocyte donors were recruited, and in experiment 3, 17 oocyte donors and 3 sperm donors were recruited. The OSC-IVM culture condition was composed of 100 000 OSCs in suspension culture with hCG, recombinant FSH, androstenedione, and doxycycline supplementation. IVM controls lacked OSCs and contained either the same supplementation, FSH and hCG only (a commercial IVM control), or FOSCs with the same supplementation (Media control). Experiment 1 compared OSC-IVM, FOSC-IVM, and a Media control, while experiments 2 and 3 compared OSC-IVM and a commercial IVM control. Primary endpoints in the first two experiments were the MII formation (i.e. maturation) rate and morphological quality assessment. In the third experiment, the fertilization and embryo formation rates were assessed with genetic testing for aneuploidy and epigenetic quality in blastocysts.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We observed a statistically significant improvement (similar to 1.5x) in maturation outcomes for oocytes that underwent IVM with OSCs compared to control Media-IVM and FOSC-IVM in experiment 1. More specifically, the OSC-IVM group yielded a MII formation rate of 68% +/- 6.83% SEM versus 46% +/- 8.51% SEM in the Media control (P = 0.02592, unpaired ttest). FOSC-IVM yielded a 51% +/- 9.23% SEM MII formation rate which did not significantly differ from the media control (P = 0.77 unpaired t-test). Additionally, OSC-IVM yielded a statistically significant similar to 1.6x higher average MII formation rate at 68% +/- 6.74% when compared to 43% +/- 7.90% in the commercially available IVM control condition (P = 0.0349, paired t-test) in experiment 2. Oocyte morphological quality between OSC-IVM and the controls did not significantly differ. In experiment 3, OSC-IVM oocytes demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in Day 5 or 6 euploid blastocyst formation per COC compared to the commercial IVM control (25% +/- 7.47% vs 11% +/- 3.82%, P = 0.0349 logistic regression). Also in experiment 3, the OSC-treated oocytes generated blastocysts with similar global and germline differentially methylated region epigenetic profiles compared commercial IVM controls or blastocysts after either conventional ovarian stimulation.
   LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: While the findings of this study are compelling, the cohort size remains limited and was powered on preliminary pilot studies, and the basic research nature of the study limits generalizability compared to randomized control trials. Additionally, use of hCG-triggered cycles results in a heterogenous oocyte cohort, and potential differences in the underlying maturation state of oocytes pre-IVM may limit or bias findings. Further research is needed to clarify and characterize the precise mechanism of action of the OSC-IVM system. Further research is also needed to establish whether these embryos are capable of implantation and further development, a key indication of their clinical utility.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Together, these findings demonstrate a novel approach to IVM with broad applicability to modern ART practice. The controls used in this study are in line with and have produced similar to findings to those in the literature, and the outcome of this study supports findings from previous co-culture studies that found benefits of primary granulosa cells on IVM outcomes. The OSC-IVM system shows promise as a highly flexible IVM approach that can complement a broad range of stimulation styles and patient populations. Particularly for patients who cannot or prefer not to undergo conventional gonadotropin stimulation, OSC-IVM may present a viable path for obtaining developmentally competent, mature oocytes.

AB  - The accuracy of peak streamflow simulation is often lower than that of normal streamflow simulation, posing a significant challenge. This study introduces stochastic resonance (SR) to enhance simulation accuracy, utilizing its ability to leverage noise energy to improve correlations between streamflow and meteorological factors. The proposed SR-LSTM model, validated across major Chinese basins, demonstrates that SR effectively enhances the accuracy of streamflow simulations. By using SR, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency increased from 0.70 to 0.79, and the kling-gupta efficiency improved from 0.69 to 0.82. Furthermore, this study utilizes the global Caravan streamflow data set (including CAMELES, CAMELESBR, CAMELESAUS, and LamaH) comprising 1,244 station data points to validate the applicability of SR-LSTM. Results indicate that SR improves accuracy at approximately 70% of 1,244 stations, particularly in regions with high-quality data. Comparative analysis shows that incorporating SR enhances the performance of deep learning models, highlighting its potential for improving both global and peak streamflow simulation accuracy. These findings underscore the effectiveness of SR in enhancing streamflow simulation accuracy.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that regional deep learning (DL) models can improve runoff prediction by leveraging large hydrological datasets. However, training a DL regional model using all data without screening may degrade local performance. This study focuses on constructing enhanced local models through the utilization of cross-basin data. To this end, we propose an approach that employs a novel training strategy to optimize DL model training for specific basins. The approach measures the impact of any one basin's gradient on the loss of the basin of interest, providing insights into the relationships between different basins. The approach was validated using 531 basins from the CAMELS dataset. Results suggest that local performance degradation is a common occurrence in regional models, and imbalanced data are likely to result in a specific pattern dominating the entire regional model. In comparison to a regional model simply trained with all basins, the median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for our models is 0.031 higher. In particular, the increase in NSE can exceed 0.2 for some dry basins. Our findings indicate that this novel DL strategy can significantly improve model performance in specific basins using large hydrological datasets, while mitigating local performance loss.
   In the realm of deep learning, incorporating more data into the training process typically results in a more potent model. Conventionally, large datasets have been employed to train regional models with the intention of predicting rainfall-runoff processes across all basins. However, such regional models often encounter performance degradation when applied to local basins. This degradation can be attributed to the extraction of overly general features, leading to a loss of specificity. In this paper, our objective is to harness information from a large dataset to establish a more robust local model. We have introduced a method that autonomously learns the similarities in rainfall-runoff behavior among basins. Subsequently, we utilize this learned similarity to selectively choose data that proves advantageous for training the local model. Our results demonstrate that this strategy can significantly enhance runoff prediction, particularly in arid basins.
   Training a DL regional model using all data without screening may degrade local performance Proper selection of training data is crucial for enhancing DL model training for individual basins, especially arid basins Data from different basins might act as mutual noise during the training process

AB  - Currently, the application of outdoor hyperspectral imaging technology still primarily relies on manually selecting regions of interest (ROI). Due to the complex growth environment of Camellia oleifera fruits, severe situations such as branch and leaf occlusion, fruit overlapping, and background interference, realizing in-situ automatic segmentation of Camellia oleifera fruits and the precise extraction of fruit spectral information still faces serious challenges. This study proposes a CA-TransUNet++ model that integrates the Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism with a Transformer-based architecture. By leveraging multi-scale feature extraction and global information modeling, the proposed model significantly enhances the semantic segmentation performance for Camellia oleifera fruit images. Transfer learning was introduced on a small-scale hyperspectral dataset, which can effectively accelerate the model convergence and improve its generalization capability. The experimental results showed that the proposed model achieves Mean Intersection Over Union (MIoU), Mean Pixel Accuracy (MPA), and Dice Similarity Coefficient (Dice) scores of 92.14 %, 96.51 %, and 95.81 %, respectively. Furthermore, by combining spectral clustering methods, the adherent fruit region can be segmented precisely to ensure the accuracy of the fruit spectral information automatically extracted from the raw hyperspectral images. Compared with manual ROI extraction, the spectral information obtained using the proposed method demonstrated high consistency with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 99.03 %, and the extraction time was significantly reduced. This research provides a feasible method for real-time monitoring and refined management of largescale Camellia oleifera orchards, which has the potential to be extended to other economic crops.

AB  - The Brassicaceae Camelina sativa (gold of pleasure) is now an established niche crop and being used as a transgenic host for a range of novel seed traits. Most notable of these is the accumulation of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturates such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), fatty acids normally only found in marine organisms. As part of continued efforts to optimize the accumulation of these non-native fatty acids via seed-specific expression of algal genes, a new series of iterative constructs was built and introduced into Camelina. Seed fatty acid composition was determined, and the presence of EPA and DHA was confirmed. To provide an additional level of evaluation, full environmental release was carried out on selected events, providing a real-world gauntlet against which to assess the performance of these novel lines. Composition of the seed oil triacylglycerol was determined by mass spectrometry, allowing for conclusions as to the contribution of different activities to the final accumulation of EPA and DHA. Since these data were derived from field-grown material, they also represent a robust demonstration of the stability of the omega-3 LC-PUFA trait in Camelina. We propose that field trialling should be routinely incorporated in the plant synthetic biology 'design-build-test-learn' cycle.

AB  - Ketocarotenoids, including astaxanthin, are red lipophilic pigments derived from the oxygenation of beta-carotene ionone rings. These carotenoids have exceptional antioxidant capacity and high commercial value as natural pigments, especially for aquaculture feedstocks to confer red flesh colour to salmon and shrimp. Ketocarotenoid biosynthetic pathways occur only in selected bacterial, algal, fungal and plant species, which provide genetic resources for biotechnological ketocarotenoid production. Toward pathway optimization, we developed a transient platform for ketocarotenoid production using Agrobacterium infiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves with plant (Adonis aestivalis) genes, carotenoid beta-ring 4-dehydrogenase 2 (CBFD2) and carotenoid 4-hydroxy-beta-ring 4-dehydrogenase (HBFD1), or bacterial (Brevundimonas) genes, beta-carotene ketolase (crtW) and beta-carotene hydroxylase (crtZ). In this test system, heterologous expression of the plant-derived astaxanthin pathway conferred higher astaxanthin production with fewer ketocarotenoid intermediates than the bacterial pathway. We evaluated the plant-derived pathway for ketocarotenoid production using the oilseed camelina (Camelina sativa) as a production platform. Genes for CBFD2 and HBFD1 and maize phytoene synthase were introduced under the control of seed-specific promoters. In contrast to prior research with bacterial pathways, our strategy resulted in nearly complete conversion of beta-carotene to ketocarotenoids, including primarily astaxanthin. Tentative identities of other ketocarotenoids were established by chemical evaluation. Seeds from multi-season US and UK field sites maximally accumulated similar to 135 mu g/g seed weight of ketocarotenoids, including astaxanthin (similar to 47 mu g/g seed weight). Although plants had no observable growth reduction, seed size and oil content were reduced in astaxanthin-producing lines. Oil extracted from ketocarotenoid-accumulating seeds showed significantly enhanced oxidative stability and was useful for food oleogel applications.

AB  - Introduction Schizophrenia is considered one of the most disabling and severe human diseases worldwide. The etiology of schizophrenia is thought to be multifactorial and evidence suggests that DNA methylation can play an important role in underlying pivotal neurobiological alterations of this disorder. Some studies have demonstrated the effects of dietary supplementation as an alternative approach to the prevention of schizophrenia, including folic acid. However, no study has ever investigated the role of such supplementation in altering the DNA methylation system in the context of schizophrenia.
   Objectives The present study aims to investigate the effects of maternal folic acid supplementation at different doses on nuclear methyltransferase activity of adult rat offspring subjected to an animal model schizophrenia induced by ketamine.
   Methods Adult female Wistar rats, (60 days old) received folic acid-deficient diet, control diet, or control diet plus folic acid supplementation (at 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg) during pregnancy and lactation. After reaching adulthood (60 days), the male offspring of these dams were subjected to the animal model of schizophrenia induced by 7 days of ketamine intraperitoneal injection (25 mg/kg). After the 7-day protocol, the activity of nuclear methyltransferase was evaluated in the brains of the offspring.
   Results Maternal folic acid supplementation at 50 mg/kg increased methyltransferase activity in the frontal cortex, while 10 mg/kg increased methyltransferase activity in the hippocampus. In the striatum of offspring treated with ketamine, maternal deficient diet, control diet, and folic acid supplementation at 5 mg/kg decreased methyltransferase activity compared to the control group. The folic acid supplementation at 10 and 50 mg/kg reversed this ketamine effect.
   Conclusions Maternal FA deficiency could be related to schizophrenia pathophysiology, while FA supplementation could present a protective effect since it demonstrated persistent effects in epigenetic parameters in adult offspring.

AB  - N-Ethyl-2-pyrrolidinone-substituted flavanols (EPSF) are marker compounds for long-term stored white teas. However, due to their low contents and diasteromeric configuration, EPSF compounds are challenging to isolate. In this study, two representative epimeric EPSF compounds, 5 & PRIME;& PRIME;& PRIME;R- and 5 & PRIME;& PRIME;& PRIME;S-epigallocatechin gallate-8-C N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinone (R-EGCG-cThea and S-EGCG-cThea), were isolated from white tea using centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC). Two different biphasic solvent systems composed of 1. N-hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (1:5:1:5, v/v/v/v) and 2. N-hexane-ethyl acetate-acetonitrile-water (0.7:3.0:1.3:5.0, v/v/v/v) were used for independent pre-fractionation experiments; 500 mg in each separation of white tea ethyl acetate partition were fractionated. The suitability of the two solvent systems was pre-evaluated by electrospray mass-spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) analysis for metabolite distribution and compared to the results of the CPC experimental data using specific metabolite partition ratio K-D values, selectivity factors alpha, and resolution factors R-S. After size-exclusion and semi-preparative reversed-phase liquid chromatography, 6.4 mg of R-EGCG-cThea and 2.9 mg of S-EGCG-cThea were recovered with purities over 95%. Further bioactivity evaluation showed that R- and S-EGCG-cThea possessed in vitro inhibition effects on alpha-glucosidase with IC50 of 70.3 and 161.7 mu M, respectively.

AB  - Introduction Two new dactylogyrid monogeneans, Anacanthorus cultro n. sp. and Notozothecium palometae n. sp., are described based on specimens collected from the gill filaments of Mylossoma albiscopum (Cope, 1872) (Characiformes: Serrasalmidae), a pelagic and herbivore teleost collected in the Tigre river, Loreto, Peru. Materials and methods Some monogeneans were stained with Gomori's trichrome and mounted in Canada Balsam to determine internal soft structures. Others were cleared in Hoyer's medium for the study of sclerotized structures. Drawings were made using a drawing tube and a microprojector. Results Anacanthorus cultro n. sp. is characterized by the presence of a rod-shaped male copulatory organ (MCO) lacking featherlike structures, and a knife-shaped accessory piece with a submedial knob. Notozothecium palometae n. sp. can be distinguished from all congeners by its MCO with a subbasal spur and an accessory piece with inverted hammer shaped. Conclusions This is the first data on the parasites of M. albiscopum, a popular fish in local markets. Anacanthorus cultro n. sp. is the twenty-fifth documented species of the genus in Peru, while N. palometae n. sp. represents the seventh species of the genus known to infect freshwater fish species in Peru.

AB  - Simple Summary Logging prohibition in Thailand national parks in 1989 ended work for most elephants and mahouts. Animal tourism developed, affording food and husbandry for elephants, and introducing tourism with young tigers. Media and research on wild animals in tourism have explored the animals' welfare, but not how tourism shifts human-animal relationships and affects the animal caregivers. Caregivers of elephants (n = 55) or tigers (n = 18) in both private and government tourism facilities in four cities were interviewed in Thai concerning how contexts and management styles impact the relationship between captive animals and caregivers. Mahouts working in private facilities used one-to-one management and were younger and more poorly compensated than those working at government-funded tourism facilities. Tiger caregivers in tourism had direct contact with young tigers, with group management; these caregivers also were younger than in government facilities, with fewer benefits. Most mahouts considered their elephants as family members; a slight majority of these mahouts questioned the ethics of this use of elephants. Tiger caregivers classified tigers as family or friend equally often; one-third of all declined answering whether they approved of use of tigers in tourism. While somewhat solving problems, animal tourism also creates some challenges. This study explored the perspectives of elephant mahouts (n = 55) and tiger caregivers (n = 18) working in 4 private or 2 government facilities in Thailand to learn their experiences and viewpoints pertaining to use of animals in tourism. Interviews were conducted in Thailand at facilities in four cities. Mahouts working in private tourism facilities used one-to-one management and were significantly younger and more poorly compensated than those working at government-funded zoos, where some had shifted to group management. Tiger caregivers in tourism had direct contact with young tigers, with group management; these caregivers also were significantly younger than in government zoos, and with fewer benefits. Mahouts and tiger caregivers differed in how they viewed their relationships with their animals. Most mahouts considered their elephants as family members; a slight majority of these questioned the ethics of use of elephants in tourism. Tiger caregivers classified tigers as family or friend equally often; one-third of tiger caregivers declined answering on their approval of using tigers in tourism. What to do with aging tigers is a problem; this may explain some tiger caregivers' reticence to answer questions about using young tigers in tourism. While solving some problems, animal tourism creates several challenges.

AB  - To solve the problem of poor recognition accuracy caused by various colors, uneven distribution, and occlusion by branches and leaves of Camellia oleifera fruits under natural growth conditions, this study proposes an improved deep learning network, YOLOv5s-CEDB, for Camellia oleifera fruit detection based on YOLOv5s. Coordinate Attention Mechanism (CoordAtt), Deformable Convolution (DConv), and Explicit Visual Center (EVC) are introduced to enhance the network's local and global feature extraction performance. To improve the detection performance for small and dense targets, the feature fusion module of the network was replaced with the designed light-bidirectional feature pyramid (light-BiFPN) structure. GhostConv was used to reduce the parameters and inference speed of the structure. A dataset with different light conditions, colors, and density levels of Camellia oleifera fruits was established, and performance evaluation experiments were conducted. Experimental results showed that the mean Average Precision (mAP) and F1-score of the designed YOLOv5sCEDB network reached 91.4 % and 89.6 %, respectively, which were 2.6 % and 3.6 % higher than those of the original YOLOv5s model, respectively, and the influencing frame rate arrived at 37.6 FPS. Under different colors, distribution densities, occlusion scenarios, and light intensities, the detection accuracy of the YOLOv5sCEDB network model was significantly better than those of the YOLOv5s, YOLOv8s and Faster-RCNN networks. It was verified that the proposed YOLOv5s-CEDB network could significantly improve the accuracy and stability of Camellia oleifera fruit detection, satisfying the requirements of yield estimation and intelligent harvesting.

AB  - Copper pollution in aquatic environments poses a significant health challenge due to its non-biodegradable nature. This study introduces a novel and environmentally friendly approach to preparing Camellia oleifera shell extract reduced graphene oxide (COS-rGO) for the effective removal of Cu(II) from aqueous solutions. By using a 0.5 g/L dosage of COS-rGO at a pH of 5.1 and a temperature of 20 degrees C, an 85.8 % removal efficiency (18.7 mg/g) of Cu(II) was achieved at an initial concentration of 10 mg/L. Various characterization techniques, including Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), were employed to examine the synthesized COS-rGO. Additionally, thermodynamic and kinetic studies were conducted to investigate the mechanism of Cu(II) adsorption on COS-rGO. The results demonstrate that the adsorption of Cu(II) on COS-rGO follows pseudosecond-order kinetics, representing a spontaneous exothermic reaction. Our findings further support that the removal of Cu(II) by COS-rGO is driven by chemical adsorption in accordance with the rate-controlled process based on the Langmuir adsorption model. Overall, this study presents the green synthesis of COS-rGO as a promising technique for producing a cost-effective adsorbent from waste materials, which can be utilized for the mitigation of heavy metals in water.

AB  - Introduction: Passive immunotherapy using polyclonal antibodies plays an important role in preventing and treating antigenic and pathogenic diseases. Polyclonal antibodies are used for therapeutic, diagnostic and investigational purposes, with adjuvants employed to enhance the immune response against proteins that are poorly antigenic or self-antigens. This study aimed to optimize current immunization methods by evaluating the novel adjuvant CoVaccine HT (TM) against the established Freund's at producing ovine polyclonal antibodies against pro-inflammatory cytokine human recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha).
   Methods: Castrated male Aberfield cross sheep were immunized with TNF-alpha in CoVaccine HT (TM) or Freund's adjuvant. The binding titer of antibodies for TNF-alpha and neutralization titer were determined in vitro, as well as the strength of antibody binding by a simple small scale affinity chromatography elution experiment. Animal welfare was monitored through inspection of immunization site reactions at regular time points and graded according to reaction size. The second part of the study looked at re-immunization using Freund's adjuvant alone every 4- or 8-weeks.
   Results: Freund's generated significantly higher antibody binding titers than CoVaccine HT (TM) but were less effective at neutralizing TNF-alpha which is a better indicator of functional potency. CoVaccine HT (TM) also caused fewer immunization site reactions, while no statistical difference was observed in the binding strength of antibodies. Re-immunization every 4- and 8-weeks showed no statistical difference.
   Conclusion: This study provides evidence that CoVaccine HT (TM) is superior to Freund's adjuvant for the production of antibodies to TNF-alpha, and supports the use of this alternative adjuvant for clinical and experimental use. The outcomes gained through this study are applicable to passive and active immunotherapy for the generation of polyclonal antibodies in human and veterinary medicine.

KW  - ELEMENT
AB  - Detailed modelling of masonry arch bridges and viaducts presents unique computational challenges. Not only do such structures exhibit complex nonlinear behaviour, but they are also difficult to describe within a consistent computational framework for high-fidelity simulations, due to the range of interactive components with varying geometric characteristics. This paper presents a novel parametric model design tool for the generation of detailed 3D FE meshes of realistic masonry arch bridges and viaducts. This tool has been developed according to a modular description as an add-on component within the Rhino - Grasshopper environment. It allows for modular complex bridge assemblages with independent definition of the key viaduct parts, including arch barrels, spandrel walls, piers as well as multi-layered fill. Moreover, new parts can be seamlessly introduced into the framework due to its modular nature. Notably, as all components are geometrically addressable, it is possible to further enhance the model generation tool by adding non-standard routines to create more complex geometry than that allowed by the current parametric definition. Importantly, the developed strategy enables variable fidelity model generation, where different segments of an analysed viaduct can be represented by meso- and/or macro-scale masonry descriptions at different levels of detail. This approach further enables the consideration of initial damage in the brick/blockwork, which is a very common feature of many existing masonry bridges and viaducts.

AB  - Introduction: Depression is a prevalent and persistent mental disease characterized by symptoms such as anhedonia, anxiety, and desperation. Although our previous study shows that Xiaochaihutang (XCHT) upregulates hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in depressed mice and rats, the underlying mechanism requires further clarification. Objectives: To assess the mechanism by which XCHT regulates hippocampal BDNF expression in chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)-induced mice. Methods: Adult C57BL/6J mice were exposed to CSDS for 10 consecutive days to establish a depression model. XCHT treatment (2.3, 7 and 21 g/kg, intragastric administration) was administered for 4 consecutive weeks. Behavioral assessments were sequentially conducted to investigate the antidepressant effects of CSDS-induced XCHT. Golgi staining, immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, real time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction and chromatin immunoprecipitation were then employed to study the mechanisms underlying the regulation of XCHT on hippocampal BDNF expression. Results: XCHT significantly improved CSDS-induced anhedonia, social avoidance, recognition memory impairment, and anxiety/depression-like behaviors in mice. XCHT significantly promoted neuronal complexity and dendritic spine maturation in the mouse hippocampus. Furthermore, XCHT reversed the CSDS-induced reduction in the number of hippocampal BDNF+ cells and increased hippocampal BDNF protein and mRNA levels by upregulating the expression of specific Bdnf exons I, IV and VI. XCHT increased Bdnf transcripts by upregulating histone H3K18 acetylation at the Bdnf promoters. The administration of an acetyltransferase inhibitor reversed the effects of these changes. Conclusion: XCHT may enhance the transcripts of specific Bdnf exons I, VI and VI by upregulating the H3K18 acetylation at the corresponding Bdnf promoters, which consequently promotes BDNF expression levels. This further promotes neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus, ultimately ameliorating anxiety/depression-like behavior in CSDS-induced mice.

AB  - Simple Summary: A common method of alleviating impending threats to wildlife populations is to relocate them from danger, which is known as mitigation translocation. However, these translocations have high failure rates because they lack appropriate funding, resources, and a knowledge of species requirements. Here, we use the endangered western spiny-tailed skink (Egernia stokesii badia) as a case study to exemplify how targeted ecological research can be used to help inform translocation planning. We found that the skinks have specific requirements for predator management, foraging and prey availability, and log pile structures, which can all help improve the targeted selection of translocation sites in the future. Application of a similar scientific framework to planning is likely to improve mitigation translocation success for a range of threatened species.
   Translocation science has made considerable progress over the last two decades; however, reptile translocations still frequently fail around the world. Major knowledge gaps surround the basic ecology of reptile species, including basic factors such as habitat preference, which have a critical influence on translocation success. The western spiny-tailed skink (Egernia stokesii badia) is used here as a case study to exemplify how empirical research can directly inform on-ground management and future translocation planning. A combination of studies, including LiDAR scanning of microhabitat structures, camera trapping, plasticine replica model experiments and unbounded point count surveys to assess predation risk, and visual and DNA analysis of dietary requirements, were all used to better understand the ecological requirements of E. s. badia. We found that the skinks have specific log pile requirements, both native and non-native predator management requirements, and a largely herbivorous, broad diet, which all influence translocation site selection and management planning. The use of E. s. badia as an Australian case study provides a clear strategic framework for the targeted research of meaningful ecological factors that influence translocation decision-making. Similar approaches applied to other reptile species are likely to fundamentally increase the capacity for effective management, and the likelihood of future successful translocations.

AB  - Introduction: Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in tissue injury and repair after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury and varies by sex. Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is a cytokine released by macrophages during inflammation and is upregulated after brain ischemia. We examined the impact of GDF-15 knockout (KO) on volume loss and the combined microglia/macrophage response in the Rice-Vannucci model of neonatal HI injury. Methods: Male and female wild-type (WT) Gdf15(+/+), heterozygous Gdf15(nuGFP-CE/+) (Het), and homozygous Gdf15(nuGFP-CE/nuGFP-CE) (KO) mice were bred at the University of Pittsburgh. Postnatal day 9-11 mice were randomized to sham procedure or unilateral common carotid artery ligation followed by exposure to 8% O-2 for 25 min. Pups were subsequently genotyped and survived for 14 days before sacrifice. Lesion volume and number of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1)-positive cells were quantified. Results: Injured male KO pups had decreased hemispheric and hippocampal lesion volume versus injured male WT pups. Injured male Het pups demonstrated an intermediate phenotype. In males, the number of Iba-1-positive cells correlated with extent of tissue loss. In females, the extent of volume loss and Iba-1 cell counts post-injury did not vary by genotype. Conclusion: GDF-15 exerts a sex-dependent deleterious effect on lesion volume in a neonatal HI model. Future work should identify how GDF-15 mediates different neuroinflammatory responses between sexes, establish if brain-secreted versus peripherally derived GDF-15 mediates the pro-injury phenotype that was inhibited in male KOs, and test if therapeutic inhibition of GDF-15 signaling is a novel treatment for neonatal HI brain injury.

AB  - Cell atlases serve as vital references for automating cell labeling in new samples, yet existing classification algorithms struggle with accuracy. Here we introduce SIMS (scalable, interpretable machine learning for single cell), a low-code data-efficient pipeline for single-cell RNA classification. We benchmark SIMS against datasets from different tissues and species. We demonstrate SIMS's efficacy in classifying cells in the brain, achieving high accuracy even with small training sets (<3,500 cells) and across different samples. SIMS accurately predicts neuronal subtypes in the developing brain, shedding light on genetic changes during neuronal differentiation and postmitotic fate refinement. Finally, we apply SIMS to single-cell RNA datasets of cortical organoids to predict cell identities and uncover genetic variations between cell lines. SIMS identifies cell-line differences and misannotated cell lineages in human cortical organoids derived from different pluripotent stem cell lines. Altogether, we show that SIMS is a versatile and robust tool for cell-type classification from single-cell datasets.

AB  - Introduction Fustin, a photogenic flavanol found in the plant Rhus verniciflua Stokes, has been involved in multiple disease ailments and has a beneficial pharmacological effect and a history of use in traditional medicine. The present research aimed to study the impact of fustin on scopolamine (SCOP)-induced memory impairment and neurodegeneration by modulating neuroinflammation and neurotransmitters in rats.Methods A total of 30 healthy Wistar rats were allocated into five groups (n=6). Group I- served as control and received saline solution (1mL/kg i.p.), group -II- fustin (100 mg/kg, orally), group -III -SCOP (1 mg/kg, i.p.), and group -IV and V were given fustin (50 and 100 mg/kg/p.o.) with SCOP (1 mg/kg, i.p.) for 14-days. After 14 days, 2 hours after SCOP injection, the Y-maze and Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed. After behavioral tests rats were subsequently euthanized, and brain supernatants were used to estimate choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), antioxidant [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH)], and total protein, oxidative stress markers [nitrate and malondialdehyde (MDA)], pro-inflammatory markers [tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), and Interleukins-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and IL-6]. Also, neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), Upsilon-amino butyric acid (GABA), acetylcholine (Ach), and noradrenaline (NA) contents were performed.Results Fustin exhibited substantial behavioral improvement in the Y-maze measures spontaneous alterations percentage (SA%) and decreased latency time following the acquisition and prolonged time spent in the probe trial in the MWM test. Moreover, fustin inhibits enhanced neuroinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers and improves the neurotransmitters.Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that fustin inhibits SCOP impact on cognitive abilities in rats. The present investigation demonstrates that fustin, a potent phytochemical, effectively mitigated the behavioral and physiological changes induced by SCOP in rats. This was primarily achieved by modulating the levels of inflammatory response and neurotransmitters.

AB  - Introduction: : Perinatal women often experience mood disorders and postpartum depression due to the physical load and the rapid changes in hormone levels caused by pregnancy, childbirth, and nursing. When the mother's emotions become unstable, their parental behavior (maternal behavior) may decline, the child's attachment may weaken, and the formation of mother-child bonding can become hindered. As a result, the growth of the child may be adversely affected. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of omega 3 fatty acid deficiency in the perinatal period on maternal behavior and the oxytocin concentration and fatty acid composition in brain tissue.
   Materials and methods: : Virgin female C57BL/6 J mice fed a omega 3 fatty acid-deficient omega 3-Def) or adequate omega 3-Adq) diet were mated for use in this study. To assess maternal behavior, nest shape was evaluated at a fixed time from gestational day (GD) 15 to postpartum day (PD) 13, and a retrieval test was conducted on PD 3. For neurochemical measurement, brains were removed from PD 1-6 dams and hippocampal fatty acids and hypothalamic oxytocin concentrations were assessed.
   Results: : Peripartum nest shape scores were similar to those reported previously (Harauma et al., 2016); nests in the omega 3-Def group were small and of poor quality whereas those in the omega 3-Adq group were large and elaborate. The inferiority of nest shape in the omega 3-Def group continued from PD 0-7. In the retrieval test performed on PD 3, dams in the omega 3-Def group took longer on several parameters compared with those in the omega 3-Adq group, including time to make contact with pups (sniffing time), time to start retrieving the next pup (interval time), and time to retrieve the last pup to the nest (grouping time). Hypothalamic oxytocin concentrations on PD 1-6 were lower in the omega 3-Def group than in the omega 3-Adq group.
   Discussion:: Our data show that omega 3 fatty acid deficiency reduces maternal behavior, a state that continued during pup rearing. This was supported by the observed decrease in hypothalamic oxytocin concentration in the omega 3-Def group. These results suggest that omega 3 fatty acid supplementation during the perinatal period is not only effective in delivering omega 3 fatty acids to infants but is also necessary to activate high-quality parental behavior in mothers.

AB  - PurposeFertility preservation for pre-pubertal girls undergoing gonadotoxic cancer treatments and women with systemic cancers at high risk for ovarian metastasis remains limited. Current options, such as ovarian cortex transplantation, risk reintroducing malignant cells. This study presents a novel approach focusing on ex vivo folliculogenesis and mature oocyte retrieval for cryopreservation, mitigating this risk.MethodsThis experimental study optimized an ex vivo ovarian perfusion system in sheep, refining gonadotropin stimulation to yield mature oocytes. Eleven ovaries were divided into two experimental subgroups: Group 1 (n = 5) and Group 2 (n = 6). Both groups were perfused in a bioreactor for 4 to 8 days under distinct perfusion protocols, differing in gonadotropin administration overnight-Group 1 did not receive overnight gonadotropin stimulation, whereas Group 2 received basal gonadotropin stimulation overnight. Assessments included follicular proliferation, oocyte maturity, apoptosis, ovarian function-related gene expression, and the levels of hormones, metabolites, and electrolytes in the culture medium, compared across subgroups.ResultsThe protocol without overnight ovarian stimulation yielded mature MII oocytes, despite fewer secondary follicles and overexpression of the pro-apoptotic BAX gene. Conversely, ovaries with overnight stimulation yielded mostly GV-MI oocytes and exhibited reduced secondary follicle proliferation and higher HIF1A expression. Hormone levels, metabolites, and electrolytes remained stable across groups and time.ConclusionsThis study is the first to report the successful harvesting of MII oocytes following extended ex vivo perfusion of intact ewe ovaries, highlighting the potential of the perfusion model to support advanced follicular development. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate underlying mechanisms and refine protocol efficiency.

AB  - Executive functions, learning, attention, and processing speed are imperative facets of cognitive performance, affected in neuropsychiatric disorders. In clinical studies on different patient groups, recombinant human (rh) erythropoietin (EPO) lastingly improved higher cognition and reduced brain matter loss. Correspondingly, rhEPO treatment of young rodents or EPO receptor (EPOR) overexpression in pyramidal neurons caused remarkable and enduring cognitive improvement, together with enhanced hippocampal long-term potentiation. The 'brain hardware upgrade', underlying these observations, includes an EPO induced similar to 20% increase in pyramidal neurons and oligodendrocytes in cornu ammonis hippocampi in the absence of elevated DNA synthesis. In parallel, EPO reduces microglia numbers and dampens their activity and metabolism as prerequisites for undisturbed EPO-driven differentiation of pre-existing local neuronal precursors. These processes depend on neuronal and microglial EPOR. This novel mechanism of powerful postnatal neurogenesis, outside the classical neurogenic niches, and on-demand delivery of new cells, paralleled by dendritic spine increase, let us hypothesize a physiological procognitive role of hypoxia-induced endogenous EPO in brain, which we imitate by rhEPO treatment. Here we delineate the brain EPO circle as working model explaining adaptive 'brain hardware upgrade' and improved performance. In this fundamental regulatory circle, neuronal networks, challenged by motor-cognitive tasks, drift into transient 'functional hypoxia', thereby triggering neuronal EPO/EPOR expression.

AB  - Introduction Chronic rhinosinusitis causes severe symptoms that can affect patient quality of life. Endoscopic sinus surgery can be effective in improving symptoms, although surgical outcomes can be compromised post-operatively, and revision surgery is required in a proportion of patients. This study compares outcomes and healthcare resource use in patients undergoing sinus surgery with or without Chitogel as a post-operative dressing.Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using deidentified audit data from adult patients with severe chronic rhinosinusitis, who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery between January 2016 and December 2021. Patients in the intervention group received Chitogel as a post-operative dressing, and control patients received standard best-practice care. Cox Proportional Hazards survival analysis was used to compare revision surgery rates and time to revision between treatment groups. The rate of revision surgery was used to estimate potential health sector savings associated with use of Chitogel following surgery compared to the control arm, considering initial treatment costs and the cost of revision surgery.Results Over 18-24 months, patients treated with Chitogel demonstrated significantly lower rates of revision surgery (p = 0.035), and a trend towards decreased use of post-operative steroids, compared to control. Potential health sector savings due to reduced rates of revision surgery following use of Chitogel are estimated as NZ $753,000 per 100 patients.Conclusion Severe chronic rhinosinusitis patients treated with Chitogel had lower rates of revision surgery within the first 18-24 months post-operative. These findings suggest that use of Chitogel can improve long-term patient outcomes and should improve health system efficiency.

AB  - Chronic liver injury follows inflammation and liver fibrosis; however, the molecular mechanism underlying fibrosis has not been fully elucidated. In this study, the role of ductal WW domain-containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) was investigated after liver injury. Ductal TAZ-knockout (DKO) mice showed decreased liver fibrosis following a Diethyl 1,4-dihydro-2,4,6-trimethyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate (DDC) diet compared to wild-type (WT) mice, as evidenced by decreased expression levels of fibrosis inducers, including connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf)/cellular communication network factor 2 (CCN2), cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (Cyr61/CCN1), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (Tgfb1), in DKO mice. Similarly, TAZ-knockout (KO) cholangiocyte organoids showed decreased expression of fibrosis inducers. Additionally, the culture supernatant of TAZ-KO cholangiocyte organoids decreased the fibrogenic gene expression in liver stellate cells. Further studies revealed that prominin 1 (PROM1/CD133) stimulated TAZ for fibrosis. After the administration of DDC diet, fibrosis was decreased in CD133-KO (CD133-KO) mice compared to that in WT mice. Similarly, CD133-KO cholangiocyte organoids showed decreased Ctgf, Cyr61, and Tgfb1 expression levels compared to WT cholangiocyte organoids. Mechanistically, CD133 stabilized TAZ via Src activation. Inhibition of Src decreased TAZ levels. Similarly, CD133-knockdown HCT116 cells showed decreased TAZ levels, but reintroduction of active Src recovered the TAZ levels. Taken together, our results suggest that TAZ facilitates liver fibrosis after a DDC diet via the CD133-Src-TAZ axis.

AB  - Cholinergic neuronal networks in the hippocampus play a key role in the regulation of learning and memory in mammals. Perturbations of these networks, in turn, underlie neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms remain largely undefined. We have recently demonstrated that an in vitro MEN1 gene deletion perturbs nicotinic cholinergic plasticity at the hippocampal glutamatergic synapses. Furthermore, MEN1 neuronal conditional knockout in freely behaving animals has also been shown to result in learning and memory deficits, though the evidence remains equivocal. In this study, using an AVV viral vector transcription approach, we provide direct evidence that MEN1 gene deletion in the CA1 region of the hippocampus indeed leads to contextual fear conditioning deficits in conditional knockout animals. This loss of function was, however, recovered when the same animals were re-injected to overexpress MEN1. This study provides the first direct evidence for the sufficiency and necessity of MEN1 in fear conditioning, and further endorses the role of menin in the regulation of cholinergic synaptic machinery in the hippocampus. These data underscore the importance of further exploring and revisiting the cholinergic hypothesis that underlies neurodegenerative diseases that affect learning and memory.

AB  - The clinical presentation of cat and dog allergy vary from discomfort caused by rhinoconjuncitivitis to severe asthma. Exposure to allergens from these animals is ubiquitous and allergic sensitization to cat or dog affect up to 25% of all children and adults, but allergic sensitization does not always cause symptoms. The introduction of molecular-based allergy diagnostics has improved the possibility to characterize the allergic patient in greater detail. However, the full clinical potential of using molecular allergology in the diagnosis, characterization and treatment of patients with allergy to cats and dogs has not yet been established, although significant progress has been made during the last decade, which will be reviewed in detail in this paper.

AB  - Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder. A variety of molecular and cellular abnormalities leads to behavioral deficits in autism. Nevertheless, its etiology and treatment strategy are not completely understood. Oxytocin has recently shown improvements in social functioning. This study aimed to evaluate the necroptosis pathway for the neuroprotective effects of oxytocin in the valproic acid-induced autism spectrum disorder model. The autism spectrum disorder was induced by valproic acid on gestational day 12.5 (600 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Offspring received intranasal oxytocin (1 & mu;g/& mu;L) on the 21st and 40th days after birth. The offspring behaviors were scrutinized by self-grooming, marble-burying, three-chamber, and Morris water maze tests. Western blot was performed on the hippocampus and amygdala tissues to investigate the expression of RIP3 and MLKL markers. The valproic acid group demonstrated more anxiety, repetitive behaviors, and expression of RIP3 and MLKL markers, and less social interaction and spatial memory compared with the control group. Oxytocin considerably improved social interactions, preference for social novelty, and memory. The elevated expression of RIP3 and MLKL markers in valproic acid-induced autistic rats were alleviated after treatment with oxytocin. We also highlighted the importance of age and gender in autism spectrum disorder interventions. Our findings suggested that oxytocin administration was as an effective treatment in two areas of repetitive/stereotyped behaviors, social interactions/cognitive function. Notably, early administration of oxytocin resulted in better therapeutic responses in autism-like behaviors. The molecular tests introduce oxytocin as a potential candidate for reducing the expression of necroptosis mediators in the brain. This reinforced our hypothesis that the necroptosis pathway takes part in autism spectrum disorder.

AB  - Background Thyroid hormones play a vital function in the maturation in the course of mind development. Regarding the well-known effects of choline on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the study examined the effects of choline on hippocampal BDNF gene expression in maternal hypothyroidism rats. Methods and results To induce the hypothyroidism, 6-propyl-2-thiouracil was introduced to the ingesting water from the sixth day of gestation to twenty-first postnatal day (PND). Choline-treatment started twice a day on the first day of gestation until PND 21. On PND28, pups were sacrificed. The expression of BDNF gene was evaluated after the hippocampus was harvested. Our results demonstrated that both male and female pre-pubertal offspring rats' BDNF gene expression was decreased by developmental hypothyroidism. Choline increases the ratio of relative gene expression of BDNF in the hippocampus of males and females in the control/hypothyroidism group, especially in males. Conclusions It can be concluded that maternal choline supplementation on the first day of gestation until PND 21 improves brain development and cognitive function in pre-pubertal offspring rats regarding control/hypothyroidism groups.

AB  - Female rhinoceroses have an ovarian reserve that consists of immature oocytes in primordial follicles. Establishing methods to grow and culture these oocytes from those follicles in the laboratory might fuel efforts towards in vitro embryo production in this species without the need for repeated in vivo oocyte collection. In depth understanding of the biology behind and improvement of assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs) is the only option for preventing the disappearance of functionally extinct species such as the northern white rhinoceros. In vitro follicle development can only be obtained by in depth knowledge on rhinoceros ovarian histology. In addition to known ovarian features, we identified numerous undescribed structural and molecular ovarian characteristics from adult southern white rhinoceros (n=3). Ovarian sections were stained with H&E, PAS or Masson Trichrome and molecular analyses (hyaluronic acid detection, immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay) were performed to identify proliferation, extracellular matrix, pluripotency markers, hormones, enzymes, markers for inflammation or endocrine glands, blood vessel presence, oocyte markers and apoptosis. Besides degenerating, deformed, or luteinized follicles, analysis revealed several 'follicle-like structures' (FLS) that deviated from the expected follicle appearance. Most importantly, the majority of FLS did not contain any oocyte and were comprised of a collection of cells organised around fluid islands with or without an antral cavity. The discovery and description of FLS in aged southern white rhinoceroses may play a role in poor oocyte recovery rates in ovum pick-up (OPU) in older rhinoceroses. It remains to be investigated whether FLS might be present on ovaries from other rhinoceros species and whether they might serve as a general indicator for oocyte recovery success in aged females.

AB  - Background: Albino-induced yellow tea is becoming popular in East China because of its special sensory properties. More and more tea gardeners intend to grow albino-induced yellow tea (Camellia sinensis) plants to meet market demand.
   Results: To help them select the suitable cultivars to grow, agronomic traits (i.e., plant shape, survival rate, plant height, budding density, initial one bud with one leaf development date, albino grade of one bud with three leaves, length of one bud with three leaves, and the cumulative weight of 100 buds), chemical characteristics (i.e., water extract content, tea polyphenols content, free amino acids content, and caffeine content), and sensory evaluation score of six albino-induced yellow tea cultivars which were introduced and cultivated in Ningbo (a city in East China) were assessed. The principal component analysis (PCA) was used for the comprehensive evaluation. It turned out that the six albino-induced yellow tea cultivars were with distinguishable agronomic traits, chemical characteristics, and sensory properties. Four principal components were extracted by PCA and the cumulative variance contribution rate reached 96.773%. Among the six cultivars, "Jinguan Tea", "Zhonghuang No.3", and "Yujinxiang" got the top three highest principal component scores.
   Conclusion: According to the results, albino-induced yellow tea cultivars which are suitable to be introduced and cultivated in Ningbo, China, are "Jinguan Tea", "Zhonghuang No.3", and "Yujinxiang".

AB  - Cyberbullying is a remarkable issue in the Arabic-speaking world, affecting children, organizations, and businesses. Various efforts have been made to combat this problem through proposed models using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches utilizing natural language processing (NLP) methods and by proposing relevant datasets. However, most of these endeavors focused predominantly on the English language, leaving a substantial gap in addressing Arabic cyberbullying. Given the complexities of the Arabic language, transfer learning techniques and transformers present a promising approach to enhance the detection and classification of abusive content by leveraging large and pretrained models that use a large dataset. Therefore, this study proposes a hybrid model using transformers trained on extensive Arabic datasets. It then fine-tunes the hybrid model on a newly curated Arabic cyberbullying dataset collected from social media platforms, in particular Twitter. Additionally, the following two hybrid transformer models are introduced: the first combines CAmelid Morphologically-aware pretrained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (CAMeLBERT) with Arabic Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (AraGPT2) and the second combines Arabic BERT (AraBERT) with Cross-lingual Language Model RoBERTa (XLM-R). Two strategies, namely, feature fusion and ensemble voting, are employed to improve the model performance accuracy. Experimental results, measured through precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and Area Under the Curve-Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC), demonstrate that the combined CAMeLBERT and AraGPT2 models using feature fusion outperformed traditional DL models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), as well as other independent Arabic-based transformer models.

TI  - Trilobatin Alleviates Cognitive Deficits and Pathologies in an Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease nowadays that causes memory impairments. It is characterized by extracellular aggregates of amyloid-beta (A beta), intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated Tau (p-Tau), and other pathological features. Trilobatin (TLB), a natural flavonoid compound isolated from Lithocarpuspolystachyus Rehd., has emerged as a neuroprotective agent. However, the effects and mechanisms of TLB on Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear. In this research, different doses of TLB were orally introduced to 3xFAD AD model mice. The pathology, memory performance, and Toll-like receptor 4- (TLR4-) dependent inflammatory pathway protein level were assessed. Here, we show that TLB oral treatment protected 3xFAD AD model mice against the A beta burden, neuroinflammation, Tau hyperphosphorylation, synaptic degeneration, hippocampal neuronal loss, and memory impairment. The TLR4, a pattern recognition immune receptor, has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease-related neuroinflammation. We found that TLB suppressed glial activation by inhibiting the TLR4-MYD88-NF kappa B pathway, which leads to the inflammatory factor TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 reduction. Our study shows that TLR4 might be a key target of TLB in AD treatment and suggests a multifaceted target of TLB in halting AD. Taken together, our findings suggest a potential therapeutic effect of TLB in AD treatment.

AB  - Gap junctions (GJ) are suggested to support stem cell differentiation. The Muse cells that are applied in clinical trials are non-tumorigenic pluripotent-like endogenous stem cells, can be collected as stage-specific embryonic antigen 3 (SSEA-3+) positive cells from multiple tissues, and show triploblastic differentiation and self-renewability at a single cell level. They were reported to up-regulate pluripotency gene expression in suspension. We examined how GJ inhibition affected pluripotency gene expression in adherent cultured-Muse cells. Muse cells, mainly expressing gap junction alpha-1 protein (GJA1), reduced GJ intercellular communication from similar to 85% to 5-8% after 24 h incubation with 120 mu M 18 alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid, 400 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and 90 mu M dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, as confirmed by a dye-transfer assay. Following inhibition, NANOG, OCT3/4, and SOX2 were up-regulated 2-4.5 times more; other pluripotency-related genes, such as KLF4, CBX7, and SPRY2 were elevated; lineage-specific differentiation-related genes were down-regulated in quantitative-PCR and RNA-sequencing. Connexin43-siRNA introduction also confirmed the up-regulation of NANOG, OCT3/4, and SOX2. YAP, a co-transcriptional factor in the Hippo signaling pathway that regulates pluripotency gene expression, co-localized with GJA1 (also known as Cx43) in the cell membrane and was translocated to the nucleus after GJ inhibition. Adherent culture is usually more suitable for the stable expansion of cells than is a suspension culture. GJ inhibition is suggested to be a simple method to up-regulate pluripotency in an adherent culture that involves a Cx43-YAP axis in pluripotent stem cells, such as Muse cells.

AB  - Accumulation of misfolded proteins, known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, is known to participate in Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is also correlated with impaired central insulin signaling. However, few studies have probed the relationship between memory, central ER stress, inflammation, hippocampal mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and insulin resistance. The present study aimed to investigate the causative role and underlying mechanisms of brain ER stress in memory impairment and develop a reliable animal model for ER-mediated memory loss. Thapsigargin (TG), a known ER stress activator, was centrally administered. The cognitive function of animals was evaluated by the Morris Water Maze (MWM). To verify the induction of central ER stress, we investigated the mRNA expression of UPR markers in the hippocampus. In addition, the activation of ER stress markers, including Bip, CHOP, and some related apoptosis and pro-inflammatory proteins, such as caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, TNF-alpha, MAPK, and insulin signaling markers, were assessed by Western-blots. The results demonstrated that TG impairs spatial cognition and hippocampal insulin signaling. Meanwhile, molecular results showed a concurrent increment of hippocampal UPR markers, apoptosis, P38 activity, and TNF-alpha. This study introduced TG-induced ER stress as a pharmacological model for memory impairment in rats and revealed some underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Depression is one of the most prevalent psychiatric mood diseases worldwide, whose therapy is in urgent need of development. Although the neuroprotective effects of Rehmannioside A (Rea) have been demonstrated, its anti -depressive effect remains unclear. Here, a depression model was induced with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in rats. The behavioral trails, including sucrose preference test, forced swim test and open field test were used to determine the success of the CUMS-induced model. The effect of Rea on the neuronal protection, apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) was evaluated by HE, NISSL, IF and TUNEL staining, and western blot assays. Mechanically, the MAPK signaling pathway-related proteins expressions were examined by western blot. The results showed that CUMS stimulation evoked a prominent reduction of rat body weight, sucrose preference, and numbers of crossing, rearing and grooming with the enhanced immobility times. Besides, CUMS exposure induced the nuclear shrinkage and damage, as well as the decreased ISSL+ numbers. Moreover, CUMS stimulation increased the relative protein expressions of Bax and Cleaved caspase-3 and the percent of TUNEL positive cells, and decreased the relative protein expressions of Bcl-2. Furthermore, CUMS exposure also increased the relative protein expression of GRP-78, XBP-1, ATF-6, ATF-4 and CHOP. However, the CUMS-induced changes of all these indicators were reversed with Rea introduction in a dose-dependent fashion. Mechanically, Rea supply observably antagonized the CUMS-induced the relative protein levels of p-p38/p-38, p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 and p-JNK/JNK. Therefore, Rea attenuated depression through suppressing ERS and apoptosis in hippocampus of CUMS-induced rats involved in MAPK signaling.

AB  - Patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) typically experience substantial social isolation, which may cause secondary adverse effects on their brain development. miR-124 is the most abundant miRNA in the human brain, acting as a pivotal molecule regulating neuronal fate determination. Alterations of miR-124 maturation or expression are observed in various neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study, we analyzed a panel of brain-enriched microRNAs in serums from 2 to 6 year old boys diagnosed with ASD. The hsa-miR-124 level was found significantly elevated in ASD boys than in age and sex-matched healthy controls. In an isolation-reared weanling mouse model, we evidenced elevated mmu-miR-124 level in the serum and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These mice displayed significant sociability deficits, as well as myelin abnormality in the mPFC, which was partially rescued by expressing the miR-124 sponge in the bilateral mPFC, ubiquitously or specifically in oligodendroglia. In cultured mouse oligodendrocyte precursor cells, introducing a synthetic mmu-miR-124 inhibited the differentiation process through suppressing expression of nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (Nr4a1). Overexpressing Nr4a1 in the bilateral mPFC also corrected the social behavioral deficits and myelin impairments in the isolation-reared mice. This study revealed an unanticipated role of the miR-124/Nr4a1 signaling in regulating early social experience-dependent mPFC myelination, which may serve as a potential therapy target for social neglect or social isolation-related neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health problem and an essential cause of morbidity and mortality during childhood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the apoptotic effects of MK-801, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, on hippocampal damage in 10-day-old rat pups exposed to contusion injury.Methods Forty-two Wistar Albino rats were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 14 per group): control, trauma and MK-801 treatment. In the treatment group, MK-801 was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 1 mg/kg immediately after induction of TBI. Apoptotic damage in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 regions was assessed using immunoreactivity for BAX, cytochrome c and caspase-3.Results The control group showed low levels of BAX and cytochrome c immunoreactivity in the hippocampus, whereas the TBI group exhibited markedly increased reactions. Cytochrome c immunoreactivity appeared in a granular pattern within neurons of the DG region. In the MK-801 treatment group, both BAX and cytochrome c immunoreactivities were reduced compared to the TBI group. While only weak caspase-3 immunoreactivity was observed in the control group, intense immunoreactivity was detected in both the DG and CA1 regions of the hippocampus in the TBI group. In contrast, caspase-3 immunoreactivity was notably reduced in the MK-801 group compared to the TBI group.Conclusion This study demonstrated that treatment with MK-801 significantly reduces apoptosis in the hippocampus by downregulating key pro-apoptotic markers, including BAX, cytochrome c and caspase-3. These findings suggest that MK-801 exerts a neuroprotective effect by interfering with the intrinsic apoptotic pathway following TBI.

KW  - SEGMENTATION
AB  - Multiple instance learning (MIL) models have achieved remarkable success in analyzing whole slide images (WSIs) for disease classification problems. However, with regard to giga-pixel WSI classification problems, current MIL models are often incapable of differentiating a WSI with extremely small tumor lesions. This minute tumor-to-normal area ratio in a MIL bag inhibits the attention mechanism from properly weighting the areas corresponding to minor tumor lesions. To overcome this challenge, we propose salient instance inference MIL (SiiMIL), a weakly-supervised MIL model for WSI classification. We introduce a novel representation learning for histopathology images to identify representative normal keys. These keys facilitate the selection of salient instances within WSIs, forming bags with high tumor-to-normal ratios. Finally, an attention mechanism is employed for slide-level classification based on formed bags. Our results show that salient instance inference can improve the tumor-to-normal area ratio in the tumor WSIs. As a result, SiiMIL achieves 0.9225 AUC and 0.7551 recall on the Camelyon16 dataset, which outperforms the existing MIL models. In addition, SiiMIL can generate tumor-sensitive attention heatmaps that is more interpretable to pathologists than the widely used attentionbased MIL method. Our experiments imply that SiiMIL can accurately identify tumor instances, which could only take up less than 1% of a WSI, so that the ratio of tumor to normal instances within a bag can increase by two to four times.

AB  - Accurate cerebral neuron segmentation is required before neuron counting and neuron morphological analysis. Numerous algorithms for neuron segmentation have been published, but they are mainly evaluated using limited subsets from a specific anatomical region, targeting neurons of clear contrast and/or neurons with similar staining intensity. It is thus unclear how these algorithms perform on cerebral neurons in diverse anatomical regions. In this article, we introduce and reliably evaluate existing machine learning algorithms using a data set of microscopy images of macaque brain. This data set highlights various anatomical regions (e.g., cortex, caudate, thalamus, claustrum, putamen, hippocampus, subiculum, lateral geniculate, globus pallidus, etc.), poor contrast, and staining intensity differences of neurons. The evaluation was performed using 10 architectures of six classic machine learning algorithms in terms of typical Recall, Precision, F-score, aggregated Jaccard index (AJI), as well as a performance ranking of algorithms. F-score of most of the algorithms is superior to 0.7. Deep learning algorithms facilitate generally higher F-scores. U-net with suitable layer depth has been evaluated to be excellent classifiers with F-score of 0.846 and 0.837 when performing cross validation. The evaluation and analysis indicate the performance gap among algorithms in various anatomical regions and the strengths and limitations of each algorithm. The comparative result highlights at the same time the importance and difficulty of neuron segmentation and provides clues for future improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first comprehensive study for neuron segmentation in such large-scale anatomical regions.

AB  - IntroductionThe Hippo pathway and its transcriptional effectors yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are targets for cancer therapy. It is important to determine if the activation of one factor compensates for the inhibition of the other. Moreover, it is unknown if YAP/TAZ-directed perturbation affects cell-cell communication of non-malignant liver cells.Materials and MethodsTo investigate liver-specific phenotypes caused by YAP and TAZ inactivation, we generated mice with hepatocyte (HC) and biliary epithelial cell (BEC)-specific deletions for both factors (YAPKO, TAZKO and double knock-out (DKO)). Immunohistochemistry, single-cell sequencing, and proteomics were used to analyze liver tissues and serum.ResultsThe loss of BECs, liver fibrosis, and necrosis characterized livers from YAPKO and DKO mice. This phenotype was weakened in DKO tissues compared to specimens from YAPKO animals. After depletion of YAP in HCs and BECs, YAP expression was induced in non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) in a cholestasis-independent manner. YAP positivity was detected in subgroups of Kupffer cells (KCs) and endothelial cells (ECs). The secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines such as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 11 (CXCL11), fms-related receptor tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L), and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) was increased in the serum of YAPKO animals. YAP activation in NPCs could contribute to inflammation via TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD)-dependent transcriptional regulation of secreted factors.ConclusionYAP inactivation in HCs and BECs causes liver damage, and concomitant TAZ deletion does not enhance but reduces this phenotype. Additionally, we present a new mechanism by which YAP contributes to cell-cell communication originating from NPCs.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown how serious the problem of re-emerging zoonotic infections is for our existence. Migrations of animals, which are natural reservoirs of a particular virus, play a colossal role in the spread of pathogens to new territories. Examples are the migrations of both land animals (carnivores, rodents, and ungulates) and many marine mammals (pinnipeds and cetaceans). Yet the most interesting from the point of view of the speed and range of the spread of viral infections are migrations associated with flights. In nature, these can be migrations of insects, bats, and, of course, birds. Unfortunately, there are very few studies on the migration of these animals in Russia. Considering the problems related to climate change and other environmental factors, it is important to obtain up-to-date data on the changing animal migration routes and, as a consequence, to develop domestic equipment, particularly transmitters, to fix them.

AB  - Introduction: Primary lymphoma of the paranasal sinuses, especially involving the frontal sinus, is exceedingly rare. Extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) located in the head and neck frequently poses diagnostic challenges because its nonspecific symptoms can be mistaken for benign issues such as rhinosinusitis. Aim: This case report seeks to emphasize the challenges in diagnosis, the aggressive characteristics, and the effective treatment of an uncommon manifestation of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) primarily affecting the frontal and ethmoid sinuses. Case presentation: We present a case of a 62-year-old male who initially presented with symptoms suggestive of acute rhinosinusitis complicated by periorbital cellulitis. Diagnostic workup included physical examination, laboratory investigations, computed tomography (CT) imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histopathological (HP) analysis of biopsy specimens, immunohistochemical staining, and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT. The patient presented with right frontal headache, periorbital edema, palpebral ptosis, and posterior rhinorrhea. Initial CT revealed mucosal thickening, lytic changes, and a mass partially invading the right orbit. Following surgical excision, histopathology confirmed DLBCL with positivity for cluster of differentiation (CD)20, CD79a, B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-6, and Bcl-2, and a Ki-67 proliferation index of 90%. Subsequent MRI revealed a hypointense mass extending into surrounding structures. Staging CT confirmed stage IVB disease. The patient received six cycles of Rituximab-Cyclophosphamide, Hydroxydaunorubicin (Doxorubicin), Oncovin (Vincristine), Prednisolone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy and radiotherapy for the frontal sinus. At the 6-month and 12-month follow-up CT scans, there was no evidence of metabolically active disease on PET-CT (Deauville score 1). During the 2-year follow-up, the patient remained in complete remission. Conclusions: This case underscores the importance of considering malignancy in cases of atypical sinusitis and the crucial role of HP examination of biopsy specimens. This case also highlights the importance of considering malignancy in cases of atypical sinusitis.

AB  - In the ontogenesis of woody plants in general, and magnolia species in particular, the virginal age is quite long, and therefore is critically important from the point of view of selecting optimal conditions for growing plants. The study was conducted on biennial plants of deciduous magnolias: Magnolia kobus Sarg., M. obovata Thunb., M. denudata Desr. The studied plants were at the beginning of the virginile stage of development. The material for the investigation is selected from plants, which were planted by us in the research area of A. V. Fomin Botanical Garden of the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. In this study, we used scanning electron and light microscopes to examine the ultrastructure of the surface of leaves of the studied species. The histological characteristics of the leaves of the studied species are similar. They are hypostomatic. Their stomata are of the paracytic type, they are evenly distributed on the abaxial surface of the leaves. The epidermal cells of the studied species of the genus Magnolia have tortuous (cells located on the periphery of the leaf) or straight (cells located on the veins) outlines and rectangular (cells located on the veins) or flattened (cells placed on the periphery of the leaf) projection. The cuticle is relatively thin, located on both the abaxial and adaxial surfaces of the leaves. Epicuticular wax is observed of three types in the studied species: films (M. M. denudata), ), crust (M. M. kobus, , M. obovata) ) and wax granules (M. M. denudata, , M. obovata). ). The amount of wax and pubescence is greater on the abaxial surface in M. obovata; ; very weak pubescence and waxy layer is observed only on the abaxial surface of the leaf inM. M. kobus, , weak pubescence is present on both sides inM. M. denudata. . In all species of the genus Magnolia pubescence is simple, formed by hairs that "accompany" the veins. There are two main types of lamina relief in the studied species: reticular (M. M. obovata, , M. denudata (subtype reticular-collicular)) and pitted (M. M. kobus). ). The species clearly differ in this feature, so we believe that the type of relief of the lamina can be used as an additional diagnostic feature to distinguish species of the genus Magnolia. . Magnolia denudata is characterized by a small number of stomata, while M. obovata and M. kobus are characterized by their average number. The Stomata Index varies from 2.8 in M. denudata to 1.02 in M. kobus. . The lamina is the thickest in M. obovata, , the thinnest is in M. kobus, , but the total thickness of the epidermal tissue as a percentage of the thickness of the leaf is, in descending order: M. denudata (29%), M. kobus (24%), M. obovata (18%). The mesophyll varies from homogeneous-spongy (in M. kobus) ) to layered (in M. obovata,M. , M. denudata) ) type. The number of layers of cells that form the mesophyll in all studied species is from 4 to 6. Thus, M. kobus is characterized by the least specialized type of mesophyll. The vascular system in the studied plants is represented by small central and lateral vascular bundles. The ground tissue is present only in the central and large side bundles. In the early stages of ontogenesis the studied plants are typical mesophytes with hypostomatic leaves adapted to exist in sufficiently moist conditions in soil and air. In practical terms, the results of investigation can be used to select optimal conditions for growing plants at the initial stages of ontogenesis.

AB  - In order to obtain high-performance 3D printed parts, this study focuses on the key performance indicator of impact toughness. The parametric modeling software Rhino 6 is used to design impact specimens, and the laser selective melting equipment DiMetal-100, independently developed by the South China University of Technology, is used to manufacture impact specimens. Subsequently, the CoCrMo alloy parts were annealed using an MXQ1600-40 box-type atmosphere furnace and subjected to impact testing using a cantilever beam impact testing machine XJV-22. Fractal theory was applied to analyze the fractal behavior of the resulting impact fracture surfaces. The research results indicate that the 3D-printed impact specimens exhibited excellent surface quality, characterized by brightness, low roughness, and the absence of significant defects such as warping or deformation. In terms of annealing treatment, lower annealing temperatures did not improve the impact performance of SLM-formed CoCrMo alloy parts but instead led to a decrease in toughness. While increasing the annealing temperature can improve toughness to some extent, the effect is limited. Furthermore, the relationship between impact energy and heat treatment temperature exhibits a U-shaped trend. The fractal dimension analysis shows that the parts annealed in a 1200 degrees C furnace have the highest fractal dimension and better toughness performance. This study introduces a novel approach by comprehensively integrating advanced 3D printing technology, annealing processes, and fractal theory analysis to systematically investigate the influence of annealing temperature on the impact properties of 3D-printed CoCrMo alloy parts, thereby establishing a solid foundation for the application of high-performance 3D printed parts.

AB  - Human-elephant conflict is a common issue in the agricultural sector, often resulting in crop damage. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of threatening vocalisation playbacks as a mitigation method to deter elephant encroachment into agricultural areas. The study was conducted at the National Elephant Conservation Centre (NECC) in Kuala Gandah, Pahang, Malaysia, involving two male and five female elephants. Five soundtracks were played to observe the elephants' responses: the sound of a buzzing bee, a tiger roar, an elephant rumble, rain (control) and nocturnal jungle sounds (control). The elephants' behaviours were recorded during and after exposure to each soundtrack. The results showed that the elephants responded most strongly to the tiger roar (33%), followed by the buzzing bee sound (23%), while the elephant rumble elicited the fewest responses (8%). The tiger roar and buzzing bee sounds also resulted in the longest halt times, with the elephants stopping and standing still, particularly the older group (p < 0.05). Male and female elephants exhibited similar responses to the sound playbacks (p > 0.05). This study suggests that playback of threatening vocalisations could serve as an additional mitigation strategy to deter elephants from encroaching on agricultural sites, such as oil palm plantations.

AB  - BackgroundMethylphenidate (MPH) abuse has been criticized for its role in neurodegeneration. Also, a high risk of seizure was reported in the first month of MPH treatment. Topiramate, a broad-spectrum Antiepileptic Drug (AED), has been used as a neuroprotective agent in both aforementioned complications. Nanotechnology is introduced to increase desirable neurological treatment with minimum side effects. We aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective activity of topiramate loaded on nanoparticles.Methods and resultsMTT assay was performed to evaluate the cellular cytotoxicity of Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles (MSN). Male rats were randomly divided into eight groups. Rats received an intraperitoneal (i.p) MPH (10 mg/kg) injection and a daily oral dose of topiramate (TPM, 30 mg/kg), MSN with Zn core (10 and 30 mg/kg), and MSN with Cu core (10 and 30 mg/kg) for three weeks. On day 21, a seizure was induced by a single injection of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) to evaluate the protective effects of TPM-loaded nanoparticles on seizure latency and duration following MPH-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, the hippocampal content of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), malondialdehyde (MDA), and the anti-oxidant enzymes (SOD, GPx, and GR) activities were assessed. Also, BAX and Bcl-2 as two main apoptotic markers were evaluated.ResultsMPH neurotoxicity was observed as a raised duration and reduced latency in PTZ-induced seizure. However, TPM-loaded MSN with Zn species (NE) treatment reduced the duration and improved the latency time. Also, NE and, somewhat, TPM-loaded MSN with Cu species (NM) administration reduced inflammatory cytokines, MDA, and Bax levels and increased activities in the rat hippocampus.ConclusionTPM-loaded nanoparticles could be used as neuroprotective agents against MPH-induced neurodegeneration by improving seizure parameters and reducing inflammatory, oxidant, and apoptotic factors.

AB  - The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental condition that impacts social interaction and sensory processing, is rising. Valproic acid (VPA) exposure during pregnancy causes autistic-like traits in offspring. Olanzapine (OLZ), an atypical antipsychotic, is used to treat ASD. We assessed the impact of OLZ on behavior, neuromorphology, and nitric oxide (NO) levels in the hippocampus using prenatal VPA treatment in rats. It is commonly known that ASD patients exhibit sensory abnormalities. As such, we utilized the tail flick test to validate the ASD model. In the novel object recognition test (NORT), VPA exposure reduces the discrimination index (DI) in the first introduction to the novel object. Moreover, OLZ and vehicle-treated rats perform differently in the second exposition to the DI of the novel object, suggesting that OLZ reverses VPA-induced deficits in recognition memory. The latency to find the hidden platform in the Morris water maze test of memory and learning improves in VPA-exposed rats after OLZ administration, indicating that OLZ improves spatial memory in these rats. Administration of prenatal VPA induces neuronal hypotrophy and reduces spine density in pyramidal neurons of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Treatment with OLZ corrects the neuromorphological changes brought on by VPA. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, VPA treatment increases the number of neurons, which normalizes with OLZ treatment. OLZ increases the NO levels in the dorsal hippocampus in control rats. In rats exposed to VPA, the second-generation antipsychotic OLZ reduces memory-related and neuroplastic alterations. The current findings support the use of OLZ in this illness and further validate the use of prenatal VPA as a model of ASD.

AB  - Integrin alpha v beta 6 holds promise as a therapeutic target for organ fibrosis, yet targeted therapies are hampered by concerns over inflammatory-related side effects. The role of alpha v beta 6 in renal inflammation remains unknown, and clarifying this issue is crucial for alpha v beta 6-targeted treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here, we revealed a remarkable positive correlation between overexpressed alpha v beta 6 in proximal tubule cells (PTCs) and renal inflammation in CKD patients and mouse models. Notably, knockout of alpha v beta 6 not only significantly alleviated renal fibrosis but also reduced inflammatory responses in mice, especially the infiltration of pro-inflammatory macrophages. Furthermore, conditional knockout of alpha v beta 6 in PTCs in vivo and co-culture of PTCs with macrophages in vitro showed that depleting alpha v beta 6 in PTCs suppressed the migration and pro-inflammatory differentiation of macrophages. Screening of macrophage activators showed that alpha v beta 6 in PTCs activates macrophages via secreting IL-34. IL-34 produced by PTCs was significantly diminished by alpha v beta 6 silencing, and reintroduction of IL-34 restored macrophage activities, while anti-IL-34 antibody restrained macrophage activities enhanced by alpha v beta 6 overexpression. Moreover, RNA-sequencing of PTCs and verification experiments demonstrated that silencing alpha v beta 6 in PTCs blocked hypoxia-stimulated IL-34 upregulation and secretion by inhibiting YAP expression, dephosphorylation, and nuclear translocation, which resulted in the activation of Hippo signaling. While application of a YAP agonist effectively recurred IL-34 production by PTCs, enhancing the subsequent macrophage migration and activation. Besides, reduced IL-34 expression and YAP activation were also observed in global or PTCs-specific alpha v beta 6-deficient injured kidneys. Collectively, our research elucidates the pro-inflammatory function and YAP/IL-34/macrophage axis-mediated mechanism of alpha v beta 6 in renal inflammation, providing a solid rationale for the use of alpha v beta 6 inhibition to treat kidney inflammation and fibrosis.

AB  - Oxidative stress is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by brain atrophy, amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and loss of neurons. 8-Oxoguanine, a major oxidatively generated nucleobase highly accumulated in the AD brain, is known to cause neurodegeneration. In mammalian cells, several enzymes play essential roles in minimizing the 8-oxoguanine accumulation in DNA. MUTYH with adenine DNA glycosylase activity excises adenine inserted opposite 8-oxoguanine in DNA. MUTYH is reported to actively contribute to the neurodegenerative process in Parkinson and Huntington diseases and some mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases by accelerating neuronal dysfunction and microgliosis under oxidative conditions; however, whether or not MUTYH is involved in AD pathogenesis remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the contribution of MUTYH to the AD pathogenesis. Using postmortem human brains, we showed that various types of MUTYH transcripts and proteins are expressed in most hippocampal neurons and glia in both non-AD and AD brains. We further introduced MUTYH deficiency into App(NL-G-F/NL-G-F) knock-in AD model mice, which produce humanized toxic amyloid-beta without the overexpression of APP protein, and investigated the effects of MUTYH deficiency on the behavior, pathology, gene expression, and neurogenesis. MUTYH deficiency improved memory impairment in App(NL-G-F/NL-G-F) mice, accompanied by reduced microgliosis. Gene expression profiling strongly suggested that MUTYH is involved in the microglial response pathways under AD pathology and contributes to the phagocytic activity of disease-associated microglia. We also found that MUTYH deficiency ameliorates impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus, thus improving memory impairment. In conclusion, we propose that MUTYH, which is expressed in the hippocampus of AD patients as well as non-AD subjects, actively contributes to memory impairment by inducing microgliosis with poor neurogenesis in the preclinical AD phase and that MUTYH is a novel therapeutic target for AD, as its deficiency is highly beneficial for ameliorating AD pathogenesis.

AB  - The closed-loop control of pathological brain activity is a challenging task. In this study, we investigated the sensitivity of continuous epileptiform short discharge generation to electrical stimulation applied at different phases between the discharges using an in vitro 4-AP-based model of epilepsy in rat hippocampal slices. As a measure of stimulation effectiveness, we introduced a sensitivity function, which we then measured in experiments and analyzed with different biophysical and abstract mathematical models, namely, (i) the two-order subsystem of our previous Epileptor-2 model, describing short discharge generation governed by synaptic resource dynamics; (ii) a similar model governed by shunting conductance dynamics (Epileptor-2B); (iii) the stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)-like model applied for the network; (iv) the LIF model with potassium M-channels (LIF+KM), belonging to Class II of excitability; and (v) the Epileptor-2B model with after-spike depolarization. A semi-analytic method was proposed for calculating the interspike interval (ISI) distribution and the sensitivity function in LIF and LIF+KM models, which provided parametric analysis. Sensitivity was found to increase with phase for all models except the last one. The Epileptor-2B model is favored over other models for subthreshold oscillations in the presence of large noise, based on the comparison of ISI statistics and sensitivity functions with experimental data. This study also emphasizes the stochastic nature of epileptiform discharge generation and the greater effectiveness of closed-loop stimulation in later phases of ISIs.

AB  - Introduction Widespread use of antibiotics has led to an increase in bacterial multiple drug resistance, thereby searching for natural antimicrobial agents from plants becomes an effective and alternative approach. In the present study, we selected six foodborne bacteria to evaluate the antibacterial activities of 12 medicinal plants ethyl acetate (EA) extracts. Objective This study aims to search for natural antibiotic substitutes from plant extracts. The antibacterial components were further discussed through chemometric and mass spectroscopic analyses. Methodology Agar well diffusion and the microdilution methods were used to test the antibacterial activity. Total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) were used to judge the active phytochemicals. To further characterise the potential antibacterial components, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) coupled with Pearson correlation and feature-based molecular network (FBMN) were proposed. Results Most of the plant extracts possessed antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella typhi. Toona sinensis shoots and Firmiana simplex barks showed high inhibitory activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella dysenteriae, and Escherichia coli strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 1.56, 0.78, and 0.39 mg/mL, respectively. Salmonella typhi was highly sensitive to Firmiana simplex barks with an inhibitory diameter up to 21.67 +/- 0.95 mm, and MIC at 0.78 mg/mL. Moreover, Toona sinensis shoots and Firmiana simplex barks had the highest TPCs. Conclusion Our results indicated that Toona sinensis shoots, Koelreuteria paniculate seeds, and Firmiana simplex barks could be supplied as potential sources of antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, 36 potential bioactive compounds were identified mainly as polyphenols, glycosides, and terpenoids.

AB  - Pneumonia causes short- and long-term cognitive dysfunction in a high proportion of patients, although the mechanism(s) responsible for this effect are unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that pneumonia-elicited cytotoxic amyloid and tau variants: (1) are present in the circulation during infection; (2) lead to impairment of long-term potentiation; and, (3) inhibit long-term potentiation dependent upon tau. Cytotoxic amyloid and tau species were recovered from the blood and the hippocampus following pneumonia, and they were present in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation oxygenators of patients with pneumonia, especially in those who died. Introduction of immunopurified blood-borne amyloid and tau into either the airways or the blood of uninfected animals acutely and chronically impaired hippocampal information processing. In contrast, the infection did not impair long-term potentiation in tau knockout mice and the amyloid- and tau-dependent disruption in hippocampal signaling was less severe in tau knockout mice. Moreover, the infection did not elicit cytotoxic amyloid and tau variants in tau knockout mice. Therefore, pneumonia initiates a tauopathy that contributes to cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Introduction Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation. These factors can lead to the overactivation of c-JNK and p38MAPK.Methods In rats, stereotactic intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of propionic acid (PPA) results in autistic-like characteristics such as poor social interaction, repetitive behaviours, and restricted communication. Research has demonstrated the beneficial effects of phytochemicals derived from plants in treating neurological disorders. Tanshinone-IIA (Tan-IIA) is a chemical found in the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza. It has neuroprotective potential by inhibiting c-JNK and p38MAPK against behavioral and neurochemical alterations in PPA-induced autistic rats. We observe behavioral changes, alterations in apoptotic markers, myelin basic protein (MBP), neurofilament-Light (NEFL), inflammatory cytokines, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotransmitter imbalances using different brain regions (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum), as well as biological samples, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and blood plasma.Results Persistent administration of 30 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg Tan-IIA via intraperitoneal injection reduced these alterations dose-dependently. Anisomycin (3 mg/kg.,i.p.) as a SAPK (c-JNK and p38MAPK) agonist was administered to assess the neuroprotective effect of Tan-IIA in autistic rats. Tan-IIA's molecular interactions with c-JNK and p38MAPK were confirmed using silico analysis. We also observed gross morphological, histopathological, and Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) myelin straining changes in whole and coronal brain sections.Conclusion Thus, Tan-IIA has a neuroprotective potential by inhibiting the c-JNK and p38MAPK signalling pathways, which reduces the behavioral and neurochemical abnormalities induced by PPA in adult Wistar rats, indicating that current results should be studied further for the diagnosis and treatment of autism.

AB  - Intracellular Ca2+ signals are key for the regulation of cellular processes ranging from myocyte contraction, hormonal secretion, neural transmission, cellular metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and cell proliferation. Measurement of cellular Ca2+ is routinely performed using fluorescence microscopy with biological indicators. Analysis of deterministic signals is reasonably straightforward as relevant data can be discriminated based on the timing of cellular responses. However, analysis of stochastic, slower oscillatory events, as well as rapid subcellular Ca2+ responses, takes considerable time and effort which often includes visual analysis by trained investigators, especially when studying signals arising from cells embedded in complex tissues. The purpose of the current study was to determine if full-frame time-series and line-scan image analysis workflow of Fluo-4 generated Ca2+ fluorescence data from vascular myocytes could be automated without introducing errors. This evaluation was addressed by re-analyzing a published "gold standard" full-frame time-series dataset through visual analysis of Ca2+ signals from recordings made in pulmonary arterial myocytes of en face arterial preparations. We applied a combination of data driven and statistical approaches with comparisons to our published data to assess the fidelity of the various approaches. Regions of interest with Ca2+ oscillations were detected automatically post hoc using the LCPro plug-in for ImageJ. Oscillatory signals were separated based on event durations between 4 and 40 s. These data were filtered based on cutoffs obtained from multiple methods and compared to the published manually curated "gold standard" dataset. Subcellular focal and rapid Ca2+ "spark" events from line-scan recordings were examined using SparkLab 5.8, which is a custom automated detection and analysis program. After filtering, the number of true positives, false positives, and false negatives were calculated through comparisons to visually derived "gold standard" datasets. Positive predictive value, sensitivity, and false discovery rates were calculated. There were very few significant differences between the automated and manually curated results with respect to quality of the oscillatory and Ca2+ spark events, and there were no systematic biases in the data curation or filtering techniques. The lack of statistical difference in event quality between manual data curation and statistically derived critical cutoff techniques leads us to believe that automated analysis techniques can be reliably used to analyze spatial and temporal aspects to Ca2+ imaging data, which will improve experiment workflow.

AB  - The concept of episodic memory (EM) faces significant challenges by two claims: EM might not be a distinct memory system, and EM might be an epiphenomenon of a more general capacity for mental time travel (MTT). Nevertheless, the observations leading to these arguments do not preclude the existence of a mechanically and functionally distinct EM system. First, modular systems, like cognition, can have distinct subsystems that may not be distinguishable in the system's final output. EM could be such a subsystem, even though its effects may be difficult to distinguish from those of other subsystems. Second, EM could have a distinct and consistent low-level function, which is used in diverse high-level functions such as MTT. This article introduces the scenario construction framework, proposing that EM crucially rests on memory traces containing the gist of an episodic experience. During retrieval, EM traces trigger the reconstruction of semantic representations, which were active during the remembered episode, and are further enriched with semantic information, to generate a scenario of the past experience. This conceptualization of EM is consistent with studies on the neural basis of EM and resolves the two challenges while retaining the key properties associated with EM. This article is part of the theme issue 'Elements of episodic memory: lessons from 40 years of research'.

AB  - IntroductionHeroin use disorder (HUD) is a seriously increasing health issue, accounting for most deaths among drug abusers. Studying non-coding ribonucleic acid gene expression among drug abusers is a promising approach, as it may be used in diagnosis and therapeutics.Participants and methodsA total of 49 male heroin-dependent patients and 49 male control participants were recruited from Kasr Al Ainy Psychiatry and Addiction outpatient clinics, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University. Sera were gathered. qRT-PCR was utilized for the detection of gene expression of non-coding RNAs such as "HOX transcript antisense RNA" (HOTAIR), micro-RNA (miRNA-206), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and Activity Regulated Cytoskeleton Associated Protein (Arc). Sera Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels were assessed using ELISA. Using a western blot made it possible to determine the protein expression of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR.ResultsThe study demonstrated that gene expressions of HOTAIR, AKT, PI3K, and Arc were considerably lowered between cases and controls, while gene expressions of miR-206 and mTOR1 were significantly raised. PI3K and AKT protein expressions were downregulated, while mTOR expressions were upregulated. BDNF levels were significantly decreased in some cases.ConclusionThe results of this study suggest that decreased HOTAIR in HUD relieves miR-206 inhibition, which thus increases and affects downstream PI3K/AKT/mTOR, ARC, and BDNF expression. This may be shared in addictive and relapsing behaviors.

AB  - Contact unmodified antisense DNA biotechnology (CUADb), developed in 2008, employs short antisense DNA oligonucleotides (oligos) as a novel approach to insect pest control. These oligonucleotide-based insecticides target pest mature rRNAs and/or pre-rRNAs and have demonstrated high insecticidal efficacy, particularly against sap-feeding insect pests, which are key vectors of plant DNA viruses and among the most economically damaging herbivorous insects. To further explore the potential of CUADb, this study evaluated the insecticidal efficacy of short 11-mer antisense DNA oligos against Coccus hesperidum, in comparison with long 56-mer single-stranded and double-stranded DNA sequences. The short oligos exhibited higher insecticidal activity. By day 9, the highest mortality rate (97.66 +/- 4.04%) was recorded in the Coccus-11 group, while the most effective long sequence was the double-stranded DNA in the dsCoccus-56 group (77.09 +/- 6.24%). This study also describes the architecture of the DNA containment (DNAc) mechanism, highlighting the intricate interactions between rRNAs and various types of DNA oligos. During DNAc, the Coccus-11 treatment induced enhanced ribosome biogenesis and ATP production through a metabolic shift from carbohydrates to lipid-based energy synthesis. However, this ultimately led to a 'kinase disaster' due to widespread kinase downregulation resulting from insufficient ATP levels. All DNA oligos with high or moderate complementarity to target rRNA initiated hypercompensation, but subsequent substantial rRNA degradation and insect mortality occurred only when the oligo sequence perfectly matched the rRNA. Both short and long oligonucleotide insecticide treatments led to a 3.75-4.25-fold decrease in rRNA levels following hypercompensation, which was likely mediated by a DNA-guided rRNase, such as RNase H1, while crucial enzymes of RNAi (DICER1, Argonaute 2, and DROSHA) were downregulated, indicating fundamental difference in molecular mechanisms of DNAc and RNAi. Consistently, significant upregulation of RNase H1 was detected in the Coccus-11 treatment group. In contrast, treatment with random DNA oligos resulted in only a 2-3-fold rRNA decrease, consistent with the normal rRNA half-life maintained by general ribonucleases. These findings reveal a fundamental new mechanism of rRNA regulation via complementary binding between exogenous unmodified antisense DNA and cellular rRNA. From a practical perspective, this minimalist approach, applying short antisense DNA dissolved in water, offers an effective, eco-friendly and innovative solution for managing sternorrhynchans and other insect pests. The results introduce a promising new concept in crop protection: DNA-programmable insect pest control.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the value of resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on the brain extraction tool (BET) algorithm in evaluating the cranial nerve function of patients with delirium in intensive care unit (ICU). A total of 100 patients with delirium in hospital were studied, and 20 healthy volunteers were used as control. All the subjects were examined by MRI, and the images were analyzed by the BET algorithm, and the convolution neural network (CNN) algorithm was introduced for comparison. The application effects of the two algorithms were analyzed, and the differences of brain nerve function between delirium patients and normal people were explored. The results showed that the root mean square error, high frequency error norm, and structural similarity of the BET algorithm were 70.4%, 71.5%, and 0.92, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of the CNN algorithm (P < 0.05). Compared with normal people, the ReHo values of pontine, hippocampus (right), cerebellum (left), midbrain, and basal ganglia in delirium patients were significantly higher. ReHo values of frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, parietal lobe, and temporal lobe and anisotropy scores (FA) of cerebellums (left), frontal lobe, temporal lobe (left), corpus callosum, and hippocampus (left) decreased significantly. The average diffusivity (MD) of medial frontal lobe, superior temporal gyrus (right), the first half of cingulate gyrus, bilateral insula, and caudate nucleus (left) increased significantly (P < 0.05). MRI based on the deep learning algorithm can effectively improve the image quality, which is valuable in evaluating the brain nerve function of delirium patients. Abnormal brain structure damage and abnormal function can be used to help diagnose delirium.

AB  - Breast cancer has become the most common form of cancer among women. In recent years, deep learning has shown great potential in aiding the diagnosis of pathological images, particularly through the use of convolutional neural networks for locating lymph node metastasis under gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). However, the massive size of these images at the highest magnification introduces redundant computation during the inference process. Additionally, the diversity of biological textures and structures within WSIs can cause confusion for classifiers, particularly in identifying hard examples. As a result, the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency remains a critical issue for whole-slide image metastasis localization. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream network that takes a pair of low-and high-magnification image patches as input for identifying hard examples during the training phase. Specifically, our framework focuses on samples where the outputs of the two magnification networks are dissimilar. We adopt a dual magnification hard mining loss to re-weight the ambiguous samples. To more efficiently locate tumor metastasis cells in whole slide images, the two stream networks are decomposed into a cascaded network during the inference phase. The low magnification WSIs scanned by the low-mag network generate a coarse probability map, and the suspicious areas in the map are refined by the high-mag network. Finally, we evaluate our fast location dual magnification hard example mining network on the Camelyon16 breast cancer whole-slide image dataset. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a 0.871 FROC score with a faster inference time, and our high magnification network also achieves a 0.88 FROC score.

AB  - Existing pharmacological treatments for mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) offer limited effectiveness and adverse side effects. Transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) utilizing ultrashort ultrasound pulses reaches deep brain regions and may circumvent conductivity issues associated with brain stimulation. This study addresses the gap in TPS research for mild NCD during a critical intervention period before irreversible cognitive degradation. Our objective was to explore the effectiveness and tolerability of TPS in older adults with mild NCD. In an open-label study, 17 older adults (including 10 females and 7 males) with mild NCD underwent TPS for two weeks with three sessions per week. Cognitive evaluations and fMRI scans were conducted pre- and post-intervention. The results indicated changes in functional connectivity in key brain regions, correlating with cognitive improvement at B = 0.087 (CI, 0.007-0.167; p = 0.038). However, cortical thickness measurements showed no significant differences. Here we show that TPS can enhance cognitive function within mild NCD. This proof-of-concept study suggests that TPS has potential as a non-invasive therapy used to attenuate cognitive decline, encouraging further investigation in larger randomized trials. The findings could influence clinical practice by introducing TPS as an adjunctive treatment option and potentially impact policy by promoting its inclusion in new treatment strategies for mild NCD.

AB  - Nanobodies (Nbs) are single domain antibody fragments derived from heavy-chain antibodies found in members of the Camelidae family. They have become a relevant class of biomolecules for many different applications because of several important advantages such as their small size, high solubility and stability, and low production costs. On the other hand, synthetic Nb libraries are emerging as an attractive alternative to animal immunization for the selection of antigen-specific Nbs. Here, we present the design and construction of a new synthetic nanobody library using the phage display technology, following a structure-based approach in which the three hypervariable loops were subjected to position-specific randomization schemes. The constructed library has a clonal diversity of 10(8) and an amino acid variability that matches the codon distribution set by design at each randomized position. We have explored the capabilities of the new library by selecting nanobodies specific for three antigens: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the glycoprotein complex (GnGc) of Andes virus. To test the potential of the library to yield a variety of antigen-specific Nbs, we introduced a biopanning strategy consisting of a single selection round using stringent conditions. Using this approach, we obtained several binders for each of the target antigens. The constructed library represents a promising nanobody source for different applications.

AB  - Simple Summary: African elephants are highly social animals that perform a so-called Greeting Ceremony in the wild when meeting elephants they are familiar with but have not seen for a certain timespan. Until now, it has not been known whether zoo elephants also show this unique behaviour. Therefore, this study was designed around the reunifications of two mother-daughter pairs that had been separated for 2 and 12 years, and two unifications of unrelated elephants, as a comparison. First contact was conducted in a protected setting, i.e., there was a fence between the animals to prevent possible fighting. Signs of the Greeting Ceremony shown by the elephants, the distance they kept to the separating fence, and the time until the elephants' trunks touched for the first time were observed. The results demonstrate that the related elephants showed all behavioural characteristic of the Greeting Ceremony, kept close to the fence, and touched trunks after only a few seconds, while elephants that were not familiar with each other did not show a full Greeting Ceremony, stayed further from the fence, and touched trunks for the first time only after several minutes upon meeting. This study testifies that zoo elephants show the same typical social behaviour known from wild elephants (namely the Greeting Ceremony) and, therefore, behave species-specific. It also confirms the strong family bonds of elephants and the cognitive abilities of elephants, specifically their long-term social memory.
   & nbsp;</p>
   The introduction of elephants into new groups is necessary for breeding programmes. However, behavioural studies on the reactions of these animals at first encounters are missing. In the present study, female African elephants (Loxodonta africana) living in zoos were observed during unifications with unfamiliar elephants (introduction of two to one females and one to two females; n = 6) and reunifications with related elephants (two mother-daughter-pairs; n = 4) that were separated for 2 and 12 years, respectively. First encounters of the elephants were observed and recorded by scan sampling. The parameters measured were (a) signs of the characteristic Greeting Ceremony, (b) distance to the fence separating the elephants during first contact, and (c) time until trunks touched for the first time. The data were statistically analysed with SPSS. The results showed that related elephants performed a full Greeting Ceremony on reunifications. Unrelated elephants only expressed a minor greeting. During first encounters, related elephants predominantly showed affiliative behaviour (p = 0.001), whilst unrelated elephants expressed more agonistic behaviour (p = 0.001). The distance to the fence was significantly smaller for related elephants than for unrelated elephants (p = 0.038). first contact of trunks occurred on average after 3.00 s. in related elephants and 1026.25 s. in unrelated elephants. These findings indicate that related elephants recognise their kin after up to 12 years of separation, meet them with a full Greeting Ceremony during reunification, and seek contact to the related elephant, while unrelated elephants are hesitant during unifications with unfamiliar elephants and express more agonistic behaviour. The results testify that zoo elephants show the same species-specific social behaviour as their conspecifics in the wild. It also confirms the cognitive abilities of elephants and the significance of matrilines for breeding programmes.</p>

AB  - This study was aimed to determine the neuroprotective influence of Stellaria media in terms of restoring normal state of the rat's hippocampus and cortex after oxidative insult caused by in vitro ischemia and reperfusion. Cell viability and membrane integrity were assessed using MTT and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, respectively. Ischemic insult was introduced in the rat brain's hippocampal and cortical slivers by exposing oxygen and glucose deficiency (OGD) for 2 h, followed by 1 h of re-perfusion. Cellular oxidative stress levels were quantified by incorporating 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate fluorescent probes. Additionally, the lipid peroxidation was assessed using TBARS assay. Findings revealed significant neuro-protection against OGD-induced mitochondrial impairment at 40 mg/mL of S. media in rat's hippocampal and cortical slices. The LDH levels were decreased significantly (P < 0.001) during pre-incubation and reoxy-genation periods using varied concentrations of S. media extract. Cellular oxidative stress levels results showed significant (P < 0.001) reduction in dichlorofluorescein fluorescence in slices homogenate of hip-pocampus and cortex using S. media extract. The lipid peroxidation assay results showed decreased (P < 0.01) levels of malondialdehyde in liver tissues of treated rats treated (200 mg/kg body weight) when compared to the ischemic animal. In summary, findings clearly indicated the neuroprotective effects of extract against in vitro ischemia in brain hippocampal and cortex slivers. S. media could undoubtedly be utilized as a healing agent in preventing neuronal cells' loss during ischemic-reperfusion process. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Neurosteroids are steroids produced by endocrine glands and subsequently entering the brain, and also include steroids synthesis in the brain. It has been widely known that neurosteroids influence many neurological functions, including neuronal signaling, synaptic adaptations, and neuroprotective effects. In addition, abnormality in the synthesis and function of neurosteroids has been closely linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia (SZ), and epilepsy. Given their important role in brain pathophysiology and disorders, neurosteroids offer potential therapeutic targets for a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases, and that therapeutic strategies targeting neurosteroids probably exert beneficial effects. We therefore summarized the role of neurosteroids in brain physiology and neuropsychiatric disorders, and introduced the recent findings of synthetic neurosteroid analogues for potential treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, thereby providing insights for further research in the future.

The structural and morphological characteristics of the resulting materials were determined using several techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The maximum removal efficiency of methylene blue (MB) by BNPs Fe/Ni and Fe/Cu materials was found to be 88.60% and 91.06%, respectively, at a concentration of MB = 25 mg.l(-1) and 25 degrees C. According to the results of the kinetic modeling study, the adsorption process of MB on the two BNPs materials followed second-order kinetics, with the maximum adsorption capacities of MB on Fe/Ni and Fe/Cu BNPs being 26.94 mg.g(-1)and 28.00 mg.g(-1), respectively.

AB  - Introduction Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and a reduction in hippocampal neurotrophins, in which trimethytin (TMT) infusion causes tangles and neuronal dysfunction, creating an AD-like model in rats. Previous studies have demonstrated that crocin, which has anti-inflammatory properties, can enhance learning, memory acquisition, and cognitive behavior. This study aimed to assess the combined impact of aerobic exercise and crocin on memory, learning, and hippocampal Tau and neurotrophins gene expression in AD-like model rats.Methods Forty male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: (1) healthy control, (2) Alzheimer's control, (3) endurance training, (4) crocin consumption, and (5) endurance training + crocin. Alzheimer's induction was achieved in groups 2-5 through intraperitoneal injection of 8 mg/kg TMT. Rats in groups 3 and 5 engaged in treadmill running three sessions per week, 15-30 min per session, at a speed of 15-20 m/min for eight weeks, and groups 4 and 5 received daily crocin supplementation of 25 mg/kg.Results Alzheimer's induction with TMT showed significant reduction in memory, learning, NGF, BDNF, and TrkB gene expression, and increase in tau gene expression (all p < 0.05). Notably, endurance training and crocin consumption separately significantly increased memory, learning, NGF, BDNF, and TrkB gene expression while significantly decreasing tau gene expression (all p < 0.05). Importantly, combined endurance training with crocin yielded the most profound effects on memory (p = 0.001), NGF (p = 0.002), BDNF (p = 0.001), and TrkB (p = 0.003) gene expression (p < 0.005), as well as a reduction in tau gene expression (p = 0.001).Conclusion These findings underscore the possible impact of endurance training, particularly when coupled with crocin, on enhancing memory, learning, and neurotrophin gene expression and reducing tau gene expression in Alzheimer's rats. These results highlight the possibility of synergistic interventions for improved therapeutic outcomes.

AB  - <bold>Introduction:</bold> Pubertal maturation is marked by significant changes in stress-induced hormonal responses mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, with prepubertal male and female rats often exhibiting greater HPA reactivity compared to adult males and females. Though the implications of these changes are unclear, elevated stress responsiveness might contribute to the stress-related vulnerabilities often associated with puberty. <bold>Methods:</bold> The current experiments sought to determine whether differences in cellular activation, as measured by FOS immunohistochemistry, or excitatory ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit expression, as measured by qRT-PCR, in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) were associated with these noted pubertal shifts in stress reactivity in male and female rats. As the PVN is the key nucleus responsible for activating the hormonal stress response, we predicted greater cellular activation and higher expression levels of glutamate receptor subunits in the PVN of prepubertal males and females compared to their adult counterparts. <bold>Results:</bold> Our FOS data revealed that while prepubertal males showed greater stress-induced activation in the PVN than adult males, prepubertal females showed less activation than adult females. Moreover, many of the NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptor subunits measured, including Grin1, Grin2b, Gria1, Gria2, Grik1, and Grik2, had higher expression levels in adults, particularly in males. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Though not supporting our initial predictions, these data do indicate that age and stress influence the activation of the PVN and the expression of glutamate receptor subunits important in its function. These data also suggest that the effects of age and stress are different in males and females. Though still far from a clear understanding of what mechanism(s) mediate pubertal shift in stress reactivity, these data add to our growing understanding of how age, stress, and sex influence HPA function.

AB  - Motivated by the recent synthesis of a new polymorph of germanium selenide (gamma-GeSe) with a honeycomb lattice and an astonishingly high conductivity (even higher than graphite), here we conduct a study on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalytic performance and electronic properties of gamma-GeSe with respect to the thickness effect from monolayer (1L) to trilayer (3L), along with the defect effect. The band structure of gamma-GeSe exhibits a camel's back-like structure near the Gamma point, existing for all the layers and in the presence of dilute Se vacancy and surface adsorbate like the Pt atom, and a narrow bandgap ranging from 0.544 eV for 1L to 0.252 eV for 3L. We find that pristine gamma-GeSe is electrocatalytically inert for all the layers with an endothermic uptake of hydrogen, as indicated by the calculated Gibbs free energy (Delta G(H)). However, upon introduction of Se vacancies and surface Pt adsorbates, the HER performance is enhanced, with the HER activity of 1L gamma-GeSe surpassing those of bilayer (2L) and 3L gamma-GeSe. Moreover, an increase in defect concentration and thickness leads to a decrease in bandgap, developing semimetallic characteristics. With the absence of a transition element and solely s and p orbitals, semimetallic gamma-GeSe is unique and holds great promise as a support for fabricating a single atomic catalyst for HER, and our work offers valuable insights into the rational design of 2D electrocatalysts.

AB  - Enzymatic hydrolysis using pectinase is critical for producing high-yield and quality sea buckthorn juice. This study determined the optimal temperature, time, and enzyme dosage combinations to guide manufacturers. A temperature of 60 degrees C, hydrolysis time of 3 h, and 0.3% enzyme dosage gave 64.1% juice yield-25% higher than without enzymes. Furthermore, monitoring physicochemical properties reveals enzyme impacts on composition. Higher dosages increase soluble solids up to 15% and soluble fiber content by 35% through cell wall breakdown. However, excessive amounts over 0.3% decrease yields. Pectin concentration also declines dose-dependently, falling by 91% at 0.4%, improving juice stability but needing modulation to retain viscosity. Electrochemical fingerprinting successfully differentiates process conditions, offering a rapid quality control tool. Its potential for commercial inline use during enzymatic treatment requires exploration. Overall, connecting optimized parameters to measured effects provides actionable insights for manufacturers to boost yields, determine enzyme impacts on nutrition/functionality, and introduce novel process analytical technology. Further investigations of health properties using these conditions could expand sea buckthorn juice functionality.

AB  - The size of tusks in proboscideans has numerous implications for their function, biology, ecology, and other aspects of both extant and extinct species. Yet, no prior studies have explored the relationship between the linear dimensions of tusks and their corresponding masses. Here, methods for estimating the masses of proboscidean tusks based on their length and circumference are introduced for the first time. Through extensive regression analysis on a large dataset of tusk dimensions and recorded masses, a robust regression equation was developed. Additionally, it was found that converting tusk volume to kilograms using the cylinder formula yielded highly accurate tusk mass estimates in proboscideans. Also, the potential average tusk sizes of living elephant species under optimal conditions, before the devastating impact of humans, were estimated. The upper incisors of proboscideans remained relatively small until the Late Miocene when tusk sizes comparable to those of living elephants first appeared. Mammoths, along with certain mammutids, stegodonts, and anancines, developed notably larger tusks relative to their body size compared to extant elephants. The largest tusks were identified in derived Plio-Pleistocene proboscideans within Mammuthus, Palaeoloxodon, and Mammutidae clades, with some species bearing tusks weighing above 200 kg per side. World record-sized tusks far surpassed this figure.

AB  - Introduction: Neurosteroids have a variety of neurological functions, such as neurite growth, neuroprotection, myelination, and neurogenesis. P450scc, encoded by CYP11A1 gene, is the cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis. In this study, we examine the dendritic morphology in developing hippocampal neurons of Cyp11a1 null mice at P15, a critical period for synapse formation and maturation. Methods: Knockout mice were maintained until P15 with hormone administration. The Golgi-Cox method stained CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus to reveal dendritic morphology. Results: We demonstrated that Cyp11a1 null mice usually die within 7 days after birth and thus collected brain samples at postnatal day 5 (P5) for examination. There was significant shrinkage of dendrite size and diminishment of dendritic branching in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus of Cyp11a1 null mice, suggesting a developmental delay. We wonder if this delay may catch up later in life. Since the age of P15 is a critical period for synapse formation and maturation, the Cyp11a1 null mice were rescued by receiving hormone administration until P15 that the dendritic morphology in the developing hippocampal neurons could be examined. The results indicated that the total dendritic length, the number of dendritic branches, as well as dendritic arborization in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons are significantly decreased in P15 knockout mice when compared to the wild type. The spine densities were also significantly decreased. In addition, the Western blot analysis revealed decreased PSD-95 expression levels in the knockout mice compared to the wild type at P15. Conclusion: These results suggested that Cyp11a1 deficiency impairs the dendritic structures in the developing hippocampal pyramidal neurons.

AB  - Simple Summary Type 2 diabetes can lead to catastrophic complications, including neurodegeneration and memory impairment. Therefore, it is essential to identify effective therapeutic strategies to improve blood glucose levels and prevent the onset of complications. This study evidently showcases environmental enrichment as an effective therapy for preserving mental health in diet-induced type 2 diabetic rats. The outcomes of this study can be translated to clinical trials in diabetic patients. Environmental enrichment can be introduced as one of the alternative therapies for preventing diabetes in pre-diabetic individuals and in established diabetes alongside metformin or other hypoglycemic pharmacotherapy. Background: The Western-style diet-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) may eventually trigger neurodegeneration and memory impairment. Thus, it is essential to identify effective therapeutic strategies to overcome T2D complications. This study aimed to investigate the effects of environmental enrichment (EE) and metformin interventions on metabolic dysfunctions, hippocampal neuronal death, and hippocampal-dependent memory impairments in high-fat/high-sucrose (HFS) diet-induced T2D rats. Methods: Thirty-two male rats (200-250 g) were divided into four groups: C group (standard diet + conventional cage); D group (HFS diet + conventional cage); DE group (HFS diet + EE cage/6hr daily); and DM group (HFS diet + metformin + conventional cage). Body weight was measured every week. T-maze tasks, anthropometric, biochemical, histological, and morphometric parameters were measured. The expression changes of hippocampal genes were also analyzed. Results: The anthropometric and biochemical parameters were improved in DE and DM groups compared with the D group. DE and DM groups had significantly higher T-maze percentages than the D group. These groups also had better histological and morphometric parameters than the D group. The interventions of EE and metformin enhanced the expression of hippocampal genes related to neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity (BDNF/TrkB binding, PI3K-Akt, Ras-MAPK, PLC gamma-Ca2+, and LTP). Conclusion: Environmental enrichment (EE) and metformin improved metabolic functions, hippocampal neuron survival, and hippocampal-dependent memory in HFS diet-induced T2D rats. The underlying mechanisms of these interventions involved the expression of genes that regulate neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity.

AB  - The complex growth patterns of Camellia oleifera fruits in natural environments pose significant challenges for harvesting robots. Conventional solutions often rely on complex 3D point cloud processing to detect these growth patterns and enable robotic harvesting. In this study, a method for recognizing the growth patterns of Camellia oleifera fruits in 2D images is proposed. To address the challenges of precise posture detection, the fruits are categorized into five types based on their growth patterns: Front, Up, Down, Left, and Right. Occluded fruits are classified separately, and a dedicated dataset for posture recognition is created. Furthermore, a posture detection model, CO-YOLO, based on the YOLO11n architecture, is introduced. The Multi-scale Aggregation Attention (MMA) module replaces the original C3f2 module, enabling the fusion of feature information across multiple scales, which enhances the model's perceptual capabilities and improves posture recognition accuracy. Additionally, the Depth Pointwise Convolutional (DPW) module is introduced to replace standard convolutions in the backbone and neck networks, enabling better fusion of channel features, enhancing the representation of posture features in the target region, and reducing the number of parameters. Experimental results show that CO-YOLO achieves a precision of 90.6 %, a recall of 87.0 %, and an mAP@0.5 of 93.7 %. Compared to YOLO11s, CO-YOLO reduces model size and computational complexity by 77.1 % and 69.9 %, respectively, while improving mAP@0.5 by 4.8 %. Compared to YOLOv7-tiny, YOLOv9s, and YOLOv10s, CO-YOLO achieves increases in mAP@0.5 of 3.9 %, 5.6 %, and 5.5 %, respectively. Heatmaps generated by CO-YOLO and YOLO11n indicate that these enhancements significantly improve posture recognition. In summary, the CO-YOLO model exhibits strong performance and provides valuable insights for advancing fruit-picking robotics.

AB  - Motivation Swine leukocyte antigens (SLAs) (i.e. swine major histocompatibility complex proteins) conduct a fundamental role in swine immunity. To generate a protective vaccine across an outbred species, such as pigs, it is critical that epitopes that bind to diverse SLA alleles are used in the vaccine development process. We introduced a new strategy for epitope prediction.Results We employed molecular dynamics simulation to identify key amino acids for interactions with epitopes. We developed an algorithm wherein each SLA-1 is compared to a crystalized reference allele with unique weighting for non-conserved amino acids based on R group and position. We then performed homology modeling and electrostatic contact mapping to visualize how relatively small changes in sequences impacted the charge distribution in the binding site. We selected eight diverse SLA-1 alleles and performed homology modeling followed, by protein-peptide docking and binding affinity analyses, to identify porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus matrix protein epitopes that bind with high affinity to these alleles. We also performed docking analysis on the epitopes identified as strong binders using NetMHCpan 4.1. Epitopes predicted to bind to our eight SLA-1 alleles had equivalent or higher energetic interactions than those predicted to bind to the NetMHCpan 4.1 allele repertoire. This approach of selecting diverse SLA-1 alleles, followed by homology modeling, and docking simulations, can be used as a novel strategy for epitope prediction that complements other available tools and is especially useful when available tools do not offer a prediction for SLAs/major histocompatibility complex.Availability and implementation The data underlying this article are available in the online .

AB  - Mediterranean farmers are searching for low input and alternative crops for cropping systems diversification and for promoting innovative value chains. Since there are still limited studies on camelina to be introduced under real on-farm conditions, a multilocation trial was conducted in four different sites of inland areas of Tuscany (central Italy) with the aim of evaluating camelina productive potential and seed quality, thus defining a complete metabolomic profile. A remarkable variability has been observed on seed and oil yield, fatty acids profile and accumulation of secondary metabolites (SMs), particularly polyphenols, gamma-tocopherol, and glucosinolates, highlighting how their accumulation is strongly influenced by environmental conditions. In particular, significant correlations have been found among air temperatures and SMs a accumulation, indicating that this element of weather could represent the best predictor for secondary metabolites in camelina seeds. So, this study aimed to demonstrate the interesting opportunity that camelina could represent for Mediterranean farmers, being a good source of oil, essential fatty acids, and bioactive compounds, thus representing a potential ingredient for the development of functional foods and nutraceuticals.

AB  - Schizophrenia (SZ) is a mental disorder that typically emerges in late adolescence or early adulthood. It reduces the life expectancy of patients by 15 years. Abnormal behavior, perception of emotions, social relationships, and reality perception are among its most significant symptoms. Past studies have revealed that SZ affects the temporal and anterior lobes of hippocampus regions of the brain. Also, increased volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and decreased volume of white and gray matter can be observed due to this disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the popular neuroimaging technique used to explore structural/functional brain abnormalities in SZ disorder, owing to its high spatial resolution. Various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been employed with advanced image/signal processing methods to accurately diagnose SZ. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of studies conducted on the automated diagnosis of SZ using MRI modalities. First, an AI-based computer aided-diagnosis system (CADS) for SZ diagnosis and its relevant sections are presented. Then, this section introduces the most important conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques in the diagnosis of diagnosing SZ. A comprehensive comparison is also made between ML and DL studies in the discussion section. In the following, the most important challenges in diagnosing SZ are addressed. Future works in diagnosing SZ using AI techniques and MRI modalities are recommended in another section. Results, conclusion, and research findings are also presented at the end.

AB  - We introduce dynamic predictive coding, a hierarchical model of spatiotemporal prediction and sequence learning in the neocortex. The model assumes that higher cortical levels modulate the temporal dynamics of lower levels, correcting their predictions of dynamics using prediction errors. As a result, lower levels form representations that encode sequences at shorter timescales (e.g., a single step) while higher levels form representations that encode sequences at longer timescales (e.g., an entire sequence). We tested this model using a two-level neural network, where the top-down modulation creates low-dimensional combinations of a set of learned temporal dynamics to explain input sequences. When trained on natural videos, the lower-level model neurons developed space-time receptive fields similar to those of simple cells in the primary visual cortex while the higher-level responses spanned longer timescales, mimicking temporal response hierarchies in the cortex. Additionally, the network's hierarchical sequence representation exhibited both predictive and postdictive effects resembling those observed in visual motion processing in humans (e.g., in the flash-lag illusion). When coupled with an associative memory emulating the role of the hippocampus, the model allowed episodic memories to be stored and retrieved, supporting cue-triggered recall of an input sequence similar to activity recall in the visual cortex. When extended to three hierarchical levels, the model learned progressively more abstract temporal representations along the hierarchy. Taken together, our results suggest that cortical processing and learning of sequences can be interpreted as dynamic predictive coding based on a hierarchical spatiotemporal generative model of the visual world.
   The brain is adept at predicting stimuli and events at multiple timescales. How do the neuronal networks in the brain achieve this remarkable capability? We propose that the neocortex employs dynamic predictive coding to learn hierarchical spatiotemporal representations. Using computer simulations, we show that when exposed to natural videos, a hierarchical neural network that minimizes prediction errors develops stable and longer timescale responses at the higher level; lower-level neurons learn space-time receptive fields similar to the receptive fields of primary visual cortical cells. The same network also exhibits several effects in visual motion processing and supports cue-triggered activity recall. Our results provide a new framework for understanding the genesis of temporal response hierarchies and activity recall in the neocortex.

AB  - Introduction: Cannabis sativa L. (CSL) extract has pain-relieving potential due to its cannabinoid content, so the effects of two CSL extracts on alleviating neuropathic pain were investigated in vivo. Methods and groups: Male Wistar rats (n = 130) were divided into groups and received vincristine (0.1 mg/kg) and gabapentin (60 mg/kg) to induce and relieve neuropathic pain or CSL extracts (D and B). The mRNA and protein expression of the cannabinoid receptors type 1 and 2 (CB1R, CB2R) were evaluated in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and lymphocytes. Behavioural tests (Tail-Flick and von Frey) were performed on all animals. Results: VK-induced neuropathic pain was accompanied by decreased CB1R protein level and CB2R mRNA expression in the cortex. Gabapentin relieved pain and increased CB1R protein levels in the hippocampus compared to the vincristine group. Hippocampus CB1R protein expression increased with the administration of extract D (10 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg) and extract B (7.5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg) compared to VK group. In the cerebral cortex CSL decreased CB1R protein expression (10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg of extract B) and mRNA level (5 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/kg of extract B; 20 mg/kg of extract D) compared to the VK-group.CB2R protein expression increased in the hippocampus after treatment with extract B (7.5 mg/kg) compared to the VK-group. In the cerebral cortex extract B (10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg) increased CB2R protein expression compared to VK-group. Conclusion: Alterations in cannabinoid receptor expression do not fully account for the observed behavioural changes in rats. Therefore, additional signalling pathways may contribute to the initiation and transmission of neuropathic pain. The Cannabis extracts tested demonstrated antinociceptive effects comparable to gabapentin, highlighting the antinociceptive properties of Cannabis extracts for human use.

AB  - Invasive neural electrodes prepared from materials with a miniaturized geometrical size could improve the longevity of implants by reducing the chronic inflammatory response. Graphene-based microfibers with tunable porous structures have a large electrochemical surface area (ESA)/geometrical surface area (GSA) ratio that has been reported to possess low impedance and high charge injection capacity (CIC), yet control of the porous structure remains to be fully investigated. In this study, we introduce wet-spun graphene-based electrodes with pores tuned by sucrose concentrations in the coagulation bath. The electrochemical properties of thermally reduced rGO were optimized by adjusting the ratio of rGO to sucrose, resulting in significantly lower impedance, higher CIC, and higher charge storage capacity (CSC) in comparison to platinum microwires. Tensile and insertion tests confirmed that optimized electrodes had sufficient strength to ensure a 100% insertion success rate with a low angle shift, thus allowing precise implantation without the need for additional mechanical enhancement. Acute in vivo recordings from the auditory cortex found low impedance benefits from the recorded amplitude of spikes, leading to an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Ex vivo recordings from hippocampal brain slices demonstrate that it is possible to record and stimulate with graphene-based electrodes with good fidelity compared with conventional electrodes.

AB  - Environmental enrichment devices (EEDs) have been proven to promote positive wellbeing in zoos and aquariums, and support animals' reintroduction success; however, their use in rehabilitation centers is still limited. This pilot study investigated the safety and efficacy of three EEDs, Artificial Kelp, Horse KONG((TM)) and Wubba Kong((TM)), and their ability to decrease and/or eliminate undesired stereotypic behaviors or looking at staff/staff areas in seven wild California sea lions (CSLs) and eight northern elephant seals (NESs) undergoing rehabilitation in Southern California. Observers conducted instantaneous sampling once a minute during a 30-min baseline, followed by a 30-min EED implementation on one focal animal at a time. The data were analyzed with generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). All three EEDs were found to be durable and safe throughout the study. Our results show a significant reduction in stereotypical behaviors compared to no EED treatments in CSLs, with the most significant effect being with the Horse KONG((TM)). The Wubba KONG (TM) and Artificial Kelp provisions also reduced the undesired behavior in both species of being focused on human caretakers. Individual preferences for specific EEDs were found within species and between species, with the NESs using EEDs more than the CSLs. This study highlights the beneficial aspect of EEDs for pinnipeds in rehabilitation centers for improving their quality of life.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated ROS generation are predominant contributors of neuronal death that is responsible for the diabetes-related cognitive impairments. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that long noncoding RNA-MEG3 can serve as an important regulator in the pathogenesis of diabetes. However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be further clarified. Here, it was observed that MEG3 was significantly down-regulated in STZ (streptozotocin)-induced diabetic rats. MEG3 overexpression noticeably improved diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunctions, accompanied by the abatement of Rac1 activation and ROS production, as well as the inhibition of mitochondria-associated apoptosis. Furthermore, either MEG3 overexpression or Rac1 inhibition promoted FUNDC1 dephosphorylation and suppressed oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation. Similarly, in vitro studies confirmed that hyperglycemia also down-regulated MEG3 expression in PC12 cells. MEG3 reintroduction protected PC12 cells against hyperglycemia-triggered neurotoxicity by improving mitochondrial fitness and repressing mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, these neuroprotective effects of MEG3 relied on FUNDC1-related mitophagy, since silencing of FUNDC1 abolished these beneficial outcomes. Additionally, MEG3 rescued HG-induced neurotoxicity was involved in inhibiting Rac1 expression via interaction with Rac1 3'UTR. Conversely, knockdown of MEG3 showed opposite effects. NSC23766, a specific inhibitor of Rac1, fully abolished harmful effects of MEG3 depletion. Consistently, knockdown of Rac1 potentiated FUNDC1-associated mitophagy. Meanwhile, colocalization of Rac1 and FUNDC1 was found in mitochondria under hyperglycemia, which was interrupted by MEG3 overexpression. Furthermore, silencing of Rac1 promoted PGAM5 expression, and FUNDC1 strongly interacted with LC3 in Rac1-deleted cells. Altogether, our findings suggested that the Rac1/ROS axis may be a downstream signaling pathway for MEG3-induced neuroprotection, which was involved in FUNDC1-associated mitophagy.

AB  - Introduction: Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessively inherited lysosomal storage disease that results from loss-of-function mutations in the HEXA gene coding beta-hexosaminidase A. HEXA gene deficiency affects the central nervous system owing to GM2 ganglioside accumulation in lysosomes resulting in progressive neurodegeneration in patients. We recently generated a novel mice model with a combined deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase A and neuraminidase 3 (Hexa-/-Neu3-/-) that mimics both the neuropathological and clinical abnormalities of early-onset Tay-Sachs disease. Here, we aimed to explore the secondary accumulation of lipids in the brain of Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice.Materials and Methods: In the cortex and hippocampus of five-month-old WT, Hexa-/-, Neu3-/-, and Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice, lipid levels belonging to glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, and sterol lipids were evaluated using a shotgun lipidomics approach. The levels of myelin were also assessed by luxol fast blue staining and immunohistochemistry using antibodies against myelin basic protein. We further examined glycoconjugate and cholesterol levels by periodic acid-Schiff and filipin staining, respectively. Toluidine blue staining was also performed to display axonal degeneration.Results: Among glycerophospholipids, we demonstrated elevated levels of phosphatidylcholine-ether and lysophosphatidylcholine while decreased levels of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine in both cortex and hippocampus of Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice. In the glycerolipid class, we showed an alleviated level of sphingomyelin in both cortex and hippocampus, but the higher levels of diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol were detected in only the hippocampus of Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice. The lower level of sterol was also detected in the cortex of Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice but not in the hippocampus.Histochemical studies showed a decrease in the myelin level and axonal degeneration indicating neuronal pathology in the brain of Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice. Although glycoconjugate accumulation was evident both in the cortex and hippocampus, we did not detect any changes in the level of cholesterol.Conclusion: Our results indicate that alterations in lipid metabolism and neuropathology, such as demyelination and axonal degeneration, might be related to the dysfunctionality of lipid-related cellular pathways like autophagy. Understanding of brain-specific lipid alterations contributes to evaluating the effectiveness of treatments in Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice in future studies.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, but no drugs can cure this disease. Chalcones possess good antioxidant activity, anti-neuroinflammatory activity, neuroprotective effects, inhibitory effects on A beta aggregation, and A beta disaggregation ability. Therefore, chalcones are ideal lead compounds, and the discovery of novel anti-AD agent-based chalcones is necessary. Methods: Hydroxy groups and aryl benzyl ether groups were introduced into chalcone scaffolds to obtain a series of 2-hydroxyl-4-benzyloxy chalcone derivatives. These derivatives were further synthesized, biologically evaluated, and docked. Results: Most target derivatives exhibited good anti-AD activities. In particular, compound 11d had excellent inhibitory effects on self-induced A beta(1-42) aggregation (90.8% inhibition rate at 25 mu M) and Cu2+ induced A beta(1-42) aggregation (93.4% inhibition rate at 25 mu M). In addition, it also exhibited good A beta(1-42) fibril disaggregation ability (64.7% at 25 mu M), significant antioxidative activity (ORAC = 2.03 Trolox equivalent), moderate MAO-B inhibition (IC50 = 4.81 mu M), selective metal chelation, appropriate BBB permeation, and dramatic anti-neuroinflammatory ability. In addition, compound 11d relieved AD symptoms and protected hippocampal neurons in vivo. Conclusion: Compound 11d is a promising multifunctional anti-A beta agent.

AB  - Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) is a metabolic enzyme that converts 1,3-diphosphoglycerate to 3phosphoglycerate. In the current study, we synthesized a PEP-1-PGK1 fusion protein that can cross the bloodbrain barrier and cell membrane, and the effects of PEP-1-PGK1 against oxidative stress were investigated HT22 cells and ischemic gerbil brain. The PEP-1-PGK1 protein and its control protein (Con-PGK1) were treated and permeability was evaluated HT22 cells. The PEP-1-PGK1 was introduced into HT22 cells depending on its concentration and incubation time and was gradually degraded over 36 h after treatment. PEP-1-PGK1, but not Con-PGK1, significantly ameliorated H2O2-induced cell damage and reactive oxygen species formation in HT22 cells. Additionally, PEP-1-PGK1, but not Con-PGK1, mitigated ischemia-induced hyperlocomotion 1 d after ischemia and 4 d after ischemia of neuronic cell death. PEP-1-PGK1 treatment significantly alleviated the raised lactate and succinate dehydrogenase activities in the early (15 min to 6 h) and late (4 and 7 d) stages of ischemia, respectively. In addition, PEP-1-PGK1 treatment ameliorated the decrease in ATP and pH levels in the late stage (2-7 d) of ischemia. Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) levels accelerated the ischemiainduced increase in the hippocampus 1 d after ischemia after PEP-1-PGK1 treatment. Neuroprotective and ameliorative effects were prominent at a low concentration (0.1 mg/kg), but not at a high concentration (1 mg/kg), of PEP-1-PGK1. Collectively, low concentrations of PEP-1-PGK1 prevented neuronal stress by increasing energy production.

AB  - The adapter protein SH2B1 is recruited to neurotrophin receptors, including TrkB (also known as NTRK2), the receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Herein, we demonstrate that the four alternatively spliced isoforms of SH2B1 (SH2B1 alpha-SH2B1 delta) are important determinants of neuronal architecture and neurotrophin-induced gene expression. Primary hippocampal neurons from Sh2b1(-/-) [knockout (KO)] mice exhibit decreased neurite complexity and length, and BDNF-induced expression of the synapse-related immediate early genes Egr1 and Arc. Reintroduction of each SH2B1 isoform into KO neurons increases neurite complexity; the brain-specific delta isoform also increases total neurite length. Human obesity-associated variants, when expressed in SH2B1 delta, alter neurite complexity, suggesting that a decrease or increase in neurite branching may have deleterious effects that contribute to the severe childhood obesity and neurobehavioral abnormalities associated with these variants. Surprisingly, in contrast to SH2B1 alpha, SH2B1 beta and SH2B1 gamma, which localize primarily in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, SH2B1 delta resides primarily in nucleoli. Some SH2B1 delta is also present in the plasma membrane and nucleus. Nucleolar localization, driven by two highly basic regions unique to SH2B1 delta, is required for SH2B1 delta to maximally increase neurite complexity and BDNF-induced expression of Egr1, Arc and FosL1.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by complex interactions between genetic risk factors and structural brain changes. Traditional diagnostic approaches that rely on single-modality data, such as imaging or genomics alone, often fall short in both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. To address these limitations, AlzCLIP, a novel contrastive learning framework that integrates single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles and MRI-derived imaging features into a unified embedding space is introduced. This joint representation captures disease-relevant interactions between genetic variation and brain structure, enabling both accurate diagnosis and mechanistic insight into AD. AlzCLIP is trained and evaluated on two large-scale cohorts, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the UK Biobank (UKB), and demonstrated robust diagnostic performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by up to 19%. More importantly, the model yields interpretable outputs through feature importance and interaction analyses, identifying key contributors to AD risk, including rs1135173, rs7575209, and rs66763080, as well as structural markers such as hippocampal volume and precuneus surface area. Notably, AlzCLIP uncovered genotype-specific effects on imaging phenotypes. Specifically, rs11077054 is associated with increased white matter hyperintensity burden and amygdala atrophy, suggesting a potential link between this variant and AD-related structural brain changes. Together, the results highlight AlzCLIP's potential to enhance AD risk prediction and provide biologically grounded insights by integrating multi-modal genomic and imaging data.

AB  - The microtubule-associated protein tau plays a central role in tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The exact molecular mechanisms underlying tau toxicity are unclear, but aging is irrefutably the biggest risk factor. This raises the question of how cellular senescence affects the function of tau as a microtubule regulator. Here we report that the proportion of tau that is proteolytically cleaved at the caspase-3 site (TauC3) doubles in the hippocampus of senescent mice. TauC3 is also elevated in AD patients. Through quantitative live-cell imaging, we show that TauC3 has a drastically reduced dynamics of its microtubule interaction. Single-molecule tracking of tau confirmed that TauC3 has a longer residence time on axonal microtubules. The reduced dynamics of the TauC3-microtubule interaction correlated with a decreased transport of mitochondria, a reduced processivity of APP-vesicle transport and an induction of region-specific dendritic atrophy in CA1 neurons of the hippocampus. The microtubule-targeting drug Epothilone D normalized the interaction of TauC3 with microtubules and modulated the transport of APP-vesicles dependent on the presence of overexpressed human tau. The results indicate a novel toxic gain of function, in which a post-translational modification of tau changes the dynamics of the tau-microtubule interaction and thus leads to axonal transport defects and neuronal degeneration. The data also introduce microtubule-targeting drugs as pharmacological modifiers of the tau-microtubule interaction with the potential to restore the physiological interaction of pathologically altered tau with microtubules.

AB  - Introduction: The complement response activates upon reperfusion in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and contributes to excessive neuroinflammation and worse outcomes. C5a is a powerful anaphylatoxin central to each of the complement pathways, and its engagement with C5aR1 is directly tied to brain injury and neuronal death. Reasoning C5aR1 antagonism can decrease excessive neuroinflammation and thereby improve neurological and functional outcomes, we tested this hypothesis in a rat model of HIE with PMX205, a small molecule that inhibits C5a-C5aR1 interaction. Methods: Term-equivalent pups (P10-12) were subjected to mild-moderate HIE by Vannucci's method and treated with PMX205. We compared motor and cognitive outcomes with two behavioral tests each (food handling and accelerod; novel object recognition [NOR] and open field) to improve the accuracy of our conclusions. Results: Improvements were observed in fine motor function, balance, and exploratory behaviors, but little to no improvement in recognition memory and gross motor function. Lesion area and histological assessments showed robust cortical neuroprotection from treatment but persistent injury to the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Better structural and functional outcomes were seen within 1 day of treatment, suggesting C5aR1 antagonism beyond the latent injury phase may impair recovery. In a dose-response experiment, cerebral area loss from injury was improved only in female rats, suggesting underlying sexual dimorphisms in the complement response. Conclusion: These results demonstrate proof-of-concept for targeting C5aR1 signaling in neonatal HIE with PMX205 and underscore the role of sex in hypoxic-ischemic injury.
   In this study, we tested a new treatment for a disease in babies called hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). HIE is caused by restricted oxygen and blood flow around the time of birth, and most damage is caused when blood flow is restored. One reason for this is excess inflammation, which happens because a large amount of specific proteins and chemicals are released. Some inflammation is protective, but excessive inflammation injures healthy tissue, and in HIE this contributes to lifelong physical and mental disabilities, even death. The only treatment for HIE is cooling therapy, but even with this treatment many infants still do not survive or live with permanent disability. We mimicked the disease in rats and then gave them a drug that prevents excess inflammation by binding and disabling specific proteins. We measured improvement by comparing physical and mental abilities and brain damage in the treated rats to untreated and normal rats. Overall, the drug improved many but not all skills and parts of the brain harmed by the disease. More testing needs to be done to determine the optimal dose and if there is additional benefit when the drug is combined with cooling therapy. In closing, our results show this treatment warrants further development and could help infants grow up with less hardship and lead better, healthier lives.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) implicates neuronal loss, plaque and neurofibrillary tangle formation, and disturbed neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis, which leads to severe dementia, memory loss, as well as thinking and behavioral perturbations that could ultimately lead to death. Calcium dysregulation and low acetylcholine levels are two main mechanisms implicated in Alzheimer's disease progression. Simultaneous inhibition of calcium oscillations (store overload-induced Ca2+ release [SOICR]) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by a single molecule may bring a new breath of hope for AD treatment. Here, we described some dantrolene derivatives as dual inhibitors of the ryanodine receptor and AChE. Two series of acylhydrazone/sulfonylhydrazone derivatives with aromatic group were designed and synthesized. In this study, the target compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit SOICR and AChE in vitro, using dantrolene and donepezil as positive controls. Compound 22a exhibited excellent and balanced inhibitory potency against SOICR (inhibition (%) = 90.1, IC50 = 0.162 mu M) and AChE (inhibition (%) = 93.5, IC50 = 0.372 mu M). Docking simulations showed that several preferred compounds could bind to the active sites of both the proteins, further validating the rationality of the design strategy. Potential therapeutic effects in AD were evaluated using the Barnes maze and Morris water maze tests, which demonstrated that compound 22a significantly improved memory and cognitive behavior in AD model mice. Moreover, it was also found that compound 22a could enhance synaptic strength by measuring hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in brain slices. These results suggested that the introduction of a sulfonyl-hydrazone scaffold and aromatic substitution to dantrolene derivatives provided a useful template for the development of potential chemical entities against AD.

AB  - Traditional monoclonal antibodies such as Trastuzumab encounter limitations when treating Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, particularly in cases that develop resistance. This study introduces plant-derived anti-HER2 variable fragments of camelid heavy chain domain (VHH) fragment crystallizable region (Fc) KEDL(K) antibody as a potent alternative for overcoming these limitations. A variety of biophysical techniques, in vitro assays, and in vivo experiments uncover the antibody's nanoscale binding dynamics with transmembrane HER2 on living cells. Single-molecule force spectroscopy reveals the rapid formation of two robust bonds, exhibiting approximately 50 pN force resistance and bond lifetimes in the second range. The antibody demonstrates a specific affinity for HER2-positive breast cancer cells, including those that are Trastuzumab-resistant. Moreover, in immune-deficient mice, the plant-derived anti-HER2 VHH-FcK antibody exhibits superior antitumor activity, especially against tumors that are resistant to Trastuzumab. These findings underscore the plant-derived antibody's potential as an impactful immunotherapeutic strategy for treating Trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer.

AB  - Introduction Acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2), one of the enzymes that catalyze the conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA, has been proved to be an oncogene in various cancers. However, the function of ACSS2 is still largely a black box in melanoma.Methods The ACSS2 expression was detected in melanoma cells and melanocytes at both protein and mRNA levels. Cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion were investigated after ACSS2 knockdown. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology was employed to identify differentially expressed genes caused by ACSS2 knockdown, which were then verified by immunoblotting analysis. Animal experiments were further performed to investigate the influence of ACSS2 on tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.Results Firstly, we found that ACSS2 was upregulated in most melanoma cell lines compared with melanocytes. In addition, ACSS2 knockdown dramatically suppressed melanoma cell migration and invasion, whereas promoted cell apoptosis in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Furthermore, tumor growth and metastasis were dramatically suppressed by ACSS2 knockdown in vivo. RNA-Seq suggested that the Hippo pathway was activated by ACSS2 knockdown, which was forwardly confirmed by Western blotting and rescue experiments. Taken together, we demonstrated that ACSS2 enables melanoma cell survival and tumor metastasis via the regulation of the Hippo pathway.Discussion In summary, this study demonstrated that ACSS2 may promote the growth and metastasis of melanoma by negatively regulating the Hippo pathway. Targeting ACSS2 may be a promising target for melanoma treatment.

AB  - Genome replication of positive strand RNA viruses requires the production of a complementary negative strand RNA that serves as a template for synthesis of more positive strand progeny. Structural RNA elements are important for genome replication, but while they are readily observed in the positive strand, evidence of their existence in the negative strand is more limited. We hypothesized that this was due to viruses differing in their capacity to allow this latter RNA to adopt structural folds. To investigate this, ribozymes were introduced into the negative strand of different viral constructs; the expectation being that if RNA folding occurred, negative strand cleavage and suppression of replication would be seen. Indeed, this was what happened with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and feline calicivirus (FCV) constructs. However, little or no impact was observed for chikungunya virus (CHIKV), human rhinovirus (HRV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) constructs. Reduced cleavage in the negative strand proved to be due to duplex formation with the positive strand. Interestingly, ribozyme-containing RNAs also remained intact when produced in vitro by the HCV polymerase, again due to duplex formation. Overall, our results show that there are important differences in the conformational constraints imposed on the folding of the negative strand between different positive strand RNA viruses.

AB  - Human agriculture has always raced against insect adaptation, requiring updated pest control methods and knowledge of evolutionary processes. Excessive exposure to blue light (BL) kills a wide range of insect species and has attracted attention as an alternative to chemical pesticides. Here, to understand how insects adapt to BL toxicity, we investigated evolutionary responses to BL toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster over 70 generations using laboratory selection experiments. The selected line exhibited an obese phenotype accompanied by midgut elongation, with BL tolerance dependent on gut microbiota-mediated lipid accumulation. Whole-genome and transcriptome analyses consistently highlighted interactions between the microbiota and host lipid metabolism-related genes. Remarkably, manipulating genes associated with lipid accumulation conferred BL tolerance even in the absence of selection. We suggest that the acquisition of BL tolerance occurs through 'adaptive obesity'. Our study introduces a mechanism of evolutionary adaptation of insects against BL-based selective pressure by maximising the benefits from the gut microbiota via midgut elongation.

AB  - Photoactive organic semiconductors, such as bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) of donor-acceptor pairs, are promising for building flexible devices for nongenetic and precise optical neuromodulation. However, the full potential of the diverse compositions and functionalities of BHJs has yet to be explored for neuromodulation due to their unsatisfactory interfaces with soft biotissues, which hinder signal transduction, tissue adhesion, and biocompatibility. Here, we address these challenges by introducing an interfacial layer composed of conductive and porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The MOFs layer enhances charge injection capacity at the interface by >400 times and ensures tight and biocompatible junction between BHJs and biological materials. These improvements enable efficient electrical-to-ionic signal transduction for various BHJs, supporting reliable nongenetic modulation of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons under deep-red and near-infrared light. Moreover, flexible devices made from MOFs-modified BHJs allow for the in vivo stimulation of rat sciatic nerves at an ultralow light intensity threshold (0.01 mW mm(-2)), 700 times lower than that required for unmodified devices. This interfacial engineering with porous MOFs can expand the material toolbox of BHJs-based photocapacitors and unlock more functionalities for neuromodulation and prosthetic biointerfaces.

AB  - Introduction Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are the most studied anti-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 family proteins. We previously characterized both of them, not only for their role in regulating apoptosis and resistance to therapy in cancer cells, but also for their non-canonical functions, mainly including promotion of cancer progression, metastatization, angiogenesis, and involvement in the crosstalk among cancer cells and components of the tumor microenvironment. Our goal was to identify transcriptional signature and novel cellular pathways specifically modulated by Bcl-2.Methods We performed RNAseq analysis of siRNA-mediated transient knockdown of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL in human melanoma cells and gene ontology analysis to identify a specific Bcl-2 transcriptional signature. Expression of genes modulated by Bcl-2 and associated to Hippo pathway were validated in human melanoma, breast adenocarcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines by qRT-PCR. Western blotting analysis were performed to analyse protein expression of upstream regulators of YAP and in relation to different level of Bcl-2 protein. The effects of YAP silencing in Bcl-2 overexpressing cancer cells were evaluated in migration and cell viability assays in relation to different stiffness conditions. In vitro wound healing assays and co-cultures were used to evaluate cancer-specific Bcl-2 ability to activate fibroblasts.Results We demonstrated the Bcl-2-dependent modulation of Hippo Pathway in cancer cell lines from different tumor types by acting on upstream YAP regulators. YAP inhibition abolished the ability of Bcl-2 to increase tumor cell migration and proliferation on high stiffness condition of culture, to stimulate in vitro fibroblasts migration and to induce fibroblasts activation.Conclusions We discovered that Bcl-2 regulates the Hippo pathway in different tumor types, promoting cell migration, adaptation to higher stiffness culture condition and fibroblast activation. Our data indicate that Bcl-2 inhibitors should be further investigated to counteract cancer-promoting mechanisms.

AB  - Introduction: The admission of the baby to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) can be a stressful predicament for parents. This study aims to evaluate parental stress levels and the factors impacting them. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the NICU of a tertiary care centre for 3 months. Data were collected using a questionnaire consisting of demographic characteristics of parents, neonates and Parental Stressor Scale: NICU (PSS: NICU) to measure parental stress. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and an independent t-test. Results: P & LE; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Most of the parents reported medium stress levels (3-3.9). The mean total parental stress score of parents was 3.31 (0.36). Amongst the PSS: NICU subscales, the NICU sight and sound caused maximum stress to the parents (mean = 3.35 [0.48]) followed by the relationship with the baby and parental role (mean = 3.34 [0.44]). Mothers felt more stressed as compared to fathers (mean = 3.60 [0.23] vs. 3.08 [0.28]; P < 0.05). Conclusion: Higher parental stress levels were seen in lower age group (18-25 years), less than high school education, unemployed and previous history of neonatal death, outborn deliveries, pre-term (gestational age <37 weeks), birth weight <1500 g, longer duration of respiratory support (>3 days), intubated with ventilatory support, not started on feeds and not given kangaroo mother care. Parents of NICU-admitted neonates are under significant stress, and there is a necessity to provide family-centred care.

AB  - Neuropsychiatric diseases, like depression, have a considerable and persistent impact on human health; however, little is known about their underlying pathogenesis. Social defeat is a model for stress-induced psychopathologies that could present with behaviors resembling those observed in humans with depression. However, previous animal models of social defeat mainly focus on adults. Here, we re-design the protocol of early-life stress-induced social defeat paradigm, which is based on a classic resident-intruder model. Briefly, each two-week-old experimental mouse of C57BL/6 strain is introduced into the home cage of an unfamiliar CD1 aggressor mouse for 30 min per day for 10 consecutive days. Later, all experimental mice are raised individually for another month. Finally, the mice are identified as defeated through social interaction and open field tests. This model has been shown to be etiological and predictive and provide high validity and could be a powerful tool to investigate the underlying pathogenesis of early onset depression.

AB  - Tobacco-etch-virus (TEV) protease is the workhorse of many laboratories in which protein expression is the linchpin of downstream experiments. TEV protease is remarkable in its sequence specificity as the cleavage sequence rarely appears in higher organisms and its ability to cleave fusion tag proteins from proteins of interest. Herein we report work done on large-scale production of TEV protease using different promotors, media, fusion tags, and expression platforms. During our work we detected post-translational modification (gluconoylation and phosphogluconoylation) of TEV protease and the subsequent effects this has on the purity of the protein. Subsequently we made our pgl plus bacteria that negates these modifications and their effects. We also introduce a GFP-based assay for measurement of activity and ultimately a new set of protocols for producing 400-500 mg/L TEV protease.

AB  - Introduction: Cognitive impairment is a vital complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The effect of irisin on CKD-induced cognitive impairment remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of Irisin in mitigating cognitive impairment and explore the underlying mechanisms in CKD.Methods: A CKD mice model was established by adenine. Cognitive function was assessed via the novel object recognition (NOR). Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while pyroptosis-related protein expression was analyzed using western blotting.Results: Our data showed an upregulation of cell pyroptosis in hippocampus tissues of CKD mice, accompanied by significant cognitive impairment. Pyroptosis and cognitive impairment was both improved by Irisin treatment in vivo. Additionally, irisin markedly downregulated pyroptosis levels through aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/NF-kappa B p65 signaling in HT-22 cells pretreated with indoxyl sulfate (IS). In vitro experiments further confirmed that pyroptosis was inhibited by AhR and NF-kappa B p65 inhibitors.Conclusions: We first demonstrated that irisin alleviated cognitive impairment by inhibiting AhR/NF-kappa B-NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis of hippocampal neurons in CKD. Overall, irisin may have the potential to serve as a critical antipyroptotic agent for improving CKD-induced cognitive impairment.

AB  - Stroke, the third leading cause of death worldwide, is a major cause of functional disability. Cerebral ischemia causes a rapid elevation of adenosine, the main neuromodulator in the brain. The inhibition of adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) has been introduced as a potential target in neurodegenerative disorders involving extracellular adenosine elevation. Istradefylline, a selective A2AR antagonist, has been approved for Parkinson's disease (PD) adjunctive therapy and showed neuroprotective effects in PD and Alzheimer's disease. However, the role of A2ARs in post-stroke neuronal damage and behavioral deficits remains unclear. We recently showed that A2AR antagonism prevented the adenosine-induced post-hypoxia synaptic potentiation of glutamatergic neurotransmission following the hypoxia/reperfusion of hippocampal slices. Here, we investigated the potential neuroprotective effects of istradefylline in male Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to pial vessel disruption (PVD) used to model a small-vessel stroke. Rats were treated with either a vehicle control or istradefylline (3 mg/kg i.p.) following PVD surgery for three days. Istradefylline administration prevented anxiety and depressive-like behaviors caused by PVD stroke. In addition, istradefylline significantly attenuated ischemia-induced cognitive impairment and motor deficits. Moreover, istradefylline markedly reduced hippocampal neurodegeneration, as well as GFAP/Iba-1, TNF-alpha, nNOS, and iNOS levels after PVD, but prevented the downregulation of anti-inflammatory markers TGF-beta 1 and IL-4. Together, these results suggest a molecular link between stroke and PD and that the anti-PD drug istradefylline displays translational potential for drug repurposing as a neuroprotective agent for cerebral ischemic damage.

AB  - Introduction: This study investigates the effects and mechanisms of Scutellaria baicalensis flavonoids (SSF) on passive avoidance learning and memory deficits induced by composite amyloid-beta proteins (A beta) via the MEK-ERK-CREB signaling pathway in rats based on network pharmacology and bioinformatics. Methods: Network pharmacology and bioinformatics identified target pathways. An Alzheimer's disease model was induced in male wistar rats using A beta(25-35), AlCl3, and RHTGF-beta(1)(referred to as compound A beta). Memory impairment was confirmed with the Morris water maze. Modeled rats were assigned to a control group and three SSF-treated groups for 33 days. Passive avoidance learning abilities were assessed with a step-down test, and p-crebser133 expression in the hippocampus was detected via immunohistochemistry. Real-time qPCR and western blotting measured mRNA and protein levels of c-Raf, MEKs, Rsk, and zif268 in the hippocampus and cortex. Results: Pathways such as the calcium signaling pathway, Apelin signaling pathway and cAMP signaling pathway were highlighted by KEGG analysis. The model had an 83.30% success rate. Model rats showed dry coats and unresponsiveness, while SSF treatment improved appearance and behavior. In passive avoidance tests, model rats made more errors and had shorter latencies (P < 0.01). They also showed decreased p-CREBSer133 and increased c-Raf, Rsk, and P-MEKs levels (P < 0.01), with reduced Zif268 (P < 0.01). SSF reversed these effects, enhancing p-CREBSer133 and Zif268 while regulating c-Raf, Rsk, and P-MEKs (P < 0.01). Conclusion: SSF ameliorates learning and memory impairments induced by composite A beta, acting through the MEK-ERK-CREB pathway in rats.

AB  - In recent years, extensive research has been done on the prediction, treatment, and recognition of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study of AD emerging and progression in the first years is valuable due to the nature of AD. Among scientific works, mathematical modeling of AD is an efficient way of studying the influence of various parameters on AD emerging. This paper proposes a novel model based on Cellular Automata (CA) for the study of AD's progress. In our model, the synapses of each neuron have been considered as square cells located around the central cell. The key parameter for AD progression in our model is amyloid-beta (A beta), which is calculated by differential rate equations of the Puri-Li model. Based on the proposed model in this article, we introduce a new definition of AD Rate for an M x L-neuron network, which can expand to the whole hippocampus space. To better illustrate the mechanism of this model, we simulate a 3 x 3 neuron network and discuss the obtained results. Our numerical results show that the variations of some parameters have a great effect on AD progress. For instance, it is obtained that AD Rate is sensitive to astroglia variations compared to microglia variations. The presented model can improve the scientist's insight into the prediction of AD, which will assist them in effectively considering the influence of various parameters on AD.

AB  - Introduction Recent work on bats flying over long distances has revealed that single hippocampal cells have multiple place fields of different sizes. At the network level, a multi-scale, multi-field place cell code outperforms classical single-scale, single-field place codes, yet the performance boundaries of such a code remain an open question. In particular, it is unknown how general multi-field codes compare to a highly regular grid code, in which cells form distinct modules with different scales.Methods In this work, we address the coding properties of theoretical spatial coding models with rigorous analyses of comprehensive simulations. Starting from a multi-scale, multi-field network, we performed evolutionary optimization. The resulting multi-field networks sometimes retained the multi-scale property at the single-cell level but most often converged to a single scale, with all place fields in a given cell having the same size. We compared the results against a single-scale single-field code and a one-dimensional grid code, focusing on two main characteristics: the performance of the code itself and the dynamics of the network generating it.Results Our simulation experiments revealed that, under normal conditions, a regular grid code outperforms all other codes with respect to decoding accuracy, achieving a given precision with fewer neurons and fields. In contrast, multi-field codes are more robust against noise and lesions, such as random drop-out of neurons, given that the significantly higher number of fields provides redundancy. Contrary to our expectations, the network dynamics of all models, from the original multi-scale models before optimization to the multi-field models that resulted from optimization, did not maintain activity bumps at their original locations when a position-specific external input was removed.Discussion Optimized multi-field codes appear to strike a compromise between a place code and a grid code that reflects a trade-off between accurate positional encoding and robustness. Surprisingly, the recurrent neural network models we implemented and optimized for either multi- or single-scale, multi-field codes did not intrinsically produce a persistent "memory" of attractor states. These models, therefore, were not continuous attractor networks.

AB  - Comparative research suggests that the hypothalamus is critical in switching between survival behaviors, yet it is unclear if this is the case in humans. Here, we investigate the role of the human hypothalamus in survival switching by introducing a paradigm where volunteers switch between hunting and escape in response to encounters with a virtual predator or prey. Given the small size and low tissue contrast of the hypothalamus, we used deep learning-based segmentation to identify the individual-specific hypothalamus and its subnuclei as well as an imaging sequence optimized for hypothalamic signal acquisition. Across 2 experiments, we employed computational models with identical structures to explain internal movement generation processes associated with hunting and escaping. Despite the shared structure, the models exhibited significantly different parameter values where escaping or hunting were accurately decodable just by computing the parameters of internal movement generation processes. In experiment 2, multi-voxel pattern analyses (MVPA) showed that the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and periaqueductal gray encode switching of survival behaviors while not encoding simple motor switching outside of the survival context. Furthermore, multi-voxel connectivity analyses revealed a network including the hypothalamus as encoding survival switching and how the hypothalamus is connected to other regions in this network. Finally, model-based fMRI analyses showed that a strong hypothalamic multi-voxel pattern of switching is predictive of optimal behavioral coordination after switching, especially when this signal was synchronized with the multi-voxel pattern of switching in the amygdala. Our study is the first to identify the role of the human hypothalamus in switching between survival behaviors and action organization after switching.
   Studies in animal models suggest that the hypothalamus is critical for modulating the switch between survival behaviors. In this study, neuroimaging combined with computational modeling shows that the hypothalamus also modulates switching between survival actions in humans.

AB  - Computational models of brain regions are crucial for understanding neuronal network dynamics and the emergence of cognitive functions. However, current supercomputing limitations hinder the implementation of large networks with millions of morphological and biophysical accurate neurons. Consequently, research has focused on simplified spiking neuron models, ranging from the computationally fast Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) linear models to more sophisticated non -linear implementations like Adaptive Exponential (AdEX) and Izhikevic models, through Generalized Leaky Integrate and Fire (GLIF) approaches. However, in almost all cases, these models are tuned (and can be validated) only under constant current injections and they may not, in general, also reproduce experimental findings under variable currents. This study introduces an Adaptive GLIF (A-GLIF) approach that addresses this limitation by incorporating a new set of update rules. The extended A-GLIF model successfully reproduces both constant and variable current inputs, and it was validated against the results obtained using a biophysical accurate model neuron. This enhancement provides researchers with a tool to optimize spiking neuron models using classic experimental traces under constant current injections, reliably predicting responses to synaptic inputs, which can be confidently used for large-scale network implementations.

AB  - Many biological systems are made to operate more quickly, efficiently, and with more power by storing elastic energy. This work introduces a straightforward bioinspired design for the quick manufacture of pre-stressed soft magnetic actuators. The actuator requires a lower magnetic field strength to be activated and can regain its original shape without the need for external stimuli. These characteristics are demonstrated in this work through the creation of actuators with round and helical shape structures inspired by the tendril plant and chameleon's tongue. Both the final form of the actuator and its actuation sequence may be programmed by controlling the direction and strength of the force utilised to pre-stress the elastomeric layer. Analytical models are presented to trace the actuators' energy storage, radius, and pitch. High-speed shape recovery after releasing the magnetic force and a strong grasping force are achieved due to the stored mechanical elastic energy. Experiments are conducted to analyse the shape changes, grasping action, and determine the actuation force. The manufacture of the grippers with zero-magnetic field strength holding capacities of up to 20 times their weight is made possible by the elastic energy that actuators store in their pre-stressed elastomeric layer. The outcomes of our research show that a unique magnetic field-controlled soft actuator can be created in different shapes and designs based on requirements.

AB  - IntroductionAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interactions and repetitive behaviors. This study examines the effects of fenofibrate on a propionic acid (PPA)-induced rat model of ASD, focusing on behavioral changes, inflammatory markers, and histological findings.Materials and MethodsThirty male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: a control group, a group receiving PPA and saline, and a group treated with PPA and fenofibrate for 15 days. Behavioral assessments, including the three-chamber sociability test, open-field test, and passive avoidance learning, were conducted. Biochemical analyses measured TNF-alpha, NGF, IL-17, IL-2, and galectin-3 levels in brain tissues. Histological evaluations focused on Purkinje neuron counts in the cerebellum and neuronal changes in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, along with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels.ResultsFenofibrate treatment significantly improved behavioral outcomes, reducing autism-like behaviors compared to the PPA/saline group. Biochemically, the PPA/saline group showed elevated levels of malondialdehyde, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-17, and galectin-3, which were reduced following fenofibrate treatment. Histologically, the PPA/saline group exhibited fewer, dysmorphic Purkinje neurons and increased glial activity in the CA1 region, both of which were ameliorated by fenofibrate treatment.ConclusionFenofibrate shows promise in mitigating autism-like behaviors in a rat model of ASD, likely due to its antioxidative and neuroprotective properties, which contribute to preserving neuronal integrity and reducing inflammation.

AB  - A major factor contributing to the etiology of depression is a neurochemical imbalance of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems, which is caused by persistently high levels of circulating stress hormones. Here, a computational model is proposed to investigate the interplay between dopaminergic and serotonergic-kynurenine metabolism under cortisolemia and its consequences for the onset of depression. The model was formulated as a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations represented with power-law functions. Parameter values were obtained from experimental data reported in the literature, biological databases, and other general information, and subsequently fine-tuned through optimization. Model simulations predict that changes in the kynurenine pathway, caused by elevated levels of cortisol, can increase the risk of neurotoxicity and lead to increased levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylaceltahyde (DOPAL) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde (5-HIAL). These aldehydes contribute to alpha-synuclein aggregation and may cause mitochondrial fragmentation. Further model analysis demonstrated that the inhibition of both serotonin transport and kynurenine-3-monooxygenase decreased the levels of DOPAL and 5-HIAL and the neurotoxic risk often associated with depression. The mathematical model was also able to predict a novel role of the dopamine and serotonin metabolites DOPAL and 5-HIAL in the ethiology of depression, which is facilitated through increased cortisol levels. Finally, the model analysis suggests treatment with a combination of inhibitors of serotonin transport and kynurenine-3-monooxygenase as a potentially effective pharmacological strategy to revert the slow-down in monoamine neurotransmission that is often triggered by inflammation.
   Author summary According to the World Health Organization, major depressive disorder (MDD) was in 2014 the fourth leading cause of disability in people between the ages of 15 and 44 years. MDD is responsible for about 1 million suicides per year and associated with a number of other medical conditions such as coronary disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. While MDD has been studied for a long time, molecular details of its pathophysiology are still scarce. Computational models offer a powerful opportunity to assist neuropsychiatric disorder research, as they permit the representation of large sets of physiological, cellular and biochemical phenomena through mathematical equations that can be simulated in a very efficient fashion and have the capacity to provide testable hypotheses. Here, we introduce a computational model of relevant biochemical pathways associated with high levels of circulating stress hormone, as they are observed in MDD. The model captures known observations well and demonstrates how increased levels of internally produced toxic agents, such as various kynurenines, DOPAL and 5-HIAL, can lead to dysregulation of key enzymes. These insights suggest new hypotheses for model-driven experiments, as well as novel potential targets for pharmacological intervention.

AB  - Puerarin 6''-O-acetate (P6''A), a puerarin derivative with a high stability and an improved permeability, exhibits a promising potential in drug development. The large-scale production of P6''A through green synthesis procedures has never been achieved owing to the low availability of acetyl-CoA. Herein, the enzymatic synthesis of P6''A in Escherichia coli cell factories overproducing acetyl-CoA has been achieved. Firstly, the effect of three acetyl-CoA-producing pathways on P6''A conversion in E.coli was compared comprehensively. The pathways containing acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) or the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex were thereby identified as favorable fluxes yielding more acetyl-CoA. Hence, cells co-expressing ACS and the PDH complex were selected as cell factories overproducing acetyl-CoA owing to the positive cooperativity of ACS and PDH. Subsequently, the maa gene encoding maltose acetyltransferase (MAT) was introduced into these acetyl-CoA-producing cell factories to form engineered strains Q1-Q14. After condition optimization, the engineered strain Q5 got a P6 '' A yield of 0.98 g L-1 in M9P-Glc medium supplemented with 2.5 mM puerarin and 1.5% glucose. To further improve P6 '' A production, the maa gene in Q5 was replaced by a mutant maaE125N gene to generate another engineered strain (Q15). Microbial production of P6''A in Q15 was achieved through the centrifuge tube culture, the shake-flask culture and the 6-L reactor culture and the highest P6'' A yield of up to 2.02 g L-1 was obtained in the reactor fermentation. Enzymatically synthesized P6''A displayed a high stability in human and mouse plasma, a dose-dependent cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells and an improved liposolubility. This research provides a feasible procedure for the green synthesis of puerarin monoesters and lays a foundation for druggability research on P6''A.

AB  - Human rhinovirus (RV) is one of the most frequent human pathogens. As causative agents of most common colds, RVs originate serious socioeconomic problems, and they are also associated to or exacerbate severe respiratory diseases. No anti-rhinoviral drugs or vaccines are available yet. In this study, amino acid residues that delimit a druggable pocket in the RV capsid were individually replaced by larger residues, which in most cases resulted in impaired virus infectivity. After serial infections of human host cells, the hampered mutant viruses invariably recovered full infectivity. Sequencing of the viral progeny revealed that, contrary to what has been observed when deleterious mutations were introduced in other virus capsid regions, those mutant RVs did not regain infectivity through the fixation of second-site mutations. Instead, infectivity was always recovered through reversion or pseudo-reversion events that replaced the deleterious bulky residue with a smaller residue, even though this strategy required, in some cases, the improbable fixation of two nucleotides in the corresponding codon. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations and determination of mechanical elasticity by atomic force microscopy revealed that the small-to-large, deleterious mutations reduced the capsid conformational flexibility; and the large-to-small, infectivity-restoring (pseudo)reversions led to recovery of the capsid flexibility. The stereochemistry of this druggable hydrophobic pocket in RV appears to be biologically constrained: The deleterious effect of reducing pocket volume and capsid flexibility is reverted during virus propagation only through same-site mutations that restore pocket volume and capsid flexibility. These constraints may help the further development of anti-RV drugs.<br /> (c) 2025 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a type of kidney cancer. It advances quickly and often metastasizes, making the prognosis for patients challenging. This study used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to study gene expression data of different stages of ccRCC obtained in the GEO database. The analysis identified three significant highly preserved gene modules across the datasets: GSE53757, GSE22541, GSE66272, and GSE73731. Functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis using DAVID revealed inflammatory pathways (e.g., NF-kB, Hippo, and HIF-1 pathways) that may drive ccRCC development and progression. The study also introduced the involvement of viral infections associated with the disease in the metabolic reprogramming of ccRCC. A drug repurposing analysis was also conducted to identify potential drug candidates for ccRCC using the upregulated and downregulated hub genes. The top candidates are ziprasidone (dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonist) and fentiazac (cyclooxygenase inhibitor). Other drug candidates were also obtained, such as phosphodiesterase/DNA methyltransferase/ATM kinase inhibitors, acetylcholine antagonists, and NAD precursors. Overall, the study's findings suggest that identifying several genes and signaling pathways related to ccRCC may uncover new targets, biomarkers, and even drugs that can be repurposed, which can help develop new and effective treatments for the disease.

AB  - Termites can cause severe economic damage in households, reservoirs, agriculture, and forests. Monitoring termite activity plays an important role in integrated termite management. A device for the automatic monitoring of termites with high accuracy and reliability is highly demanded. Here, we introduce Dekan electromagnetic induction with non-looping (DEMINL) method and a novel wireless system for the monitoring of termite activities. The system comprises of a termite bait station and a handheld reader. While the wood pieces in the bait station were consumed by termites, the device could generate alarm signals, which are sent to a signal reader (receiver) through radio frequency identification (RFID) and displayed on the handheld reader's screen. Field tests at three locations over a two-year period showed an accurate detection rate of 97.5-98.5%. The DEMINL-based device demonstrated high accuracy and durability in detecting termites, making it suitable for termite monitoring in households, crop fields, forests, and reservoirs.

AB  - Whole-brain network dynamics are yet to be fully understood, particularly in the context of auditory memory and predictive coding. BROAD-NESS (BROADband brain Network Estimation via Source Separation), a novel pipeline for extracting broadband whole-brain networks from source-reconstructed MEG data is introduced. During auditory sequence recognition, BROAD-NESS identified two orthogonal networks centered on auditory cortices. The first, also encompassing medial cingulate, is primarily involved in processing sounds and shows consistent but less marked differences between experimental conditions. The second, involving hippocampus, anterior cingulate, insula, and inferior temporal regions, exhibits strong condition-dependent dynamics, reflecting engagement in confirmed predictions and prediction errors. The networks differ in temporal dynamics, spatial gradients, and behavioral relevance. Phase space and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) reveal that more recurrent and stable dynamics are linked to higher accuracy and faster responses across sequence types. BROAD-NESS also enables direct PCA versus ICA comparison, showing PCA-based networks to be more robust and interpretable. Conceptually, this work reveals a dual-stream embedded organization of auditory memory networks that mirrors, yet functionally diverges from, visual pathways. Methodologically, it introduces BROAD-NESS, a powerful and interpretable pipeline for characterizing the spatiotemporal architecture of brain networks in neurophysiology.

AB  - Cancer vaccines offer a promising avenue in cancer immunotherapy by inducing systemic, tumor-specific immune responses. Tumor extracellular vesicles (TEVs) are nanoparticles naturally laden with tumor antigens, making them appealing for vaccine development. However, their inherent malignant properties from the original tumor cells limit their direct therapeutic use. This study introduces a novel approach to repurpose TEVs as potent personalized cancer vaccines. The study shows that inhibition of both YAP and autophagy not only diminishes the malignancy-associated traits of TEVs but also enhances their immunogenic attributes by enriching their load of tumor antigens and adjuvants. These revamped TEVs, termed attenuated yet immunogenically potentiated TEVs (AI-TEVs), showcase potential in inhibiting tumor growth, both as a preventive measure and a possible treatment for recurrent cancers. They prompt a tumor-specific and enduring immune memory. In addition, by showing that AI-TEVs can counteract cancer growth in a personalized vaccine approach, a potential strategy is presented for developing postoperative cancer immunotherapy that's enduring and tailored to individual patients.
   Simultaneously inhibiting the YAP protein and autophagy while inducing ICD on tumor cells leads to the production of attenuated yet immunogenically potentiated TEVs (AI-TEVs). AI-TEVs effectively activate tumor-specific immunity and can be used as a prophylactic and post-operative therapy to prevent cancer recurrence. They can also serve as the basis for personalized cancer vaccines by utilizing autologous tumor cells. image

AB  - Introduction. Transient global ischaemia in rodents causes selective loss of hippocampal CA1neurons, but the potential involvement of endocytic pathways has not been fully explored. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in early endosomes in the CA1 subfield after ischaemia and reperfusion. Material and methods. A four-vessel occlusion (4-VO) model was established in Wistar rats to induce 13 minutes of global cerebral ischaemia. Neuronal death was detected by Fluoro-Jade B (FJ-B) staining at various intervals after reperfusion, and intracellular membrane changes in ischaemic neurons were revealed using DiOC6(3), 6 (3), a lipophilic fluorescent probe. Ras-related protein Rab5 (Rab5) immunostaining was performed to detect changes in early endosomes in ischaemic neurons. Western blot analysis was used to confirm the morphological observations on Rab5 in the CA1 hippocampal subfield. Results. FJ-B staining confirmed progressive neuronal death in the CA1 subfield in ischaemic rats after reperfusion. DiOC6(3) 6 (3) staining revealed abnormally increased membranous components in ischaemic CA1 neurons. Specifically, early endosomes, as labelled by Rab5 immunostaining, significantly increased in number and size in CA1 neurons at 1.5 and 2 days post-reper fusion, followed by rupture at day 3 and a decrease in staining intensity at day 7 post-reper fusion. Western blot analysis confirmed a significant upregulation of Rab5 protein levels at day 2, which returned to near control levels by day 7. Conclusions. Our study revealed significant changes in the dynamics of early endosomes in CA1 neurons after ischaemia-reper fusion injury. The initial increase in the area fraction of early endosomes in CA1 neurons may reflect an upregulation of endocytic activity, whereas the fragmentation and reduction of early endosomes at the later stage may indicate a failure of adaptive mechanisms of ischaemic neurons against ischaemia-induced death. Understanding the temporal dynamics of early endosomes provides critical insights into the cellular mechanisms that govern fate of CA1 hippocampal neuronsl after ischaemia/reper fusion.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, complex disease with poorly understood pathogenesis. Disruption of glucose metabolism is implicated in the pathogenesis of depression. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been shown to regulate the activity of several kinases, including pAKT, p38MAPK, and mTOR, which are important signaling pathways in the treatment of depression. This study tested the hypothesis that rosiglitazone (RGZ) has an antidepressant impact on dexamethasone (DEXA)-induced depression by analyzing the function of the pAKT/p38MAPK/mTOR pathway and NGF through regulation of AMPK. MDD-like pathology was induced by subcutaneous administration of DEXA (20 mg/kg) for 21 days in all groups except in the normal control group, which received saline. To investigate the possible mechanism of RGZ, the protein expression of pAMPK, pAKT, p38MAPK, and 4EBP1 as well as the levels of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, and NGF were assessed in prefrontal cortex and hippocampal samples. The activities of pAMPK and NGF increased after treatment with RGZ. The administration of RGZ also decreased the activity of mTOR as well as downregulating the downstream signaling pathways pAKT, p38MAPK, and 4EBP1. Here, we show that RGZ exerts a potent inhibitory effect on the pAKT/p38MAPK/mTOR/4EBP1 pathway and causes activation of NGF in brain cells. This study has provided sufficient evidence of the potential for RGZ to ameliorate DEXA-induced depression. A new insight has been introduced into the critical role of NGF activation in brain cells in depression. These results suggest that RGZ is a promising antidepressant for the treatment of MDD.

AB  - As photoautotrophic organisms, plants produce an incredible spectrum of pigments, anti-herbivory compounds, structural materials and energic intermediates. These biosynthetic routes help plants grow, reproduce and mitigate stress. HEXOKINASE1 (HXK1), a metabolic enzyme and glucose sensor, catalyzes the phosphorylation of hexoses, a key introductory step for many of these pathways. However, previous studies have largely focused on the glucose sensing and signaling functions of HXK1, and the importance of the enzyme's catalytic function is only recently being connected to plant development. In this brief Spotlight, we describe the developmental significance of plant HXK1 and its role in plant metabolic pathways, specifically in glucose-6-phosphate production. Furthermore, we describe the emerging connections between metabolism and development and suggest that HXK1 signaling and catalytic activity regulate discrete areas of plant development.

AB  - Prokineticin 2 (PROK2) is a secreted bioactive peptide that regulates a variety of biological responses via two GPCRs, the prokineticin receptors (PROKRs). The aim of this study was to characterize a new alternatively spliced product of the prok2 gene consisting of four exons. The 40-amino acid peptide, designated PROK2C, is encoded by exon 1 and exon 4, and its expression was detected in the hippocampus and spinal cord of mice. PROK2C was expressed in a heterologous system, Pichia pastoris, and its binding specificity to the amino-terminal regions of PROKR1 and PROKR2 was investigated by GST pull-down experiments. In addition, the introduction of the unnatural amino acid p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine using amber codon suppression technology demonstrated the role of tryptophan at position 212 of PROKR2 for PROK2C binding by photoactivatable cross-linking. The functional significance of this new isoform was determined in vivo by nociceptive experiments, which showed that PROK2C elicits strong sensitization of peripheral nociceptors to painful stimuli. In order to analyze the induction of PROK2C signal transduction, STAT3 and ERK phosphorylation levels were determined in mammalian CHO cells expressing PROKR1 and PROKR2. Our data show by in vivo and in vitro experiments that PROK2C can bind and activate both prokineticin receptors.

AB  - Introduction: Total hip arthroplasty is a major orthopedic intervention, which is increasingly performed, and involves a variable duration of postoperative hospitalization. Estimating this duration is essential for optimizing resources and improving perioperative planning. Materials and Methods: The retrospective study included 85 patients admitted to an orthopedic clinic between 2020 and 2025, undergoing primary hip arthroplasty. Pre- and postoperative clinical, biological, and surgical data were collected. Based on these variables, the H.I.P.P.O. (Hip Intervention Patient Prognostic Outcome) score was developed, using a Random Forest algorithm to predict the length of stay (short, medium, long). Results: The model achieved an overall accuracy of 80%. The most important predictors were as follows: day of surgery, type of prosthesis, preoperative fibrinogen, INR, APTT, preoperative hemoglobin, age, and presence of liver cirrhosis. The H.I.P.P.O. score allowed efficient stratification of patients and showed a high capacity to identify cases at risk of prolonged hospitalization (F1 score = 0.857). Conclusions: The H.I.P.P.O. score is a practical, interpretable, and clinically applicable tool that integrates biological and organizational factors to predict the length of stay after hip arthroplasty. It can support surgical decision making and optimize perioperative management.

AB  - Immortalized cell lines with many advantages are widely used in various experimental contexts by many different labs. However, the absence of available cell lines poses difficulties for research in some species, such as camels. To establish an immortalized Bactrian camel fibroblast (iBCF) cell line and understand its biological characteristics, primary fibroblast cells from Bactrian camels were isolated and purified using enzymatic digestion in this study, and telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) vectors were introduced into primary BCF (pBCF) for continuous passage to 80 generations after screening with G418. The cell morphology of different generations was examined under a microscope. Cell cycle and viability were evaluated by flow cytometry and CCK-8 assay, respectively. Cellular genes expression was monitored by qPCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot, respectively. Chromosomes were determined by karyotyping. The results showed that like most other cells, both pBCF and iBCF were sensitive to nutrient concentrations and adapted to culture in the medium with 4.5 g/L glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) concentration. hTERT gene was introduced and stably expressed in iBCF cells, which promoted BCF cell immortalization. The fibroblast specific marker vimentin (VIM) is expressed in both pBCF and iBCF, but epithelial marker cytokeratin18 (CK18) expression is weak in BCF cells. Proliferation and viability detection showed that hTERT-induced iBCF exhibits faster growth rates and higher viability than pBCF. Karyotyping showed that iBCF maintained the same number and morphology of chromosomes as the pBCF. This study demonstrated that we have successfully constructed an immortalized Bactrian camel fibroblast cell line, which was named BCF23. The establishment of the BCF23 cell line provides a foundation for expanding camel-related research.

AB  - As a privileged scaffold, chromanone has been extensively introduced in the design of drug leads with diverse pharmacological features, particularly in the area of inflammatory diseases. Herein, the preparation of chromanone-based derivatives (4a-4i) was smoothly achieved, and their structures were characterized using H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, and ESI-HRMS spectroscopy techniques. Out of them, analogue 4e exhibited the most potent inhibitory capacity against the NO release and iNOS expression, without apparent cytotoxicity. Our observations showed that 4e could dramatically prevent the translocation of NF-kappa B from the cytoplasm to nucleus, and decrease the production of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta in LPS-induced BV-2 cells. Mechanistically, 4e significantly deactivated NF-kappa B by disturbing TLR4-mediated TAK1/NF-kappa B and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades. Consistent with the in vitro study, 4e could effectively mitigate the inflammation response of hippocampal tissue in LPS-induced mouse model by inhibiting microglial activation. Collectively, these results revealed 4e as a prospective neuroprotective candidate for the therapy of neuroinflammation-related disorders.

AB  - Introduction Ferroptosis, a type of iron-dependent regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a critical contributing factor to hippocampal neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dysregulated iron homeostasis exacerbates oxidative injury, impairing cognitive function. This study provides experimental evidence that thymoquinone (TQ) exerts neuroprotective effects in an AD-related ferroptosis model by modulating iron, lipid, and glutathione metabolism. Methods Thirty female C57BL/6 mice (8-10 weeks, 18-22 g) were randomly allocated into five groups: 1- Control, 2- artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; 20 ng/L), 3- RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3) (100 ng/10 mu L in aCSF), 4- RSL3 + TQ (50 mg/kg in 1.0% w/v acacia gum), and 5- TQ alone (50 mg/kg in 1.0% w/v acacia gum). A bilateral hole was drilled according to the Bregma coordinates (0.5 mm back, 1 mm left-right, 2,5 mm deep) and a 10 mu l Hamilton syringe was inserted perpendicularly from the skull to the brain. RSL3 (100 ng/10 mu l) was infused with 4 mu l (Intracerebral-IC). Cognitive and anxiety-like behaviors were assessed using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) and the Open Field Test (OFT). Hippocampal oxidative markers, total antioxidant status (TAS), and total oxidant status (TOS), were determined by spectrophotometric quantification. GPx4, XCT, and Fpn mRNA levels were measured by qRT-PCR. Protein expression and distribution were assessed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Iron accumulation was visualized using Perl's Prussian blue staining method. Results RSL3-induced ferroptosis impaired spatial learning and increased anxiety-like behavior, accompanied by elevated hippocampal iron accumulation, oxidative stress, and downregulation of GPx4, XCT, and Fpn. TQ treatment significantly restored TAS levels, reduced TOS, suppressed iron deposition, and reversed ferroptosis-associated molecular changes, upregulating GPx4 and Fpn while attenuating XCT downregulation (P < 0.05). Ferroptosis-induced behavioral deficits were significantly improved by TQ. Conclusion: These findings identify TQ as a potent modulator of ferroptosis, acting through coordinated regulation of iron export, lipid peroxidation, and glutathione-dependent antioxidant defenses. TQ targeting convergent ferroptosis pathways is a promising therapeutic candidate to alleviate hippocampal neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD.

AB  - Green nanocomposites combining cellulose nano fibrils (CNFs), cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), and lignin nano particles (LNPs) were designed and applied for the first time as ternary protective coatings on cellulosic materials, i.e., substrates mainly composed of cellulose. All the nanostructures were obtained from elephant grass biomass. CNFs and CNCs are less than 10 nm thick and present a filament-like morphology, while LNPs are spheres with an average diameter of less than 100 nm. The use of water-based nanoparticle dispersions is a facile and greener alternative to synthetic varnishes usually based on toxic organic solvents. Moreover, the coatings from renewable sources were chemically stable; showed high compatibility with wood, paper, and fabric; and preserved the roughness and surface morphology of the substrates after application. Moist-heat accelerated aging and UV-shielding assays revealed that the nanocellulose/nanolignin coatings were able to protect the coated cellulosic substrates against degradation. The wettability of nanocomposite-coated substrates could be tailored and reduced to produce hydrophobic surfaces by applying additional layers of water-based carnauba wax nanoparticles, which are also sustainable. Additionally, two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy mapping confirmed the reversibility of the coating application, as the nanocomposite layers could be easily removed from the cellulosic substrates by water-loaded cleaning hydrogels. Therefore, the functional protective coating introduced here represents an environmentally friendly and nontoxic approach for the conservation of cellulosic artifacts in general, including cultural heritage objects based on paper, wood, and fabric.

AB  - As additive manufacturing by fused filament fabrication has gained popularity, computational analysis has become fundamental in predicting the mechanical behavior of 3D models. This paper proposes the development of a method for the finite element (FE) simulation of 3D-printed parts, implementing model design reverse engineering using G-code to obtain their digital twins (DTs). Samples were printed under the ASTM D638 standard with different nozzle diameters and layer heights, which allowed them to be mechanically characterized by tensile tests. The tensile tests determined that the diameter of the nozzles used (between 0.2 mm and 1.0 mm) influences the material's tensile strength. The greater the diameter, the greater the stiffness, which translates into a change in the Young's modulus, as well as greater tensile strength and thus a reduction of the deformation, for which a value of 2.66 +/- 0.6% was obtained, i.e., the filament diameter did not influence this aspect. After carrying out the reverse engineering process of the samples to obtain DTs of the physical models, the printing G-code was used with the help of a Python script for their conversion to trajectories. These trajectories were introduced into Rhinoceros software with the Grasshopper add-on to obtain the reconstructed 3D models. The deposited filament profile used to reconstruct the DT was obtained by microscopy of the section of the physical samples. The predominant profile observed was that of a flattened oval. FE simulation was then carried out, obtaining a similarity of 90% between the simulated and mechanical tests, which validated the proposed method of predicting mechanical stresses in printed 3D elements.

AB  - Transcriptional enhanced associate domain (Tead)-mediated Hippo signaling pathway regulates diverse physiological processes; its dysfunction has been implicated in an increasing number of human gynecological cancers. The transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (Taz) binds to and then activates Tead through forming a three-helix bundle (THB) at their complex interface. The THB is defined by a double-helical hairpin from Tead and a single alpha-helix from Taz, serving as the key interaction hotspot between Tead and Taz. In the present study, the helical hairpin was derived from Tead protein to generate a hairpin segment, which is a 25-mer polypeptide consisting of a longer helical arm-1 and a shorter helical arm-2 as well as a flexible loop linker between them. Dynamics simulation and energetics characterization revealed that the hairpin peptide is intrinsically disordered when splitting from its protein context, thus incurring a large entropy penalty upon binding to Taz alpha-helix. A disulfide bridge was introduced across the two helical arms of hairpin peptide to obtain a strong binder termed TAZ-hTrap, which can maintain in a considerably structured, native-like conformation in unbound state, and the entropy penalty was minimized by disulfide stapling to effectively improve its affinity toward the alpha-helix. These computational findings can be further substantiated by circular dichroism and fluorescence polarization at molecular level, and viability assay also observed a potent cytotoxic effect on diverse human gynecological tumors at cellular level. In addition, we further demonstrated that the TAZ-hTrap has a good selectivity for its cognate Taz over other noncognate proteins that share a high conservation with the Taz alpha-helix.

AB  - Tideglusib is a non-competitive GSK-3 beta inhibitor which contain 1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione moiety, and now mainly used for progressive supranuclear palsy due to the lack of some primary cognitive endpoints and secondary endpoints in a phase IIb trail for Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, insufficient evidence exists to support that there are obvious covalent bonds between Tideglusib and GSK-3 beta. Targeted covalent inhibition strategy could improve the binding efficiency, selectivity and duration of kinase inhibitors. Based on the above premise, two series of targeted compounds with acryloyl warheads were designed and synthesized. The kinase inhibitory activity of the selected compound 10a with better neuroprotective effect improved 2.7 fold than that of Tideglusib. After the preliminary screening of GSK-3 beta inhibition and neuroprotective activity, the mechanism action of the selected compound 10a was investigated in vitro and in vivo. The results confirmed that 10a with excellent selectivity among the whole tested kinases could significantly reduce the expressions of APP and p-Tau via increasing the level of p-GSK-3 beta. The pharmacodynamic assay in vivo showed that 10a could markedly improve the learning and memory functions in AD mice induced by AlCl3 combined with D-galactose. At the same time, the damage of hippocampal neurons in AD mice was obviously reduced. Accordingly, the introduction of acryloyl warheads could increase the GSK-3 beta inhibitory activity of 1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione derivatives, and the selected compound 10a deserves further research as an effective GSK-3 beta inhibitor for the potential treatment of AD.

AB  - Plant-based meat analogs often exhibit poor elasticity, limited water-holding capacity, and lack a well-integrated fat-phase, which limits their applications in food industry. This study aimed to introduce camellia seed-derived oleosomes as templates for lipid droplets into textured soy protein-wheat gluten, followed by dual-crosslinking using transglutaminase (TG) and sodium alginate with varying Ca2+ concentrations. Results showed that oleosomes inclusion transformed the porous structures of textured proteins into droplet-embedded protein matrices, along with enhanced hardness, increased lightness, and reduced redness. TG induction promoted the epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)-lysine bonds between oleosomes and continuous-phase proteins, while sodium alginate, reinforced by Ca2+, created a robust network structure with smaller pore sizes and more interaction zones that tightly held the oleosomes. The addition of 10-20 mM CaCl2 significantly increased the immobilized water content, G ' values and promoted the transformation of beta-turns to beta-sheets. According to Lissajous-Bowditch analyses, oleosome-protein meat analog was identified as a soft gel, exhibiting erratic and abrupt changes at strain <= 10 %. In contrast, TG-treated analogs, particularly those with both TG and Ca2+, exhibited greater structural elasticity and resistance to large deformations (<= 500 %), due to double-network structures with enhanced mechanical strength and reversible deformation resistance. Additionally, double-crosslinked meat analogs significantly influenced the rate of lipid digestion.

AB  - Coating seeds with biocontrol agents represents an effective approach for managing soil-borne plant diseases. However, improving the viability of biocontrol microorganisms on the seed surface or in the rhizosphere remains a big challenge due to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this work, we developed a microbial seed coating strategy that uses sporopollenin exine capsules (SECs) as carriers for the encapsulation of the biofilm-like biocontrol bacteria. SECs was extracted from camellia bee pollen, and then characterized by Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), elemental analysis and thermal gravity analysis (TG). The Paenibacillus polymyxa ZF129, a biocontrol bacterium, was introduced into SECs using the vacuum-incubation method and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Notably, the ZF129 cell formed a biofilm-like structure inside the SECs, which enhanced their tolerance to acidic stress. As a proof of concept, we applied ZF129-loaded SECs to coat pak choi seeds using a straightforward plate-shaking technique. The coated seeds demonstrated a high control efficacy of up to 60.46 % against clubroot disease. Overall, this study sheds light on the application of SECs as promising carrier for the encapsulation of biofilm-like biocontrol bacteria, further augmenting the biocontrol functionality of microbial seed coating.

AB  - Biomechanical contributions of the extracellular matrix underpin cell growth and proliferation, differentiation, signal transduction, and other fate decisions. As such, biomaterials whose mechanics can be spatiotemporally altered- particularly in a reversible manner- are extremely valuable for studying these mechanobiological phenomena. Herein, a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogel model consisting of two interpenetrating step-growth networks is introduced that are independently formed via largely orthogonal bioorthogonal chemistries and sequentially degraded with distinct recombinant sortases, affording reversibly tunable stiffness ranges that span healthy and diseased soft tissues (e.g., 500 Pa-6 kPa) alongside terminal cell recovery for pooled and/or single-cell analysis in a near "biologically invisible" manner. Spatiotemporal control of gelation within the primary supporting network is achieved via mask-based and two-photon lithography; these stiffened patterned regions can be subsequently returned to the original soft state following sortase-based secondary network degradation. Using this approach, the effects of 4D-triggered network mechanical changes on human mesenchymal stem cell morphology and Hippo signaling, as well as Caco-2 colorectal cancer cell mechanomemory using transcriptomics and metabolic assays are investigated. This platform is expected to be of broad utility for studying and directing mechanobiological phenomena, patterned cell fate, and disease resolution in softer matrices.
   Biomaterials that can dynamically change stiffnesses are essential in further understanding the role of extracellular matrix mechanics. Using independently formulated and subsequently degradable interpenetrating hydrogel networks, the stiffening/softening of cell-laden matrices is reversibly and spatiotemporally triggered. Terminal cell recovery for pooled and/or single-cell analysis is permitted in a near "biologically invisible" manner. image

AB  - Introduction: During the last decade, there has been a significant rise in the use of therapeutic antibodies or passive immunotherapy for treating various conditions like inflammation and cancer. However, these proteins face challenges reaching the brain and often require specialized delivery methods such as single-domain antibodies (sdAbs). Traditional antibodies struggle to efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), hindering their effectiveness. Receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) offers a promising pathway for transporting large molecules essential for brain function and treatment across the BBB. Methods: SdAbs and peptide ligands with an affinity for RMT receptors are commonly employed to enhance the transport of biotherapeutics compounds across the BBB. This research used a sdAbs phage-displayed library from 13 camelus dromedarius samples to identify sdABs that specifically bind to and are internalized by human BBB endothelial cells (ECs) through in vivo panning. Results and discussion: One sdAb, defined as FB24, was isolated, sequenced, translated into an open reading frame (ORF), and subjected to three-dimensional (3D) modeling. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were carried out by the HADDOCK web server and GROMACS, respectively, to evaluate the interaction between FB24 and EC receptors in silico. The docking results revealed that FB24 exhibited binding activity against potential EC receptors with -1.7 to -2.7 ranged z score and maintained a stable structure. The docked complex of FB24-RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products, also known as advanced glycation end product receptor [AGER]) showed 18 hydrogen bonds and 213 non-bonded contacts. It was chosen for further analysis by molecular dynamics simulations by GROMACS. This complex showed a stable condition, and its root mean square deviation (RMSD) was 0.218 nm. The results suggest that FB24 could serve as a suitable carrier vector for transporting therapeutic and diagnostic agents across the BBB to the brain through a non-invasive route.

AB  - Introduction: The metabolic routes altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain are poorly understood. As the metabolic pathways are evolutionarily conserved, the metabolic profiles carried out in animal models of AD could be directly translated into human studies.Methods: We performed untargeted Nuclear Magnetic Resonance metabolomics in hippocampus of McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic (Tg) rats, a model of AD-like cerebral amyloidosis and the translational potential of these findings was assessed by targeted Gas Chromatography-Electron Impact-Mass Spectrometry in plasma of participants in the German longitudinal cohort AgeCoDe.Results: In rat hippocampus 26 metabolites were identified. Of these 26 metabolites, nine showed differences between rat genotypes that were nominally significant. Two of them presented partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) loadings with the larger absolute weights and the highest Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) scores and were specifically assigned to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide (Nam). NAD levels were significantly decreased in Tg rat brains as compared to controls. In agreement with these results, plasma of AD patients showed significantly reduced levels of Nam in respect to cognitively normal participants. In addition, high plasma levels of Nam showed a 27% risk reduction of progressing to AD dementia within the following 2.5 years, this hazard ratio is lost afterwards.Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that a decrease of Nam plasma levels is observed couple of years before conversion to AD, thereby suggesting its potential use as biomarker for AD progression.

AB  - <bold>Introduction: </bold>Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) expression and function is frequently altered in different cancers but scarcely explored in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This prompted us to investigate the clinical relevance of LOXL2 expression pattern in OSCC and also a possible crosstalk with Hippo/YAP1 pathway signaling. <bold>Methods: </bold>Immunohistochemical analysis of LOXL2 protein expression was performed in 158 OSCC patient samples, together with Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) activation status. Correlations with clinicopathological parameters and patient survival were assessed. <bold>Results: </bold>Tumor cell-intrinsic LOXL2 expression showed two distinct expression patterns: diffuse cytoplasmic staining (64.6%) and heterogeneous perinuclear staining (35.4%). Remarkably, perinuclear LOXL2 staining was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, advanced clinical stage and perineural invasion. Moreover, patients harboring tumors with perinuclear LOXL2 expression exhibited significantly poorer disease-specific survival (DSS) rates, and perinuclear LOXL2 positivity gradually increased in relation to YAP1 activation. Patients harboring tumors with concomitant perinuclear LOXL2 and fully active YAP1 exhibited the worst DSS. Multivariate Cox analysis further revealed combined perinuclear LOXL2 and fully active YAP1 as a significant independent predictor of poor DSS. <bold>Conclusion: </bold>Tumor-intrinsic perinuclear LOXL2 emerges as a clinically and biologically relevant feature associated with advanced disease, tumor aggressiveness, and poor prognosis in OSCC. Moreover, this study unprecedentedly uncovers a functional relationship between perinuclear LOXL2 and YAP1 activation with major prognostic implications. Notably, combined perinuclear LOXL2 and fully active YAP1 was revealed as independent predictor of poor prognosis. These findings encourage targeting oncogenic LOXL2 functions for personalized treatment regimens.

AB  - Introduction: This study aims to test the hypothesis that increased ketone body production resulting from a ketogenic diet (KD) will correlate with reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipid subspecies and improved clinical outcomes in adults treated with an adjunctive ketogenic diet for super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE).Methods: Adults (18 years or older) were treated with a 4:1 (fat: carbohydrate and protein) ratio of enteral KD as adjunctive therapy to pharmacologic seizure suppression in SRSE. Blood and urine samples and clinical measurements were collected at baseline (n = 10), after 1 week (n = 8), and after 2 weeks of KD (n = 5). In addition, urine acetoacetate, serum beta-hydroxybutyrate, lipidomics, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta and IL-6), chemokines (CCL3, CCL4, and CXCL13), and clinical measurements were obtained at these three time points. Univariate and multivariate data analyses were performed to determine the correlation between ketone body production and circulating lipids, inflammatory biomarkers, and clinical outcomes.Results: Changes in lipids included an increase in ceramides, mono-hexosylceramide, sphingomyelin, phosphocholine, and phosphoserines, and there was a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators, IL-6 and CXCL13, seen at 1 and 2 weeks of KD. Higher blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels at baseline correlated with better clinical outcomes; however, ketone body production did not correlate with other variables during treatment. Higher chemokine CCL3 levels following treatment correlated with a longer stay in the intensive care unit and a higher modified Rankin Scale score (worse neurologic disability) at discharge and 6-month follow up.Discussion: Adults receiving an adjunctive enteral ketogenic diet for super-refractory status epilepticus exhibit alterations in select pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipid species that may predict their response to treatment.

KW  - 3D surface reconstruction
KW  - Graph convolutional neural network
KW  - Topology modification
KW  - End-to-end framework
AB  - Traditional computed tomography (CT) methods for 3D reconstruction face resolution limitations and require time-consuming post-processing workflows. While deep learning techniques improve the accuracy of segmentation, traditional voxel-based segmentation and surface reconstruction pipelines tend to introduce artifacts such as disconnected regions, topological inconsistencies, and stepped distortions. To overcome these challenges, we propose ToPoMesh, an end-to-end 3D mesh reconstruction deep learning framework for direct reconstruction of high-fidelity surface meshes from CT volume data. To address the existing problems, our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) accurate local and global shape modeling by preserving and enhancing local feature information through residual connectivity and self-attention mechanisms in graph convolutional networks; (2) an adaptive variant density (Avd) mesh de-pooling strategy, which dynamically optimizes the vertex distribution; (3) a topology modification module that iteratively prunes the error surfaces and boundary smoothing via variable regularity terms to obtain finer mesh surfaces. Experiments on the LiTS, MSD pancreas tumor, MSD hippocampus, and MSD spleen datasets demonstrate that ToPoMesh outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate a 57.4% reduction in Chamfer distance (liver) and a 0.47% improvement in F-score compared to end-to-end 3D reconstruction methods, while qualitative results confirm enhanced fidelity for thin structures and complex anatomical topologies versus segmentation frameworks. Importantly, our method eliminates the need for manual post-processing, realizes the ability to reconstruct 3D meshes from images, and can provide precise guidance for surgical planning and diagnosis.

AB  - Introduction: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is an acute brain dysfunction secondary to systemic infection, occurring without direct central nervous system involvement. Despite its clinical relevance, reliable biomarkers for diagnosing SAE and assessing its severity remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI as a non-invasive molecular imaging technique for detecting metabolic alterations related to neuroinflammation in SAE. Using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced rat model, we focused on hippocampal changes associated with neuronal inflammation. Materials and Methods: Twenty-one Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks old, male) were divided into three groups: control (CTRL, n = 7), LPS-induced sepsis at 5 mg/kg (LPS05, n = 7), and 10 mg/kg (LPS10, n = 7). Sepsis was induced via a single intraperitoneal injection of LPS. APTw imaging was performed using a 7 T preclinical MRI system, and signal quantification in the hippocampus was conducted using the magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry analysis. Results and Discussion: APTw imaging at 7 T demonstrated significantly elevated hippocampal APTw signals in SAE model rats (LPS05 and LPS10) compared to the control (CTRL) group: CTRL (-1.940 +/- 0.207%) vs. LPS05 (-0.472 +/- 0.485%) (p < 0.001) and CTRL vs. LPS10 (-0.491 +/- 0.279%) (p < 0.001). However, no statistically significant difference was observed between the LPS05 and LPS10 groups (p = 0.994). These results suggest that APTw imaging can effectively detect neuroinflammation-related metabolic alterations in the hippocampus. Conclusion: Our findings support the feasibility of APTw CEST imaging as a non-invasive molecular MRI technique for SAE, with potential applications in diagnosis, disease monitoring, and therapeutic evaluation.

AB  - Introduction: Electrical stimulation, the application of an electric field to cells and tissues grown in culture to accelerate growth and tight junction formation among endothelial cells, could be impactful in cardiovascular tissue engineering, allotransplantation, and wound healing.Methods: Using Electrical Cell Stimulation And Recording Apparatus (ECSARA), the exploration of the stimulatory influences of electric fields of different magnitude and frequencies on growth and proliferation, trans endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and gene expression of human endothelia cells (HUVECs) were explored.Results: Within the range of endogenous electrical pulses studied, frequency was found to be more significant (p = 0.05) than voltage in influencing HUVEC gene expression. Localization of Yes Associated Protein (YAP) and expression of CD-144 are shown to be consistent with temporal manifestations of TEER.Discussion: This work introduces the field of electromics, the study of cellular gene expression profiles and their implications under the influence of exogenously applied electric fields. Homology of electrobiology and mechanobiology suggests use of such exogenous cues in tissue and regenerative engineering.

AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to explore the impact and mechanism of Scutellariae radix (SR), dried root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi of Labiatae, on prenatal stress (PS)-induced anxiety-like and depression-like behavior in the offspring in a mouse prenatal stress model. Methods: The open field test (OFT), tail suspension test (TST), and forced swimming test (FST) were utilized to assess the behavior of the offspring. Histological changes were evaluated using HE staining and Nissl staining. ELISA was employed to detect the levels of related factors in the serum and fetal brains of offspring mice. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expressions of doublecortin and neurotrophic factors in the hippocampus, and RT-PCR reflected the expression of factors in the hippocampus and placenta of offspring mice. These various techniques collectively provided insight into the neurodevelopmental status by detecting indicators related to neurodevelopmental status. LC-MS/MS and molecular docking were used to clarify the chemical constituents and the pharmacodynamic components in S. radix. Results:S. radix ameliorated prenatal stress-induced anxiety-like and depression-like behavior in the offspring. It also alleviated hippocampal neurogenesis impairment caused by prenatal stress and restored abnormal expression of hippocampal glutamate (Glu) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the offspring. Additionally, S. radix maintained normal 11 beta-HSD1 expression in the placenta of prenatal stress mice, ensuring a normal level of glucocorticoids (GCs) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in the fetus. Furthermore, S. radix increased the mRNA expression of GR and 11 beta-HSD2 while decreasing the mRNA expression of 11 beta-HSD1, thereby normalizing levels of serum CRH, ACTH, and GC in the offspring. Finally, docking results indicated that baicalein, wogonin, wogonoside, and baicalin exhibited stronger binding ability with the target. Conclusion: The results of our study indicate that S. radix may have the potential to alleviate prenatal stress-induced anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors in offspring, at least partially through protecting placental barrier function, reversing HPA axis hyperfunction, and ameliorating neurodevelopmental dysfunction.

AB  - The study of an organism's response to ischemia at different levels is essential to understand the mechanism of the injury as well as protection. We used the occlusion of four vessels as an animal model of global cerebral ischemia to investigate metabolic alterations in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, blood plasma, as well as in a remote organ, the heart, in rats undergoing 24 h postischemic reperfusion. By inducing sublethal ischemic stimuli, we focused on endogenous phenomena known as ischemic tolerance that is currently the best known and most effective way of protecting against ischemic injury. NMR spectroscopy was used to analyze relative metabolite levels in homogenates from rats' cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and heart together with deproteinized blood plasma. In individual animals subjected to global cerebral ischemia, relative concentrations of the essential amino acids isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine in cerebral cortex correlated with those in blood plasma (p < 0.05, or boundary significant p < 0.09). This did not apply for the hippocampus, suggesting a closer relation between ischemic cortex and metabolomic blood components. Hippocampal non-participation on correlation with blood components may emphasize the observed partial or full normalization the post-ischemically altered levels of a number of metabolites in the preconditioned animals. Remarkably, that was observed for cortex to a lesser extent. As a response to the global cerebral ischemia in heart tissue, we observed decreased glutamate and increased 3-hydroxybutyrate. Ischemically induced semi-ketotic state and other changes found in blood plasma partially normalized when ischemic preconditioning was introduced. Some metabolomic changes were so strong that even individual metabolites were able to differentiate between ischemic, ischemically preconditioned, and control brain tissues.

AB  - a-Farnesene, a type of acyclic sesquiterpene, is an important raw material in agriculture, aircraft fuel, and the chemical industry. In this study, we constructed an efficient a-farnesene-producing yeast cell factory by combining enzyme and metabolic engineering strategies. First, we screened different plants for a-farnesene synthase (AFS) with the best activity and found that AFS from Camellia sinensis (CsAFS) exhibited the most efficient a-farnesene production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 4741. Second, the metabolic flux of the mevalonate pathway was increased to improve the supply of the precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate. Third, inducing site-directed mutagenesis in CsAFS, the CsAFS(W281C) variant was obtained, which considerably increased a-farnesene production. Fourth, the N-terminal serine-lysine-isoleucine-lysine (SKIK) tag was introduced to construct the SKIK similar to CsAFS(W281C) variant, which further increased a-farnesene production to 2.8 g/L in shake-flask cultures. Finally, the a-farnesene titer of 28.3 g/L in S. cerevisiae was obtained by fed-batch fermentation in a 5 L bioreactor.

AB  - Protein aggregation is a multifaceted phenomenon prevalent in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, yielding aggregates of diverse sizes. Recently, increased attention has been directed towards early protein aggregates due to their pronounced toxicity, largely stemming from inflammation mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study advocates for a therapeutic approach focusing on inflammation control rather than mere ROS inhibition in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we introduced Camellia sinensis cellulose nanoonion (CS-CNO) as an innovative, biocompatible nanocarrier for encapsulating the phytosteroid diosgenin (DGN@CS-CNO). The resulting nano-assembly, manifesting as spherical entities with dimensions averaging similar to 180-220 nm, exhibits a remarkable capacity for the gradual and sustained release of approximately 39-44 % of DGN over a 60-hour time frame. DGN@CS-CNO displays a striking ability to inhibit or disassemble various phases of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) protein aggregates, including the early (HEWLEA) and late (HEWLLA) stages. In vitro experiments employing HEK293 cells underscore the potential of DGN@CS-CNO in mitigating cell death provoked by protein aggregation. This effect is achieved by ameliorating ROS-mediated inflammation and countering mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by alterations in TNF alpha, TLR4, and MT-CO1 protein expression. Western blot analyses reveal that the gradual and sustained release of DGN from DGN@CS-CNO induces autophagy, a pivotal process in dismantling intracellular amyloid deposits. In summary, this study not only illuminates a path forward but also presents a compelling case for the utilization of phytosteroid as a formidable strategy against neuroinflammation incited by protein aggregation.

AB  - IntroductionOur brain is bombarded by a diverse range of visual stimuli, which are converted into corresponding neuronal responses and processed throughout the visual system. The neural activity patterns that result from these external stimuli vary depending on the object or scene being observed, but they also change as a result of internal or behavioural states. This raises the question of to what extent it is possible to predict the presented visual stimuli from neural activity across behavioural states, and how this varies in different brain regions.MethodsTo address this question, we assessed the computational capacity of decoders to extract visual information in awake behaving mice, by analysing publicly available standardised datasets from the Allen Brain Institute. We evaluated how natural movie frames can be distinguished based on the activity of units recorded in distinct brain regions and under different behavioural states. This analysis revealed the spectrum of visual information present in different brain regions in response to binary and multiclass classification tasks.ResultsVisual cortical areas showed highest classification accuracies, followed by thalamic and midbrain regions, with hippocampal regions showing close to chance accuracy. In addition, we found that behavioural variability led to a decrease in decoding accuracy, whereby large behavioural changes between train and test sessions reduced the classification performance of the decoders. A generalised linear model analysis suggested that this deterioration in classification might be due to an independent modulation of neural activity by stimulus and behaviour. Finally, we reconstructed the natural movie frames from optimal linear classifiers, and observed a strong similarity between reconstructed and actual movie frames. However, the similarity was significantly higher when the decoders were trained and tested on sessions with similar behavioural states.ConclusionOur analysis provides a systematic assessment of visual coding in the mouse brain, and sheds light on the spectrum of visual information present across brain areas and behavioural states.

AB  - The brain constantly adapts to environmental changes by modifying the expression of genes that enable synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. The expression of several of these genes requires nuclear calcium (Ca2+) signals, which in turn requires that Ca2+ signals generated by neuronal activity at the synapses or the soma propagate to the nucleus. Since cytoplasmic Ca2+ diffusion is highly restricted, Ca2+ signal propagation to the nucleus requires the participation of other cellular mechanisms. The inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels, both of which reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, play key roles in cellular Ca2+ signal generation. Yet, their roles in the generation of nuclear and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals induced by neuronal activity require further investigation. Here, the impact of IP3R1 or RyR2 knockdown on gabazine-induced nuclear and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals in neurons was evaluated. To this aim, recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) were used to introduce small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to knockdown type-1 (IP3R1) and type-2 (RyR2) channel expression in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Additionally, synaptic contact numbers were assessed through immunocytochemistry. Knockdown of IP3R1 or RyR2 channels significantly reduced their protein contents and the generation of gabazine-induced nuclear and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals, without altering synaptic contact numbers. Our results highlight the contribution of IP3R1 and RyR2 channels to the generation of nuclear and mitochondrial Ca2+ signal induced by neuronal activity, reinforcing the role that these Ca2+ release channels play in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory formation.

TI  - COVID-19 Classification from Chest X-Ray Images: A Framework of Deep Explainable Artificial Intelligence

KW  - SEGMENTATION
KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - COVID-19 detection and classification using chest X-ray images is a current hot research topic based on the important application known as medical image analysis. To halt the spread of COVID-19, it is critical to identify the infection as soon as possible. Due to time constraints and the expertise of radiologists, manually diagnosing this infection from chest X-ray images is a difficult and time-consuming process. Artificial intelligence techniques have had a significant impact on medical image analysis and have also introduced several techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. Deep learning and explainable AI have shown significant popularity among AL techniques for COVID-19 detection and classification. In this work, we propose a deep learning and explainable AI technique for the diagnosis and classification of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. Initially, a hybrid contrast enhancement technique is proposed and applied to the original images that are later utilized for the training of two modified deep learning models. The deep transfer learning concept is selected for the training of pretrained modified models that are later employed for feature extraction. Features of both deep models are fused using improved canonical correlation analysis that is further optimized using a hybrid algorithm named Whale-Elephant Herding. Through this algorithm, the best features are selected and classified using an extreme learning machine (ELM). Moreover, the modified deep models are utilized for Grad-CAM visualization. The experimental process was conducted on three publicly available datasets and achieved accuracies of 99.1, 98.2, and 96.7%, respectively. Moreover, the ablation study was performed and showed that the proposed accuracy is better than the other methods.

AB  - The development of biologically realistic models of brain microcircuits and regions constitutes currently a very relevant topic in computational neuroscience. One of the main challenges of such models is the passage between different scales, going from the microscale (cellular) to the meso (microcircuit) and macroscale (region or whole-brain level), while keeping at the same time a constraint on the demand of computational resources. In this paper we introduce a multiscale modeling framework for the hippocampal CA1, a region of the brain that plays a key role in functions such as learning, memory consolidation and navigation. Our modeling framework goes from the single cell level to the macroscale and makes use of a novel mean-field model of CA1, introduced in this paper, to bridge the gap between the micro and macro scales. We test and validate the model by analyzing the response of the system to the main brain rhythms observed in the hippocampus and comparing our results with the ones of the corresponding spiking network model of CA1. Then, we analyze the implementation of synaptic plasticity within our framework, a key aspect to study the role of hippocampus in learning and memory consolidation, and we demonstrate the capability of our framework to incorporate the variations at synaptic level. Finally, we present an example of the implementation of our model to study a stimulus propagation at the macro-scale level, and we show that the results of our framework can capture the dynamics obtained in the corresponding spiking network model of the whole CA1 area.

AB  - Introduction: Brand equity plays a crucial role in a brand's commercial success; however, research on the brain regions associated with brand equity has had mixed results. This study aimed to investigate key brain regions associated with the decision-making of branded and unbranded foods using quantitative neuroimaging meta-analysis and machine learning. Methods: Quantitative neuroimaging meta-analysis was performed using the activation likelihood method. Activation of the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) overlapped between branded and unbranded foods. The lingual and parahippocampal gyri (PHG) were activated in the case of branded foods, whereas no brain regions were characteristically activated in response to unbranded foods. We proposed a novel predictive method based on the reported foci data, referencing the multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) results. This approach is referred to as the multi-coordinate pattern analysis (MCPA). We conducted the MCPA, adopting the sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) to detect unique brain regions associated with branded and unbranded foods based on coordinate data. The sPLS-DA is an extended PLS method that enables the processing of categorical data as outcome variables. Results: We found that the lingual gyrus is a distinct brain region in branded foods. Thus, the VMPFC might be a core brain region in food categories in consumer behavior, regardless of whether they are branded foods. Moreover, the connection between the PHG and lingual gyrus might be a unique neural mechanism in branded foods. Discussion: As this mechanism engages in imaging the feature-self based on emotionally subjective contextual associative memories, brand managers should create future-oriented relevancies between brands and consumers to build valuable brands.

AB  - The combination and integration of multimodal imaging and clinical markers have introduced numerous classifiers to improve diagnostic accuracy in detecting and predicting AD; however, many studies cannot ensure the homogeneity of data sets and consistency of results. In our study, the XGBoost algorithm was used to classify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normal control (NC) populations through five rs-fMRI analysis datasets. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is used to analyze the interpretability of the model. The highest accuracy for diagnosing MCI was 65.14% (using the mPerAF dataset). The characteristics of the left insula, right middle frontal gyrus, and right cuneus correlated positively with the output value using DC datasets. The characteristics of left cerebellum 6, right inferior frontal gyrus, opercular part, and vermis 6 correlated positively with the output value using fALFF datasets. The characteristics of the right middle temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, left temporal pole, and middle temporal gyrus correlated positively with the output value using mPerAF datasets. The characteristics of the right middle temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, and left hippocampus correlated positively with the output value using PerAF datasets. The characteristics of left cerebellum 9, vermis 9, and right precentral gyrus, right amygdala, and left middle occipital gyrus correlated positively with the output value using Wavelet-ALFF datasets. We found that the XGBoost algorithm constructed from rs-fMRI data is effective for the diagnosis and classification of MCI. The accuracy rates obtained by different rs-fMRI data analysis methods are similar, but the important features are different and involve multiple brain regions, which suggests that MCI may have a negative impact on brain function.

AB  - Introduction: Doping and steroid use represent a serious threat to animal health and can even lead to their untimely and painful death. However, doping is an acute problem in today's animal racing world, particularly in camel racing. Testosterone and its ten esters (benzoate, valerate, isocaproate, hexahydrobenzoate, decanoate, undecanoate, laurate, enanthate, cypionate, and caproate) are of utmost importance, because when they are administered to animals it is difficult to measure them efficiently. The levels of testosterone and its esters in camels and other animals are typically determined using urine and blood tests. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method to determine testosterone esters in camel hair, and to apply the validated method to determine testosterone esters in collected samples. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such research. Results and Discussion: The levels of testosterone and its ten derivatives, along with the cortisol-D4 internal standard, were optimised for LC-MS/MS analysis; however, only testosterone along with its seven esters (namely benzoate, valerate, isocaproate, hexahydrobenzoate, decanoate, undecanoate and laurate) could be validated in camel hair. Only five testosterone esters could be determined in camel hair samples; the concentrations were obtained as 10.5-14.9 pg/mg for valerate (in three camels), 12.5-151.6 pg/mg for hexahydrobenzoate (in six camels), 4.8-32.1 pg/mg for laurate (in five camels), 5.1 pg/mg decanoate (in one camel), and 8.35-169 pg/mg for testosterone (in all 24 camels). Interestingly, the three racing camels displayed high concentrations of testosterone (59.2-169 pg/mg, all three camels), laurate (4.8-14.5 pg/mg, two camels), hexahydrobenzoate (116 pg/mg, one camel), decanoate (5.1 pg/mg, one camel), and valerate (11.7 pg/mg, one camel). Methods: Camel hair samples were collected from 21 non-racing dromedary camels along with three racing camels in Al Ain, UAE; these were decontaminated, pulverised, sonicated, and extracted prior to analysis. An LC-MS/MS method was employed to determine the levels of testosterone esters in the hair samples. Conclusions: This novel camel-hair test procedure is accurate, sensitive, rapid, and robust. The findings reported in this study could be significant to evaluate racing camels for suspected doping offenses. Further controlled testosterone supplementation studies are required to evaluate individual esters' effects on camel health and diseases and on performance enhancement levels. This new hair test could promote further studies in doping control, toxicology, and pharmacology, as well as having other clinical applications relating to camel health, injury, and disease.

AB  - We introduce a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to reduce grains' manual inspection time after image processing on raw 3D x-ray computed tomography (3DXRCT) images from a sample of granular material to obtain level-set function-based digital twins of individual grains. The CNN automatically distinguishes properly segmented digital grains with up to 90% of accuracy. This algorithm is trained using, ground-truth, level set-based digital grain representations from a natural soil sampled at Jaramijo (Ecuador). The implemented convolutional neural network provides groundbreaking processing power, reducing the, otherwise, manual inspection time expended for a small sample, e.g., 200 000 grains, from approximately a couple of weeks to only a few hours. Furthermore, transfer learning and training from scratch are compared for artificially graded granular materials such as oysand (Norway) and Hostun sand (France). The CNN's learning process is interpreted by means of grain morphological parameters, i.e., sphericity, roundness, grain diameter, and volume-surface ratio. Hence, being able to automatically segment a greater amount of grains from 3DXRCT images of natural and artificial soils in a short period of time, enables us, for first time, to perform actual 3DLS-DEM-based virtual laboratory testing (a plug-and-play one-stop shop). Providing unprecedented and unique data for engineering applications.

AB  - We previously introduced the brain erythropoietin (EPO) circle as a model to explain the adaptive 'brain hardware upgrade' and enhanced performance. In this fundamental circle, brain cells, challenged by motor-cognitive tasks, experience functional hypoxia, triggering the expression of EPO among other genes. We attested hypoxic cells by a transgenic reporter approach under the ubiquitous CAG promoter, with Hif-1 alpha oxygen-dependent degradation-domain (ODD) fused to CreERT2-recombinase. To specifically focus on the functional hypoxia of excitatory pyramidal neurons, here, we generated CaMKII alpha-CreERT2-ODD::R26R-tdTomato mice. Behavioral challenges, light-sheet microscopy, immunohistochemistry, single-cell mRNA-seq, and neuronal cultures under normoxia or hypoxia served to portray these mice. Upon complex running wheel performance as the motor-cognitive task, a distinct increase in functional hypoxic neurons was assessed immunohistochemically and confirmed three-dimensionally. In contrast, fear conditioning as hippocampal stimulus was likely too short-lived to provoke neuronal hypoxia. Transcriptome data of hippocampus under normoxia versus inspiratory hypoxia revealed increases in CA1 CaMKII alpha-neurons with an immature signature, characterized by the expression of Dcx, Tbr1, CaMKII alpha, Tle4, and Zbtb20, and consistent with accelerated differentiation. The hypoxia reporter response was reproduced in vitro upon neuronal maturation. To conclude, task-associated activity triggers neuronal functional hypoxia as a local and brain-wide reaction mediating adaptive neuroplasticity. Hypoxia-induced genes such as EPO drive neuronal differentiation, brain maturation, and improved performance.

AB  - Traditional sanitation practices remain the main strategy for controlling Bombyx mori infections caused by microsporidia Nosema bombycis. This actualizes the development of new approaches to increase the silkworm resistance to this parasite. Here, we constructed a mouse scFv library against the outer loops of N. bombycis ATP/ADP carriers and selected nine scFv fragments to the transporter, highly expressed in the early stages of the parasite intracellular growth. Expression of selected scFv genes in Sf9 cells, their infection with different ratios of microsporidia spores per insect cell, qPCR analysis of N. bombycis PTP2 and Spodoptera frugiperda COXI transcripts in 100 infected cultures made it possible to select the scFv fragment most effectively inhibiting the parasite growth. Western blot analysis of 42 infected cultures with Abs against the parasite beta-tubulin confirmed its inhibitory efficiency. Since the VL part of this scFv fragment was identified as a human IgG domain retained from the pSEX81 phagemid during library construction, its VH sequence should be a key antigen-recognizing determinant. Along with the further selection of new recombinant Abs, this suggests the searching for its natural mouse VL domain or "camelization" of the VH fragment by introducing cysteine and hydrophilic residues, as well as the randomization of its CDRs.

AB  - To better assess the practical value and avoid potential risks of the traditionally medicinal and edible basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune, which may arise from undescribed metabolites, a combination of elicitors was introduced for the first time to discover products from cryptic and low-expressed gene clusters under laboratory cultivation. Treating S. commune NJFU21 with the combination of five elicitors led to the upregulated production of a class of unusual linear diterpene-derived variants, including eleven new ones (1-11), along with three known ones (12-14). The structures and stereochemistry were determined by 1D and 2D NMR, HRESIMS, ECD, OR and VCD calculations. Notably, the elongation terminus of all the diterpenes was decorated by an unusual butenedioic acid moiety. Compound 1 was a rare monocyclic diterpene, while 2-6 possessed a tetrahydrofuran moiety. The truncated metabolites 4, 5 and 13 belong to the trinorditerpenes. All the diterpenes displayed approximately 70% scavenging of hydroxyl radicals at 50 mu M and null cytotoxic activity at 10 mu M. In addition, compound 1 exhibited potent antifungal activity against the plant pathogenic fungi Colletotrichum camelliae, with MIC values of 8 mu g/mL. Our findings indicated that this class of diterpenes could provide valuable protectants for cosmetic ingredients and the lead compounds for agricultural fungicide development.

AB  - Brown planthopper (BPH), a monophagous phloem feeder, consumes a large amount of photoassimilates in rice and causes wilting. A near-isogenic line 'TNG71-Bph45' was developed from the Oryza sativa japonica variety 'Tainung 71 (TNG71) carrying a dominant BPH-resistance locus derived from Oryza nivara (IRGC 102165) near the centromere of chromosome 4. We compared the NIL (TNG71-Bph45) and the recurrent parent to explore how the Bph45 gene confers BPH resistance. We found that TNG71-Bph45 is less attractive to BPH at least partially because it produces less limonene. Chiral analysis revealed that the major form of limonene in both rice lines was the L-form. However, both L- and D-limonene attracted BPH when applied exogenously to TNG71-Bph45 rice. The transcript amounts of limonene synthase were significantly higher in TNG71 than in TNG71-Bph45 and were induced by BPH infestation only in the former. Introgression of the Bph45 gene into another japonica variety, Tainan 11, also resulted in a low limonene content. Moreover, several dominantly acting BPH resistance genes introduced into the BPH-sensitive IR24 line compromised its limonene-producing ability and concurrently decreased its attractiveness to BPH. These observations suggest that reducing limonene production may be a common resistance strategy against BPH in rice.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are usually generated by reprogramming differentiated cells through the introduction of specific transcription factors, but this is a difficult and inefficient process. Valproic acid (VPA) is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that significantly improves the efficiency of iPSC generation. But its role and mechanism are still unclear.
   Methods and Results: We transduced Bactrian camel fetal fibroblasts (BCFFs) with retroviruses carrying defined factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC and EGFP; OSKMG) in the presence of VPA. Cells were collected (Day 7) and analyzed using RNA-seq technology. Afterwards, different groups of cells and transcriptomics results were detected by PCR and qRT-PCR technology. The results showed that VPA promoted the expression of the endogenous gene c-Myc and inhibited cell proliferation; at the same time, it promoted the expression of VEGF and other genes related to angiogenesis.
   Conclusions: When VPA is added to the culture medium, only the cells that have begun to reprogram can break the G2/M repression through the expression of the endogenous gene c-Myc, and use the nutrients and space in the culture dish to proliferate normally, which can achieve the purpose of directly improving the efficiency of reprogramming. Another new discovery for Bactrian camels, VPA significantly increased the expression of VEGFC and other genes, promoting the transformation of fibroblasts to endothelial cells (different from the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition process of other species) to accelerate the early induction of Bactrian camels iPSc process. Overall, this study proved the new mechanism of VPA in enhancing the induction of pluripotency from the transcriptome level.

AB  - Numerical simulations and clinical measurements of nasal resistance are in quantitative disagreement. The order of magnitude of this mismatch, that sometimes exceeds 100%, is such that known sources of uncertainty cannot explain it. The goal of the present work is to examine a source of bias introduced by the design of medical devices, which has not been considered until now as a possible explanation. We study the effect of the location of the probe on the rhinomanometer that is meant to measure the ambient pressure. Rhinomanometry is carried out on a 3D silicone model of a patient-specific anatomy; a clinical device and dedicated sensors are employed side-by-side for mutual validation. The same anatomy is also employed for numerical simulations, with approaches spanning a wide range of fidelity levels. We find that the intrinsic uncertainty of the numerical simulations is of minor importance. To the contrary, the position of the pressure tap intended to acquire the external pressure in the clinical device is crucial, and can cause a mismatch comparable to that generally observed between in-silico and in-vivo rhinomanometry data. A source of systematic bias may therefore exist in rhinomanometers, designed under the assumption that measurements of the nasal resistance are unaffected by the flow development within the instruments.

AB  - Real-time and non-invasive monitoring of neuronal differentiation helps to increase understanding of neuronal development and develop stem cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. Conventional methods such as RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence (IF), lack single-cell-level resolution and require invasive procedures, fixation, and staining. These limitations hinder accurate monitoring progress of neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation and understanding its functions. Herein, a novel approach is reported to non-invasively monitor neuronal differentiation in real-time using cell-based biosensors (CBBs) that detects hippocalcin, biomarker of neuronal differentiation. To construct the hippocalcin sensor proteins, two different hippocalcin bioreceptors are fused to each split-intein, carrying split-nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides, respectively, and fluorescent protein is introduced as reporter. CBBs operated in the presence of hippocalcin to generate functional signal peptides, which promptly translocated the fluorescence signal to the nucleus. The NSC-based biosensor shows fluorescence signal translocation only upon neuronal differentiation and not undifferentiated stem cells or glial cells. Furthermore, this approach allows monitoring of neural differentiation at earlier stages than detected using IF staining. It is believed that novel CBBs offer an alternative to current techniques by capturing the dynamics of differentiation progress at the single-cell-level and providing a tool to evaluate how NSCs efficiently differentiate into neurons.
   Novel cell-based biosensor (CBB) is developed to monitor neuronal differentiation in real-time. CBB reports early neurogenesis through translocation of fluorescence signal before expression of TuJ1, key neuronal marker. The ability to capture differentiation dynamics at single-cell-level improves the capability to examine and control neuronal development. Its non-invasiveness can be valuable to investigate neurodegenerative diseases and promote advances in cell therapy. image

AB  - Theta-band oscillations (3-8 Hz) in the mammalian hippocampus organize the temporal structure of cortical inputs, resulting in a phase code that enables rhythmic input sampling for episodic memory formation and spatial navigation. However, it remains unclear what evolutionary pressures might have driven the selection of theta over higher-frequency bands that could potentially provide increased input sampling resolution. Here, we address this question by introducing a theoretical framework that combines the efficient coding and neural oscillatory sampling hypotheses, focusing on the information rate (bits/s) of phase coding neurons. We demonstrate that physiologically realistic noise levels create a trade-off between the speed of input sampling, determined by oscillation frequency, and encoding precision in rodent hippocampal neurons. This speed-precision trade-off results in a maximum information rate of similar to 1-2 bits/s within the theta frequency band, thus confining the optimal oscillation frequency to the low end of the spectrum. We also show that this framework accounts for key hippocampal features, such as the preservation of the theta band along the dorsoventral axis despite physiological gradients, and the modulation of theta frequency and amplitude by running speed. Extending the analysis beyond the hippocampus, we propose that theta oscillations could also support efficient stimulus encoding in the visual cortex and olfactory bulb. More broadly, our framework lays the foundation for studying how system features, such as noise, constrain the optimal sampling frequencies in both biological and artificial brains.

AB  - We propose the "runtime learning" hypothesis which states that people quickly learn to perform unfamiliar tasks as the tasks arise by using task-relevant instances of concepts stored in memory during mental training. To make learning rapid, the hypothesis claims that only a few class instances are used, but these instances are especially valuable for training. The paper motivates the hypothesis by describing related ideas from the cognitive science and machine learning literatures. Using computer simulation, we show that deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn effectively from small, curated training sets, and that valuable training items tend to lie toward the centers of data item clusters in an abstract feature space. In a series of three behavioral experiments, we show that people can also learn effectively from small, curated training sets. Critically, we find that participant reaction times and fitted drift rates are best accounted for by the confidences of DNNs trained on small datasets of highly valuable items. We conclude that the runtime learning hypothesis is a novel conjecture about the relationship between learning and memory with the potential for explaining a wide variety of cognitive phenomena.
   Human cognition is remarkably flexible, with the ability to reliably perform a wide variety of tasks, including idiosyncratic and unfamiliar ones, in a wide variety of contexts. However, despite impressive advances in machine learning, leading to artificial intelligences capable of outperforming humans on select individual tasks, this flexibility has yet to be replicated by computational models. Doing so is essential to both creating general artificial intelligence and to achieving a deeper understanding of the human brain and mind. To account for this vital property of human cognition, we introduce the "runtime learning hypothesis", in which the brain rapidly constructs task-specific models in response to the needs of the moment using an internal training process based on valuable exemplars of the relevant concepts. We examine the plausibility of this hypothesis using human behavioral experiments and machine-learning-based computational modeling. The results are consistent with the human brain using runtime learning to flexibly perform tasks.

AB  - Introduction Numerous clinical data and animal models demonstrate that many patients with neuropathic pain suffer from concomitant depressive symptoms.Methods Massive evidence from biological experiments has verified that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and other brain regions play an influential role in the co-morbidity of neuropathic pain and depression, but the mechanism by which neuropathic pain induces depression remains unclear.Results In this study, we mined existing publicly available databases of high-throughput sequencing data intending to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the process of neuropathic pain-induced depression.Conclusion This study provides a rudimentary exploration of the mechanism of neuropathic pain-induced depression and provides credible evidence for its management and precaution.

AB  - The YES-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are two important transcriptional coactivators that are often aberrantly activated in cancer cells. Their dysregulation promotes cancer development and can confer resistance to anticancer therapies. Therefore, the pharmacological inhibition of YAP/TAZ presents a promising approach for treating tumors with heightened YAP/TAZ activity. However, the clinical use of a known YAP/TAZ inhibitor, niflumic acid (NA), is limited by its poor in vivo half-life. To improve its bioavailability, we developed a series of NA-based prodrug polymers and investigated the impact of NA monomer units on the physicochemical properties of their self-assembled nanoparticles. The optimal pNA polymer was selected as a prodrug micellar nanocarrier to load hydrophobic receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) for combination therapy. The nanocarrier selectively accumulated in the tumor and synergistically inhibited tumor growth with the cargo RTKIs, particularly Dasatinib, introducing a nanocombination therapy enhanced breast cancer treatment.

AB  - Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) is one of the primary virulence factors of Staphylococcus aureus but there is still a lack of targeted drugs. SEB activates immune cells via interacting with MHC-II on antigen-presenting cells, leading to the production of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Blocking the interaction between SEB and MHC-II can avert the overactivation of immune cells. Nanobodies are the smallest functional antibodies that can bind stably to antigens. In this study, an ideal approach to obtain specific nanobodies without immunizing camelids was introduced. We constructed a library containing up to 5 x 108 nanobodies, and then screened those targeting SEB by using yeast surface display (YSD) technique and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). A total of 8 nanobodies with divergent complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) sequences were identified and one candidate Nb8 with high affinity to SEB was isolated. In vitro study demonstrated that Nb8 significantly inhibited SEB-induced inflammatory response. Molecular docking simulation indicated that the unique CDR3 sequence contributed to the binding of Nb8 to the MHC-II binding domain of SEB and accordingly cut off the connection between SEB and MHC-II. Our efforts contributed to the development of specific nanobodies for eliminating the threats of SEB.

AB  - Cancer is considered as one of the main causes of human deaths and a global health challenge. Despite the therapeutic and diagnostic progresses, there is a high rate of mortality among cancer patients. Late diagnosis is one of the most important reasons of high mortality rate, which is mainly due to the lack of efficient and noninvasive diagnostic methods to monitor cancer patients. Therefore, the introduction of non-invasive markers can play an effective role in the early diagnosis and better therapeutic management in these patients. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have critical functions in regulation of various physiological and pathophysiological cellular processes. Deregulation of miRNAs has been frequently reported in different tumor types. On the other hand, due to the high stability of these factors in body fluids, these factors can be used as the non-invasive tumor markers. In this study, for the first time, we discussed the role of miR-185 during tumor progression. It has been reported that miR-185 mainly functions as a tumor suppressor through the regulation of PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, TGF-& beta;, Hippo, and WNT signaling pathways as well as the transcription factors and cell cycle components. PI3K/AKT was reported as the main oncogenic signaling pathway that can be inhibited by miR-185 during tumor progression. Therefore, miR-185/PI3K/AKT axis can be suggested as a probable target in tumor therapy that requires further animal studies. The present review can be an effective step towards introducing the miR-185 as a non-invasive diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target in cancer patients.
