AB  - Wildlife management on a landscape scale is often complex, particularly where different land use practices occur in the same region. This is particularly so for the management of overabundant grazing species (both domestic and native) in a modified landscape, where anthropogenic activities and climatic drivers can influence their distribution and abundance beyond sustainable levels. In Australia's arid rangelands, macropods benefit from pastoral activities including improved pastures, artificial watering points and the removal of apex predators. This paper addresses some of the challenges associated with managing Red Kangaroo (Osphranter rufus) in a conservation context on the privately managed Boolcoomatta Station conservation reserve in the South Australian arid rangelands. We reflect on the history of the region and how anthropogenic activities, associated with an unpredictable climate, have made macropod management so complex. Ecological monitoring at Boolcoomatta Station suggests that, along with the influence of rainfall, grazing by overabundant Red Kangaroo had a negative impact on vegetation and resident avifauna of chenopod plains. Fenced exclosures further demonstrate the grazing impact of Red Kangaroo, with perennial grasses found only where grazing was excluded. The closure of waterpoints (dams) failed to reduce Red Kangaroo impacts on the reserve, despite some evidence that persistence of Red Kangaroo near fenced dams may be reduced in the long term. Results of monitoring and management outcomes at Boolcoomatta highlight the need for an improved framework to manage Red Kangaroo. This should include consideration of improved regional stock management practices in the face of climate change; improving our understanding of the role of apex predators in agricultural landscapes; developing and setting grazing impact thresholds to instigate macropod management; improving and standardizing monitoring methods for assessing impacts; and lastly, consideration of the mental health and social well-being of land managers in these areas.

AB  - The coexistence of multiple species competing for a finite set of resources is a widely debated topic in community ecology. Species with strongly overlapping niches are expected to drive each other towards exclusion, but such species may also coexist if they have similar competitive abilities. This compromise can lead to a peculiar pattern of clumped coexistence, where multiple species share similar niches, leaving gaps open in the theoretically available niche space. Large mammal herbivores may be a good example of this, where species' dietary niches clump as either grazers, browsers, or intermediate-feeders, rather than being continuously distributed over the resource gradient. Here, we develop a model of such emergent neutrality amongst species competing for a set of predefined resources each distributed along a finite niche axis. The model is commensurate with stable isotope niches, thus allowing us to compare its predictions with empirical evidence for changes in community niche structure over evolutionary time. We present stable carbon and oxygen isotope evidence for six discontinuous Late Quaternary assemblages from the central interior of South Africa, demonstrating the emergence of a clumped niche structure from an initial pattern of strongly overlapping diets. We show that species tend to cluster on parts of the niche axis where resource availability is highest, mirroring the proliferation of grazer species as landscapes became more grass-dominated. However, the presence of competition means that species' niches continue to differentiate, explaining the persistence of browser and intermediate-feeder species even in these open, predominantly treeless landscapes. These results highlight that species interactions are a necessary factor for robust inferences about the evolutionary dynamics of palaeocommunities.

AB  - Sa similar to o Tome ' (Gulf of Guinea, Central Africa) is a 854 km2 tropical island that had a pivotal role in early European colonial expansion through the Atlantic between the 15th and 16th centuries. Historical sources suggest that native vegetation has been heavily impacted since human arrival (1470 CE) due to monoculture economies and the introduction of mammals and plants, some of which now have established wild populations. The Afro-montane forest of Sa similar to o Tome ', located above 800 m.a.sl., is particularly rich in endemic plant species and has remained relatively unaffected by direct human impacts. Here, we explore how environmental change influenced this forest through the study of a sedimentary sequence from the volcanic crater of Lagoa Ame ' lia (1340 m a.s.l.), a palustrine system located at the boundary between submontane (800-1400 m a.s.l.) and mist forest (above 1400 m a.s.l.). We used fossil pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, sedimentology and charcoal to determine forest dynamics from the Late Pleistocene to the present. From 14,000 to 12,500 cal yr BP the forest was dominated by taxa from higher altitudes, adapted to cooler and drier climates (e.g. Afrocarpus mannii trees and Psychotria nubicola). After 12,500 cal yr BP, a potential uphill migration was identified by an increase in taxa like the trees Symphonia globulifera and Craterispermum cerinanthum. From 11,200 cal yr BP through the rest of the Holocene taxa from lower altitudes became dominant (e.g. Prunus africana, Polyscias, and Sabicea), except at c. 8500 cal yr BP when rapid cooling led to forest opening. Charcoal showed that fires were frequent during the Late Pleis-tocene (14,000 to 11,200 cal yr BP), becoming rare during the Holocene until anthropogenic fires started at c. 220 cal yr BP. Other recent anthropogenic impacts detected in Lagoa Ame ' lia included the appearance of pollen of introduced plant species (e.g., Cestrum), and the increase in pollen of economically important species (Elaeis guineensis, Zea mays) and in fungal spores related to introduced herbivores. Our results reveal that climate changed the altitudinal distribution of the Afromontane forest in Sa similar to o Tome ' during the Late Pleistocene, as observed on the African continent, and that this ecosystem was also strongly impacted by human arrival, through fire, farming, and introduced species.

AB  - We present a continuous-7000-year sedimentary record from Lashmars Lagoon, Kangaroo Island (Karti/Karta), southern Australia, a region heavily impacted by drought and bushfires in recent decades. Records such as this are vital to contextualise current climatic and environmental shifts, particularly regarding the interplay between hydroclimate and fire-related disturbances in this ecologically sensitive area. We use high-resolution mu X-ray fluorescence core scanning, complemented by bulk organic geochemistry and X-ray diffraction mineralogy of catchment soil and lake sediments to reconstruct past climate and catchment processes. Phases of elevated sediment organic matter content (inferred from high Br and total organic carbon) suggest increased lake freshening and productivity, and coincide with increased chemical weathering (inferred from high Al/K and kaolinite/illite and feldspars), likely reflecting the influence of wetter climates. Conversely, periods of high Ca correlate with biogenic carbonate inputs typical of brackish conditions, which we attribute to drier climates or a marine influence. From 7.0 ka, at the mid-Holocene sea level highstand, until 5.7 ka, we suspect Lashmars Lagoon was under virtually continuous influence from the sea. At 5.7 ka, we interpret the abrupt increase in sediment total organic carbon to reflect the severance of the connection to the sea, allowing organic material to accumulate. This, coupled with evidence of high inferred chemical weathering, suggests the climate was rela-tively wet at the time. After 5.4 ka, our data point to the establishment of drier conditions until the commencement of wetter climates again at 4.5 ka. From 2.5 ka, however, drier climates prevailed again until present. Notably, the climate changes recorded in the sedimentary sequence at Lashmars Lagoon seem to be linked to the strength of the Leeuwin Current, a current that brings warm tropical waters to southern Australia and demonstrates a teleconnection with the El Nin similar to o Southern Oscillation, and may well have been an important driver of rainfall on Kangaroo Island (Karti/Karta) over the past-7000 years.

AB  - The grazing impact on epiphytic lichens by a non-native gastropod species is documented and quantified for the first time in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador using a unique combination of a multiple-choice feeding design with lichen transplant techniques under controlled laboratory conditions. The feeding experiment included three arboreal lichen species sewn onto a mesh and attached to red maple sticks inside a terrarium where four Cepaea nemoralis snails were introduced and allowed to graze over a five-day period. The three lichen species used in the feeding trials included the green-algal Platismatia glauca, the cephalolichen Lobaria pulmonaria, and the cyanolichen Lobarina scrobiculata. The trials also included two sets of L. pulmonaria from different regions of the island of Newfoundland. The levels of grazing and preference by the snails was very high. Herbivory was high for all lichen species but was highest for Platismatia glauca, for which 70% of thalli were consumed after only 24 hours. Our results show that C. nemoralis is probably affecting the distribution and abundance of epiphytic lichens in the forests of Newfoundland and Labrador. Furthermore, our observations of intense herbivory on reproductive structures challenges the universal application of the optimal defence theory in lichens.

AB  - The enemy release hypothesis states that introduced plants have a competitive advantage due to their release from co-evolved natural enemies (i.e., herbivores and pathogens), which allows them to spread rapidly in new environments. This hypothesis has received mixed support to date, but previous studies have rarely examined the herbivore community, plant damage, and performance simultaneously and largely ignored below-ground herbivores. We tested for enemy release by conducting large scale field surveys of insect diversity and abundance in both the native (United Kingdom) and introduced (New Zealand) ranges of three dock (Rumex, Polygonaceae) species: R. conglomeratus Murray (clustered dock), R. crispus L. (curly dock) and R. obtusifolius L. (broad-leaved dock). We captured both above- and below-ground insect herbivores, measured herbivore damage, and plant biomass as an indicator for performance. In the introduced range, Rumex plants had a lower diversity of insect herbivores, all insect specialists present in the native range were absent and plants had lower levels of herbivore damage on both roots and leaves. Despite this, only R. crispus had greater fresh weight in the introduced range compared to the native range. This suggests that enemy release, particularly from below-ground herbivores, could be a driver for the success of R. crispus plants in New Zealand, but not for R. conglomeratus and R. obtusifolius.

AB  - In recent years, the potential of Global Navigation Satellite System Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) for monitoring sea-level variations has been explored extensively. However, most studies have typically selected coastal sites with optimal GNSS-IR observation conditions, often limiting verification to one or two stations and overlooking other viable sites. This study introduces a site-evaluation strategy named facilitated interferometric reflectometry evaluation (FIRE), which utilizes two constructed indices-normalized available observation time and normalized sampling deficiency-to assess the suitability of GNSS sites for sea-level retrieval. Implemented in Hong Kong, China, the strategy was applied to all 19 sites within the local reference GNSS network. In addition to the two sites previously used, we identified five additional sites conducive to tidal GNSS-IR, demonstrating precisions between 0.07 m and 0.37 m and correlations ranging from 0.986 to 0.711. With denser GNSS-IR observations, we were able to map sea-level variations during three historic typhoon storm surges in the region more precisely: 2017 Typhoon Hato, 2018 Typhoon Mangkhut, and 2023 Typhoon Saola. Typhoon Saola presented a longer duration of six days and a slightly lower sea-level peak between 2.88 m and 3.13 m. The deployment of additional tidal GNSS-IR sites revealed variations in sea levels during typhoon storm surges, with differences influenced by coastline topography of up to 1.24 m observed during Typhoon Mangkhut. These sites offer a valuable supplement to traditional tide measurements, filling gaps in historical records. The FIRE strategy demonstrates the untapped potential of existing GNSS networks globally for sea-level monitoring and can be employed to unlock further observational opportunities.

AB  - Practical gaps in knowledge of fence ecology or its specific requirements still exist despite numerous recommendations scattered throughout various articles. We recently carried out two different studies on fences in a French context whose results corroborate this observation, and highlight the need to synthetise and prioritise scientific and technical research. The first study was an exploratory research project on escape devices used to allow ungulates to exit fenced transport infrastructure right-of-way. The second study entailed drafting a guide on the mitigation of the fence's ecological impacts, using solar energy plants as a case study. Both were based on different types of information gathering, ranging from bibliographical research to interviews with governments officials, operating companies, engineering offices, naturalists and hunters' associations.Based on the similarities between these two studies, the urgency of certain needs, and the clear potential for these approaches to extend beyond France's borders, we have identified two key categories for future actions. The first category is a series of six research priorities: Diversifying monitoring of exclusion fencing; Developing practice-oriented fence mapping tools; Further studying the impact of fencing on animal vehicle collisions; Considering animal behaviour in monitoring protocol; Ex-situ testing of devices' effectiveness; and Studying large-scale effects of fencing. The second category comprises six method recommendations: Accurately documenting fences; Early planning of scientific monitoring; Contextualising fencing requirements; Defining effectiveness goals and criteria; Taking advantage of opportunistic Animal-Fence Event observations; and Developing artificial intelligence and computer vision to map fences. All these items are supported by examples drawn from one study or the other.Our conclusions indicate that, in the context of major expansion of fences, such recommendations must be integrated at all stages of development work. If this is not implemented, the free movement of animal species will not be adequately protected and the erosion of biodiversity will be further exacerbated.

AB  - The severity of parasitic infections can mediate the differential expression of signals among populations, creating variation in signal intensity. Male signals (patch size and brightness) were quantified in Florida scrub lizards (Sceloporus woodi) from populations that vary in ectoparasite load. Males without mites were caught before breeding and exhibited different correlations among body size, patch size, and brightness. Males with ectoparasites (range = 1-368) were captured throughout the breeding season and showed a habitat-dependent pattern of how ectoparasite load, body size, and body condition were correlated with badge characteristics. In the sand pine scrub habitat, large males in good condition that were heavily parasitized had the largest badges. There was no relationship between body size or ectoparasite load and badge darkness. Lizards from longleaf pine habitat shared only one pattern, i.e. larger males had larger badges, yet there were several key differences. Body condition and ectoparasite load were unrelated to badge size, and the most heavily parasitized males had the brightest, not darkest, badges. Instead, males with moderate and low parasite loads had the darkest abdomens, and those with low parasite loads had the darkest throats. Thus, parasite load and body condition have habitat-dependent effects on badge characteristics.

AB  - Marine reserves can increase the abundance and size of harvested fish species, but the indirect effects of protection on wider fish assemblages are less well understood. Better understanding how marine reserves indirectly effect reef fish is essential to interpreting changes in non-targeted taxa and informing management expectations as to the long-term effects of marine protection. We investigated how reef fish assemblages and habitats have changed within New Zealand's oldest marine reserve after 40 years of no-take protection (1978 to 2018), and how they differed inside and outside the reserve in 2018. Reef fish assemblages differed between 1978 and 2018, and between reserve and fished sites, and these effects were greatest at depths where habitats had changed. We report an overall increase in fish biomass in the reserve, but a long-term decline in total fish density. The increase in biomass under protection was largely driven by an increase in six target species. Eleven species exhibited longterm declines in the marine reserve; three likely a result of indirect effects related to habitat change and/or increased predation, while other declines likely reflect large-scale changes independent of reserve protection. Predicted indirect effects associated with large-scale habitat change were not apparent, except for an increase in one non-target herbivore species alongside increased kelp abundance. While further work is needed to confirm the mechanisms driving individual indirect effects, the results demonstrate that the long-term indirect effects of protection on reef fish are less common, more complex and more difficult to predict than direct effects.

AB  - Large herbivores are key regulators of open habitats across the world. Free roaming ponies have a prominent ecological role in many Atlantic landscapes, where different habitats with conservation interest are linked to ponies' occurrence. The traditional management of wild ponies, which implies minimum human intervention, is declining in Galicia, NW Spain. Changes in the management regimes include the confinement of ponies in fenced areas, the use of improved pastures (IPs) and rotation between fields. Indirect effects of these changes are expected on the ecological condition of important habitats for conservation such as dry and wet heathlands and bogs. We studied social structure, spatial ecology and habitat use in 29 mares fitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars and field observations in two areas of Galicia dominated by wet heaths and blanket bogs (Xistral), and dry heaths (Sabucedo). We used spatial location and field observations to identify each band, and calculated band size, sex ratio, home range (HR) and core areas size and overlap, and habitat use. We addressed differences and adjusted Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for these variables as functions of the type of management: free roaming vs rotation, use of IPs, fencing, and available ranging area. Larger bands were found in smaller commons, fenced and with rotation management. Home ranges, but not core area, varied as a function of the available ranging area. Bands overlap more on fenced areas with rotation management. Increasing management may concentrate grazing pressure by reducing HR and increasing bands overlapping areas, and this may have a long-term effect on habitat quality and conservation.

AB  - An understanding of individual variation in animal habitat selection is important for effective conservation and management as well as predicting species responses to a rapidly changing world. Functional responses to habitat availability can explain some of this variation, but not accounting for behavioral grouping may oversimplify inference and mask the diversity of habitat use strategies present in a population. We investigated within-home range habitat selection variation at the group level in a reintroduced population of elk (Cervus canadensis) in Kentucky, USA, during 2020-2022, analyzing satellite tracking data from 103 individuals to quantify variance in responses to seven landscape variables. We used group-level selection coefficients estimated with mixed-effects resource selection functions to model population-level functional responses and classify groups into within-season behavioral clusters. We then used cross validation to assess if these methods of generalizing group-level variation improved predictions of space use. We found that elk had highly variable responses to several covariates, and that some of this variation could be attributed to functional responses to either cover type availability or configuration. When we generalized behavioral tactics via clustering, we found significant increases in group-level predictive ability over the global model and, in some cases, the functional models. This suggests that clustered behaviors are also driving individual heterogeneity in this population. Our results highlight the importance of considering individual differences when studying wildlife-habitat relationships and underscore the need for a more complete understanding of the mechanisms behind this variation to inform habitat management and conservation efforts.

AB  - Background Karuk and Yurok tribes in northwestern California, USA, are revitalizing the practice of cultural burning, which is the use of prescribed burns to enhance culturally important species. These cultural burns are critical to the livelihoods of indigenous peoples, and were widespread prior to the establishment of fire exclusion policies. One of the major objectives of cultural burning is to enhance California hazelnut (Corylus cornuta Marsh var. californica) basketry stem production for Karuk and Yurok basketweavers. To evaluate cultural burning as a form of human ecosystem engineering, we monitored hazelnut basketry stem production, qualities, and shrub density in 48 plots (400 m(2)) within two prescribed and 19 cultural burn sites. Socio-ecological variables that were analyzed included burn frequency, burn season, overstory tree (>= 10 cm diameter at breast height) basal area, ungulate browse, and aspect. We also observed basketry stem gathering to compare travel distances, gathering rates, and basketweaver preferences across sites with different fire histories and land tenure. Results Hazelnut shrubs, one growing season post burn, produced a 13-fold increase in basketry stems compared with shrubs growing at least three seasons post burn (P < 0.0001). Basketry stem production and stem length displayed negative relationships with overstory tree basal area (P < 0.01) and ungulate browse (P < 0.0001). Plots burned at high frequency (at least three burn events from 1989 to 2019) had 1.86-fold greater hazelnut shrubs than plots experiencing less than three burn events (P < 0.0001), and were all located on the Yurok Reservation where land tenure of indigenous people is comparatively stronger. Basketweavers travelled 3.8-fold greater distance to reach gathering sites burned by wildfires compared with those that were culturally burned (P < 0.01). At cultural burn sites, wildfire sites, and fire-excluded sites, mean gathering rates were 4.9, 1.6, and 0.5 stems per minute per individual, respectively. Conclusions Karuk and Yurok cultural fire regimes with high burn frequencies (e.g., three to five years) promote high densities of hazelnut shrubs and increase hazelnut basketry stem production. This improves gathering efficiency and lowers travel costs to support the revitalization of a vital cultural practice. Our findings provide evidence of positive human ecosystem engineering, and show that increasing tribal sovereignty over fire management improves socio-economic well-being while at the same time supports measures of ecosystem structure and function.

AB  - Invasive subterranean termite species within the genus Coptotermes (Heterotermitidae) are important structural pests. However, they also cause extensive damage in live trees and pose serious risks to tree health as a result. The urban tree canopy in areas with established populations of Coptotermes are therefore at risk of loss of trees over time, and many urban forests within municipality parks in their introduced range may experience tangible canopy alteration. This can have wide-reaching negative impacts on the ecology of these parks and to the public that utilize them. This 5-yr long study utilized eight parks (1,304 trees) to demonstrate how a simple visual monitoring/bait approach can identify and eliminate termite colonies infesting trees and maintain minimal termite activity within public green spaces. Here, we demonstrate that the systematic direct application of an experimental above-ground chitin synthesis inhibitor (CSI) bait formulation to trees can eliminate termite activity and protect trees. However, owing to high termite pressure, colony reinfestation is likely over time, and municipalities may have to establish perennial programs that would include regular monitoring and treatment as needed. Such a long-term strategy would minimize tree loss, while using a termite-specific formulated pesticide with a low amount of active ingredient. This pilot study demonstrates that it can be achieved, but ultimately, the success of this approach relies on technically competent staff that can readily identify the signs of active Coptotermes infestation in trees and access to above ground CSI bait formulations.

AB  - Termites feed on vegetal matter at various stages of decomposition. Lineages of wood- and soil-feeding termites are distributed across terrestrial ecosystems located between 45 degrees N and 45 degrees S of latitude, a distribution they acquired through many transoceanic dispersal events. While wood-feeding termites often live in the wood on which they feed and are efficient at dispersing across oceans by rafting, soil-feeders are believed to be poor dispersers. Therefore, their distribution across multiple continents requires an explanation. Here, we reconstructed the historical biogeography and the ancestral diet of termites using mitochondrial genomes and delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotope measurements obtained from 324 termite samples collected in five biogeographic realms. Our biogeographic models showed that wood-feeders are better at dispersing across oceans than soil-feeders, further corroborated by the presence of wood-feeders on remote islands devoid of soil-feeders. However, our ancestral range reconstructions identified 33 dispersal events among biogeographic realms, 18 of which were performed by soil-feeders. Therefore, despite their lower dispersal ability, soil-feeders performed several transoceanic dispersals that shaped the distribution of modern termites.

AB  - Single-tree selection (STS) silviculture has dominated management of northern hardwood forests (NHFs) in the Great Lakes region since introduction the 1960's. Periodic partial cuttings are assumed to promote and recruit well-stocked natural regeneration, resulting in balanced uneven-aged stand structure with sustainable harvest volumes. However, low sapling density of tree species desirable for management, including typically dominant and economically valuable sugar maple (Acer saccharum), suggests STS may not be effectively recruiting sugar maple in some regions. Few studies have analyzed sugar maple size-age structure to determine whether recruitment failure has been chronic since partial cutting began or is a more recent phenomenon. Here, we analyzed sugar maple age structure, regional patterns, and possible drivers for 51 selection-managed NHF stands located in northern Michigan, USA. Our data were 1499 aged basal discs collected from stumps of sugar maple trees >5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) harvested winter 2017-2018. Our results offer little evidence to suggest that partial cuttings have promoted well-stocked ingrowth of sugar maple saplings. For most stands, age and diameter were non-linearly related, with a wide range of larger-diameter trees having similar ages. Among stands, sugar maple sawtimber (>24 cm DBH) averaged 106 years old and poletimber (11.4-24 cm DBH) 91 years, along with older than expected saplings (5-11.4 cm DBH) averaging 67 years. Most stands were dominated by a similar to 100-year-old upper canopy cohort, with a majority having <= 2 younger cohorts typically of low density and >50 years old. Areas with greater snow water equivalent and lower January minimum temperatures, where deer populations have been historically low, generally have younger sugar maple saplings. Low density and generally old age of smaller size classes led to much lower stocking of age classes <70 years old than expected under STS. Together, this suggests long-term STS management for sugar maple may be unsustainable over large portions of the study region if current trends in forest and deer management continue. Our age structure analysis supports the growing consensus that alternative management may be needed for NHF in parts of the Great Lakes region.

AB  - Humans may have settled the Faroe Islands and begun using the land for livestock grazing as early as 500 CE, around 300 years earlier than previously believed, according to sedimentary DNA and molecular fecal biomarkers from a lake sediment core.
   The Faroe Islands, a North Atlantic archipelago between Norway and Iceland, were settled by Viking explorers in the mid-9th century CE. However, several indirect lines of evidence suggest earlier occupation of the Faroes by people from the British Isles. Here, we present sedimentary ancient DNA and molecular fecal biomarker evidence from a lake sediment core proximal to a prominent archaeological site in the Faroe Islands to establish the earliest date for the arrival of people in the watershed. Our results reveal an increase in fecal biomarker concentrations and the first appearance of sheep DNA at 500 CE (95% confidence interval 370-610 CE), pre-dating Norse settlements by 300 years. Sedimentary plant DNA indicates an increase in grasses and the disappearance of woody plants, likely due to livestock grazing. This provides unequivocal evidence for human arrival and livestock disturbance in the Faroe Islands centuries before Viking settlement in the 9th century.

AB  - Many plants are defended from herbivory by costly insect mutualists. Understanding positive associations between plants and mutualists requires a whole-plant perspective including roots. We hypothesized that root surface area increases with mutualist activity (to a saturation threshold) and recent rainfall but that this relationship shifts when herbivores are excluded. We also hypothesized that invasive ants limit root surface area and that mutualism breakdown driven by invaders blunts root responses to rainfall and herbivore exclusion. Using minirhizotrons (est. 2021), we surveyed root surface area of ant-acacias during a dry (2022) and then a wet (2023) season. Study plots either excluded or permitted vertebrate browsers, within a natural experiment comparing mutualist-defended ant-acacias to those invaded by a mutualism-disrupting ant. Root area increased with mutualist activity to a threshold, but this positive association was less apparent during rainy periods. Megabrowser exclusion increased overall root area but reduced the threshold for a positive association with mutualist activity and reduced the steepness of the root area-rainfall correlation. Ant-invaded acacias had smaller root areas that correlated less steeply with rainfall. Positive associations between insect defense and root area were thus contingent on rainfall, herbivory, and biotic invasion, drivers that are shifting under global change.

AB  - Many bird species use features of the physical environment to cue breeding activity. We show that for 2 species of Pacific auks (zooplanktivorous Cassin's auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus and generalist rhinoceros auklet Cerorhinca monocerata), spatio-temporal variation in marine production indicators surrounding a major breeding colony in the northeast Pacific Ocean can cue laying date. By utilizing a multi-year phenological time series and a spatio-temporal sliding-window analysis spanning November up until median lay dates in spring, chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations in the surface ocean around the colony strongly predicted lay date. However, the response to this cue differed between species by over 2 mo, as each species was exposed to different, sequential water-masses. We show that for Cassin's auklets, chl a levels at Triangle Island, British Columbia (Canada) in February, nearly 2 mo prior to actual laying, strongly correlated with lay date in April (average r = 0.83). At this time, the ocean environment around Triangle Island is dominated by water-masses from the south-southeast. However, for sympatric rhinoceros auklets, chl a along broad shelf-break areas in April prior to lay dates in May strongly correlated with lay date (average r = 0.76). Occurring after the spring transition, these water-masses flow primarily from the northwest. Consistent with other bird species, both auks appear to respond to information about food production, but at different spatio-temporal scales. We suggest that these different responses to environmental cues reflect species-specific differences in female migration behaviour, and an attempt by Cassin's auklets to bet-hedge against phenological mismatches.

   Pastoral management in Europe is an important element in protecting biodiversity and the landscape. Shepherding stimulates the development of the market of traditional and regional products, handicrafts and services. Pastoral farming in Europe is an important element of biodiversity and landscape protection. Shepherding stimulates the development of the market for traditional, regional products, handicrafts and services. For many years, wool was an important product obtained in mountain areas from local sheep breeds, now treated as a waste product. The aim of the study is to describe farming methods in mountain areas, indicating innovative possibilities of using sheep wool.
   Material and methods
   The material consisted of literature studies and own research on management in mountain areas. Own research and literature analyzes have shown that, due to its properties, wool obtained from mountain sheep can be used as a natural fiber in a biodegradable composite and constitute an alternative to plastic packaging. The introduction of natural fibers in the fertilizer composite can improve not only soil fertility but also bring economic effects, such as the use of wool of Polish mountain sheep as part of the circular economy.
   Results and conclusions
   Summarize, the search for alternative directions for the use of sheep wool is of strategic importance for maintaining and even increasing the sheep population in Poland and in other European Union countries. Occurring soil droughts in the summer period affect the reduction of plant yields, and for this reason, the application of biodegradable biocomposite to the soil will not have a negative impact on the environment of mountain pastures and meadows

AB  - Operating as ecological engineers, the increased distribution and abundance of wild hogs (Sus scrofa) has caused considerable socio-economic impacts. The international scope of economic research providing wild hog damage estimates are often confined to agricultural crops, while damage estimates among forest plantations are lacking. In Alabama, private landowners hold the majority of timberland acreage and are less equipped to absorb financial losses from wild hog damage than their industrial counterparts. A survey was conducted to estimate the economic impact of wild hogs, namely costs of damage and control, to privately owned forestlands. The survey was distributed in the summer of 2016 to a sample of 1160 private landowners across the State. A 35% response rate was achieved from the sampled group. Survey results indicated in 2013 to 2015 longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) were the only species damaged by wild hogs. Wild hogs caused damage to 34 and 13% of forest acres in longleaf and loblolly plantations, respectively. At $50.40 per acre, costs associated with replanting damaged longleaf acres were double those for loblolly. Survey results suggest the southern half of Alabama holds the largest wild hog populations and sustained the most damage to forest stands. Consequently, landowners in this region invested the most capital on control methods where the average cost per control technique ranged from $12-2750. Additionally, landowners who did not have wild hogs on their property were willing to pay around $14 per acre more for eradication than those with. We hope the findings from this survey will provide a better understanding of the economic impact of wild hogs in young forest plantations.

AB  - Haleakala National Park and montane areas on east Maui, Hawaiian Archipelago, support critical nesting habitat for endangered 'ua'u Hawaiian petrel Pterodroma sandwichensis. Habitat loss, non-native predators, and damage by feral ungulates are limiting factors for ground-nesting petrels at Haleakala and throughout Hawai'i. Because nesting habitats differ among the Hawaiian Islands, habitat distribution modeling for Hawaiian petrel has been island specific. Based on 2453 known nest site locations, we provide the first landscape-scale predictive model describing relative abundance and habitat available for nesting petrels throughout upper Haleakala (1830 to 3055 m). We evaluated (principal components analyses and Pearson's correlation) 13 spatial landscape and climate predictor variables associated with nest sites and the background landscape followed by random forest modeling to predict nest site density. Six variables (elevation, slope, topographic position index at 2 scales, heat load index, presence-absence ash/cinder, and presence-absence vegetation) indicated nest sites occurred non-randomly throughout the central part of the summit and crater; greatest concentrations were predicted along the crater rim and a ridgeline extending southwest from the summit. Moderately high predicted density occurred in the northeastern and northern crater. Lower elevations to the north, west, and south flanks of Haleakala had relatively fewer predicted nest sites. Although we focused on higher elevations on Haleakala, there is no reason to suspect that conservation efforts would not be successful at lower elevations, provided nesting petrels were protected from invasive predators, grazing ungulates, and significant land alteration.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that an increase in the population size of sika deer (Cervus nippon) decreases the abundance of rodents but increases that of several invertebrates (Scarabaeidae, Rhaphidophoridae, and earthworms) outside a deep-proof fence in Oku-Nikko, Japan. Therefore, the diet of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) feeding on these animals is expected to vary according to changes in prey abundance. As red foxes also scavenge deer carcasses, an increase in the number of deer is expected to lead to changes in the red fox diet. In this study, the diet and sightings of red foxes inside and outside the fence were compared. Generalized linear mixed models indicate that the sika deer remains, ground-dwelling insects (Scarabaeidae and Rhaphidophoridae as a group, and Carabidae), and earthworms increased in the fox diet outside the fence, while the ingestion of voles decreased. The difference in prey consumption by red foxes was probably caused by differences in prey availability inside and outside the fence or the presence of available alternative food. These results suggest that red foxes demonstrate dietary plasticity in areas where habitat structure has been substantially modified by deer grazing. Although the abundance of voles, the primary food of red foxes, decreased outside the fence, the sighting rates of red foxes obtained by spotlight count were not significantly different between inside and outside the fence, suggesting that the presence of the others increased or available alternative food may have compensated for the negative effects of decreasing vole abundance.

AB  - Human activities and climate change threaten seabirds globally, and many species are declining from already small breeding populations. Monitoring of breeding colonies can identify population trends and important conservation concerns, but it is a persistent challenge to achieve adequate coverage of remote and sensitive breeding sites. Southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) exemplify this challenge: as polar, pelagic marine predators they are subject to a variety of anthropogenic threats, but they often breed in remote colonies that are highly sensitive to disturbance. Aerial remote sensing can overcome some of these difficulties to census breeding sites and explore how local environmental factors influence important characteristics such as nest-site selection and chick survival. To this end, we used drone photography to map giant petrel nests, repeatedly evaluate chick survival and quantify-associated physical and biological characteristics of the landscape at two neighboring breeding sites on Humble Island and Elephant Rocks, along the western Antarctic Peninsula in January-March 2020. Nest sites occurred in areas with relatively high elevations, gentle slopes, and high wind exposure, and statistical models predicted suitable nest-site locations based on local spatial characteristics, explaining 72.8% of deviance at these sites. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of drones as a tool to identify, map, and monitor seabird nests, and to quantify important habitat associations that may constitute species preferences or sensitivities. These may, in turn, contextualize some of the diverse population trajectories observed for this species throughout the changing Antarctic environment.

AB  - The evidential value of an mtDNA match between biological remains and their potential donor is determined by the random match probability of the haplotype. This probability is based on the haplotype's population frequency estimate. Consequently, implementing a population study representative of the population relevant to a forensic case is vital to correctly evaluating the evidence. The emerging number of poaching cases and the limited availability of such data emphasizes the need for an improved fallow deer mtDNA population databank for forensic purposes, including targeting the entire mitochondrial control region. By sequencing a 945-base-pair-long segment of the mitochondrial control region in 138 animals from five populations in Hungary, we found four different haplotypes, including one which had not yet been described. Our results, supplemented with data already available from previous research, do not support the possibility of determining the population of origin, although some patterns of geographical separation can be distinguished. Estimates of molecular diversity indicate similarly low mtDNA diversity (Hd = 0.565 and pi = 0.002) compared to data from other countries. The calculated random match probability of 0.547 shows a high probability of coincidence and, therefore, a limited capacity for exclusion. Our results indicate that despite the overall low genetic diversity of mtDNA within the Hungarian fallow deer samples, a pattern of differentiation among the regions is present, which can have relevance from a forensic point of view.

AB  - Improved climate-resilient strains of indigenous sheep and goats were introduced in the Nyando basin of western Kenya in 2013. This study evaluated the performance of the breeds five years after their first introduction, and their contribution to household revenues. Red Maasai and Red Maasai x Dorper sheep and Galla goats introduced in Nyando adapted to the environment and retained performance levels exhibited in their original environments. They have been widely adopted by the farmers and are used for upgrading local breeds through crossbreeding, yielding offspring that are 50% heavier than local breeds at one year of age. Costs for producing the small ruminants tend to increase with land size owned, mainly due to higher costs for managing the health of more livestock. The costs of producing goats are significantly higher than for sheep. Revenues accrued from goat milk contribute to 10% of the revenue from goats. The introduced breeds provided a significant productivity lift in the local livestock population, resulting in higher returns to the smallholder farmers. For long-term sustainability of the productivity gains, a community-based selective mating program using reference sire flocks with an overall goal of good growth, adaptability, and milk production should be adopted.

AB  - African forest hogs (genus Hylochoerus) are extant Afro-tropical suids that inhabit a variety of forest environments and thick bushlands and are predominantly herbivores. Hylochoerus likely evolved from a Pleistocene Kolpochoerus majus-like ancestor, but its recent evolutionary history is virtually unknown. Here, we describe a partial right lower third molar from the Late Pleistocene Wasiriya Beds of Rusinga Island (similar to 50-36 ka). The crowns are mesiodistally compressed in a bunolophodont fashion and arranged in columnar pillars that resemble those of extant Hylochoerus. We provide accurate data derived from computed tomography on the hypsodonty index (HI) of extant Hylochoerus and show that the Rusinga third molar crown was as tall as those of its modern counterpart (HI = 1.8-2.0). Stable carbon isotope analyses suggest that the diet of the Rusinga specimen (delta C-13 = -17.0 parts per thousand) was also like that of extant forest hogs (delta C-13 average = -17.6 parts per thousand). This extremely negative value contrasts strikingly with those of other fossil large herbivores at Rusinga (delta C-13 average = -0.7 parts per thousand.). Among the potential explanations for this anomaly, the most likely is that the Late Pleistocene paleoenvironments were more heterogeneous than previously considered and may have included closed-canopy woodland in the highlands of Rusinga.

AB  - Aujeszky's disease, also known as pseudorabies is an acute infectious viral disease in a variety of mammals caused by Suid herpesvirus 1, a member of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae and the family Herpesviridae. This virus causes significant economic losses in agriculture of numerous countries. In particular, in pig farming, the main losses are currently associated with restrictions of international trade, as well as the cost of vaccination or slaughter of infected animals. The main reservoirs species of this disease are considered to be wild boars and domestic pigs. So, in this article the authors performed a comparative retrospective analysis of the prevalence of Aujeszky's disease among these species in Ukraine over 2009-2020 by systematizing and analyzing the epizootic data and results of serological studies. As a result of the conducted research, there is a clear trend that shows the reduction in the number of locations in Ukraine (farms, households, etc.) with domestic pigs affected by Aujeszky's disease. Thus, in 2009 four such farms were found, and in 2018 -only one. During 2014-2016 and 2019-2020, affected farms and locations were not registered for this disease. In total, 21 such points with infected pigs were registered during the analyzed period. As for wild boars, during the analyzed 12 years, locations with animals affected by Aujeszky's disease were registered only in 2013 and 2014 (two and one, respectively). It should be noted that all of those with infected wild boars were found in the AR Crimea. For the twelve years, the number of tested sera samples from domestic pigs amounted to 378,678 (7.4% were positive) and from wild boars -9,052 (19.8% were positive). As a result of comparative geographical analysis of the obtained data on the detection of specific humoral antibodies to the Aujeszky's disease virus among both species for 12 years in the regions of Ukraine, there is no established clear correlation between the spread of the disease among wild boars and domestic pigs. Thus, the highest seroprevalence rates among wild boars were observed in the northern and northeastern parts of Ukraine, and in domestic pigs, on the contrary, in the southern and central parts of this country. It should be noted, that since 2014 the number of serological tests among both species for carriers of Aujeszky's disease has significantly decreased.

AB  - Introduction: The Costa Rican southwestern region is considered one of the neotropical biodiversity hotspots. This geographically isolated forest embraces a rich diversity of moths and butterflies, which is still unknown for the most part. Objectives: (a) Describe and compare the diversity of moths and butterflies among different localities of the southwestern Costa Rican region, and (b) identify information gaps in this group of insects. Methods: Data for this study were collected in 12 different localities by parataxonomists and taxonomists for the national inventory of biodiversity led by INBio (National Biodiversity Institute) using different trap types, but relying mainly on light traps. We compared alpha and beta diversity of moths and butterflies among the six localities (Cort & eacute;s, Piedras Blancas, Rancho Quemado, Agujas, Los Patos, Sirena) with more extensive sampling. Results: The dataset consisted of 78 747 specimens, of which 2 096 were identified only to the order level. The remaining 76 650 specimens were classified to the family level (n = 48 families), genus, species, or morphospecies. Species and morphospecies were distributed across 37 families. The alpha and beta diversity varied across localities for the 12 families of moths and butterflies that were present in the six localities selected. In general, Piedras Blancas, Rancho Quemado, and Sirena stand out as the most diverse localities. The richness of species varied among different families. For most families Agujas, Los Patos, and Sirena contained more species, but some other families showed a different pattern. Conclusion: Differences in the diversity of moths and butterflies over a northern-southern gradient likely correspond to species (individuals within species) adapted to different biotic (e.g., availability of host plants and food resources) and abiotic (e.g., microclimatic conditions associated to the complex topography of the region) conditions. Despite the large effort made by INBio in knowing and mapping the biodiversity of Costa Rica, and the economic and biological importance of the biodiversity, there are still a huge number of species to be known, named, and properly used.

AB  - Wolves are assumed to be ungulate obligates, however, a recently described pack on Pleasant Island, Alaska USA, is persisting on sea otters and other marine resources without ungulate prey, violating this long-held assumption. We address questions about these wolves regarding their origin and fate, degree of isolation, risk of inbreeding depression, and diet specialization by individual and sex. We applied DNA metabarcoding and genotyping by amplicon sequencing using 957 scats collected from 2016 to 2022, and reduced representation sequencing of tissue samples to establish a detailed understanding of Pleasant Island wolf ecology and compare them with adjacent mainland wolves. Dietary overlap was higher among individual wolves on Pleasant Island (Pianka's index mean 0.95 +/- 0.03) compared to mainland wolves (0.70 +/- 0.21). The individual diets of island wolves were dominated by sea otter, ranging from 40.6% to 63.2% weighted percent of occurrence (wPOO) (mean 55.5 +/- 8.7). In contrast, individual mainland wolves primarily fed on ungulates (42.2 +/- 21.3) or voles during a population outbreak (31.2 +/- 23.2). We traced the origin of the Pleasant Island pack to a mainland pair that colonized around 2013 and produced several litters. After this breeding pair was killed, their female offspring and an immigrant male became the new breeders in 2019. We detected 20 individuals of which 8 (40%) were trapped and killed while two died of natural causes during the 6-year study. Except for the new breeding male, the pedigree analysis and genotype results showed no additional movement to or from the island, indicating limited dispersal but no evidence of inbreeding. Our findings suggest wolves exhibit more flexible foraging behavior than previously believed, and hunting strategies can substantially differ between individuals within or between packs. Nevertheless, anthropogenic and natural mortality combined with limited connectivity to the mainland may inhibit the continued persistence of Pleasant Island wolves.
   We applied DNA metabarcoding and SNP genotyping to quantify variation in marine foraging behavior within wolf packs, among sexes, and individuals using 957 scats collected from an island and the adjacent mainland from 2016 to 2022. Island wolves consistently consumed sea otters while mainland wolves fed mainly on ungulates and voles with more variation annually, among sexes and individuals, indicating both individual variation in the diet of a cooperatively hunting predator and varying hunting strategies among individuals within the same pack. We also found limited dispersal to and from the island with only one unrelated wolf coming from the mainland during the 6-year study period. Our findings suggest wolves are more flexible in their foraging strategies than is commonly appreciated and that the recolonization of sea otters can allow wolves to persist on predominantly non-ungulate, marine resources. Nevertheless, anthropogenic and natural mortality, and a lack of movement to and from the island may inhibit the continued persistence of the Pleasant Island wolves.image

AB  - Studies have reported goat Polled Intersex Syndrome(PIS) a 11.7-kb deletion triggers intersexuality and polledness in goats. To determine the effect of PIS region on horned phenotype of Guanzhong dairy goats, four specific primers (PIS1-1, PIS1-2, PIS2 and PIS3) covering PIS fragment were designed, and four DNA fragment were amplifed and sequenced. A 12.814kb sequence was assembled containing the whole goat PIS region both in horned goats and in polled goats, which mean there were no 11.7 kb deletion in the Guanzhong dairy goats. The polymorphisms sites in PIS region of horned and polled Guanzhong dairy goats were identified, and a total of 30 polymorphisms sites were confirmed (A648T, T652C, G1107C, T2594C, G2820A, G3556A, A3573G, T3621C, A5329T, T5392G, G5878A, C5996T, A6187G, C6228A, G6969T, G7045T, T7057C, C7266G, C7417T, T8327G, T9029G, C10034A, A10846G, del 10861-10862TT, G11842A, G12157A, G12104A, del 12431-12432AT, G12665A and del 12771-12772TT) in the 12.814 kb sequence. The further annotation results showed that a tRNA was located at 4218-4290bp, STR1 (TGTGTGTGTGTG) and STR2 (ATATATATATAT) were located at 9473-9484bp and 12451-12462bp, respectively. Three micro RNAs, dme-mir-1, dme-mir-263a and cbr-mir-354 were confermed to locate at 3002-3023bp, 9078-9094bp and 10866-10882bp, respectively. There is a CpG island at 4390-4540 bp. Our results showed that the PIS regions have no effect on polled phenotype of Guanzhong dairy goat, genetic diversity in PIS region of the goat were identified and the key gene polymorphism sites still waiting to be determined.

AB  - Context Gaining insights into seasonal aggregations of marine megafauna and how patterns vary among demographic groups is pivotal for evaluating anthropogenic risk exposure and modeling populations and ecosystem dynamics. In California, adult and subadult white sharks recurrently aggregate on the coast near pinniped colonies in fall and winter months, facilitating comprehensive long-term field studies.Aims In this study, we used over 15 years of passive acoustic telemetry data to compare the seasonal dynamics of coastal habitat use for white sharks tagged in central California among four demographic groups (adult females, adult males, subadult females, and subadult males).Methods Acoustic tags were deployed on 355 white sharks at coastal aggregation sites and monitored across a coastal array of underwater receivers from 2006 to 2022. The main aggregation sites of the Northeast Pacific (A & ntilde;o Nuevo, the Farallon Islands and Tomales) were continuously monitored, with an expansion of the acoustic network to the south in the latter years of the study.Key results White sharks were tracked for an average duration of 594 +/- 552 days (mean +/- s.d.), with total track durations ranging up to 3235 days. Notably, adult male sharks exhibited the highest residency to central California coastal aggregation sites and demonstrated earlier seasonal peak densities in late October. Adult female presence peaked in early December. Adult sharks displayed distinct seasonal gaps in detection where they have been shown with satellite tags to migrate offshore, with females displaying much longer average detection gaps than for males (averaging 1.5 years vs 0.7 years). In contrast, subadults exhibited higher coastal affinity with more consistent and widespread detections across a higher number of coastal sites throughout the year, often extending beyond the main aggregation areas outside of the peak aggregation season.Conclusions We hypothesize that the observed differences between demographic groups are attributed to sex- and size-specific foraging and reproductive strategies. The extended receiver network also showed expansive coastal movements and identified potential undescribed aggregation sites.Implications Insights from our extensive acoustic dataset represent a significant advancement in assessing the timing of anthropogenic interactions and modeling both ecosystem and population dynamics.

AB  - Human-elephant conflict (HEC) is a serious social-ecological problem in Sri Lanka's elephant range regions, as between 200 and 400 elephants have been killed annually over the last years, and more than 1200 people have died from the consequences of elephant encounters within a decade. Crop foraging causes economic damage to farming households. The study aims to understand factors driving vulnerability to HEC among the population. Employing a cross-communal multi-item large-N field survey (N = 651), authors were able to describe living conditions and perceptions of Sri Lankan villagers affected by HEC. By running a multiple regression analysis with correlated variables, the study is able to correlate independent variables to vulnerability, namely socio-economic conditions, environmental change and land-use, and awareness. Furthermore, a vulnerability map has been created, identifying Puttalam, Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, Matale, and Polonnaruwa districts as conflict hotspots. Private electric fences as a widespread protection measure were found to have unintended negative side-effects to non-protected households. The findings suggest the urgent need to upscale public policies mitigating the consequences of HEC on affected populations by reducing overall vulnerability to environmental hazards, including human-wildlife conflict.

AB  - Lipid biomarker analysis focused on steroids has shown to have great potential for discriminating between animal faecal inputs in archaeology. This is particularly interesting when applied to stabling deposits to assess herding strategies and livestock composition. Here we present the results of a sedimentary faecal biomarker study conducted at Belmaco Cave, a pre-European archaeological site in La Palma (Canary Islands). The site was occupied by indigenous pastoralist groups over the course of five centuries prior to the first arrival of the Europeans in the 15th century. Previous soil micromorphological data indicates recurrent sheep and/or goat penning and periodic burning of the pen in the central area of the cave. We selected bulk sediment samples from unburned, charred and ashed dung layers and carried out sterol, stanol and bile acid analysis. Our results suggest that the main source of faecal matter is sheep. We also found that even though charred and dung ash layers contained lower concentrations of the biomarker compounds, these were still sufficient to provide information on the origin of the faecal remains. These data add to our current knowledge of the aboriginal Canary Island pastoralist economy.

AB  - Introduction and Objective. Lyme borreliosis (LB) causes hundreds of thousands of new human infections worldwide annually. This is the first study connecting the LB risk to children with environmental factors. Materials and Method. The potential impacts were assessed of environmental factors (deer density in forests, coverage of potential broadleaved forest plant communities, urbanization index) on the number of LB cases in children. Analysis covered the medical records of 196 children diagnosed with LB (ICD- A69.2) from 1 January 2012 - 30 October 2021 in Wielkopolska Province (Poland). Results. All examined factors were positively correlated with LB cases. The highest correlation with the number of patients diagnosed with LB was presented by the degree of urbanization (percentage of the population living in cities in the total inhabitants of the study region). The number of cases was much higher in the second research period (2017-2021). Conclusions. The number of LB cases in children is increasing as the coverage of potential broadleaved forest plant communities increases. The number of cases among males is positively correlated with the coverage. Deer density is positively correlated with the number of LB cases among children - the higher the deer density, the greater the risk of LB infection. LB cases in children are positively correlated with the urbanization index - the more people that live in cities, the the risk to children of LB infection.

AB  - Herbivorous fishes play an important role in preventing the overabundance of macroalgae on coral reefs. Understanding the feeding selectivity and consumption of macroalgae by herbivorous fishes can be challenging in studies of their ecological role in the preservation and recovery of coral reefs. Coral reef decline, macroalgal overgrowth and overfishing are clearly visible in the Xisha Islands, China. However, there are seldom studies on the feeding behaviors of herbivorous fishes in this area. We used microscopy, 18S rRNA high-throughput sequencing, and stable isotope analyses to comprehensively examine the diet of eight herbivorous reef fish species common in the Xisha Islands, including one parrotfish, two chub, two unicorn fish, and three rabbitfish. Based on microscopic examination, Siganus argenteus fed on the highest number of macroalgae species (five species), followed by Naso unicornis (four species). Kyphosus cinerascens, K. vaigiensis, N. unicornis and S. punctatissimus fed on the entire macroalgal thallus, indicating their greater ecological importance compared with species that only consume algal fronds. According to the 18S rRNA high-throughput sequencing of fish intestinal contents, cluster analysis revealed that consumed macroalgae composition from the eight fishes always grouped together based on the fish species, but with low similarity. K. vaigiensis removed the highest diversity of macroalgae species as well as the greatest quantity of macroalgae. Calotomus carolinus can consume the red alga Pneophyllum conicum, which is widely distributed on Indo-Pacific coral reefs and can overgrow and kill live corals. N. unicornis was found to occupy the lowest trophic position based on stable isotope analysis. Multi-technique analyses revealed that K. vaigiensis, N. unicornis and S. argenteus showed a high consumption potential of macroalgae, suggesting that they are the key browsers that should receive priority protection in the Xisha Islands. A diverse herbivorous fish fauna is also very important in the Xisha coral reefs. These results not only demonstrated the various functions of different herbivorous fish species in macroalgal removal, but also provided insights into the management of herbivorous fishes on the coral reefs of the South China Sea.

AB  - The status of pinnipeds on mid-Atlantic ridge islands is reviewed to detect trends that may relate to climate change. Small numbers of southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina breed on Gough Island (40 degrees S, 10 degrees W) and at Bouvetoya (54 degrees 24 ' S, 03 degrees 21 ' E) where numbers remained small over similar to 68 years. Vagrant southern elephant seals wandered farther north to tropical Saint Helena Island (15 degrees 57 ' S, 5 degrees 41 ' W) in historical times but have not been recorded there more recently. This suggests a contraction of their distributional range, as manifested in the decline in numbers to imminent extinction at Gough Island. At Gough Island and at Tristan da Cunha (37 degrees 05 ' S, 12 degrees 17 ' W), leopard seals Hydrurga leptonyx and Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella are occasional seasonal transients from Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands and the circumpolar sea ice farther to the south. Large populations of Antarctic fur seals A. gazella and sub-Antarctic fur seals A. tropicalis breed at Bouvetoya and Gough Island, respectively. The current state of both populations is uncertain as other populations of conspecifics in the South Atlantic and South Indian oceans are in decline ostensibly contingent upon reduced food availability, likely precipitated by climate change.

AB  - The Aldabra giant tortoise is the only surviving lineage of the Malagasy megafauna, which went extinct due to human activities over the last millennium. In 2018, the first rewilding project was launched at the Anjajavy Reserve (NW Madagascar), using 12 founders of unknown origin. They started to mate in 2019, but genetic proximity between individuals and their reproductive output remains to be determined for optimal management of the newly established population. Here, we used 29 microsatellite loci to analyze the genetic diversity of native populations from Aldabra, a coral atoll 420 km from Madagascar, to assign Anjajavy founders to specific genetic groups and assess how well they represent the overall genetic diversity in the native range. Additionally, five of these loci allowed us to investigate the diversity of the genomic region containing the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes. The non-MHC microsatellite data were also used to investigate the past demography of the species using a stepwise mutation model (VarEff). Finally, we evaluated the contribution of Anjajavy founders to the offspring. First, the clustering analysis identified two main genetic groups in Aldabra, and demographic inferences then support that population size fluctuations were strongly shaped by climatic shifts and sea-level changes on the atoll. Both genetic groups are represented among the Anjajavy founders, who most likely originated from the southern island of Aldabra. However, the founders contributed unequally to the offspring, as most juveniles analyzed were the result of mating between individuals from the two groups, leading to a significant global increase in heterozygosity in the offspring. We propose measures to minimize inbreeding and maintain genetic diversity within the Anjajavy population, thereby enhancing its potential for long-term viability.

AB  - Background: Data on the movement behavior of translocated wild pigs is needed to develop appropriate response strategies for containing and eliminating new source populations following translocation events. We conducted experimental trials to compare the home range establishment and space-use metrics, including the number of days and distance traveled before becoming range residents, for wild pigs translocated with their social group and individually.
   Results: We found wild pigs translocated with their social group made less extensive movements away from the release location and established a stable home range similar to 5 days faster than those translocated individually. We also examined how habitat quality impacted the home range sizes of translocated wild pigs and found wild pigs maintained larger ranges in areas with higher proportion of low-quality habitat.
   Conclusion: Collectively, our findings suggest translocations of invasive wild pigs have a greater probability of establishing a viable population near the release site when habitat quality is high and when released with members of their social unit compared to individuals moved independent of their social group or to low-quality habitat. However, all wild pigs translocated in our study made extensive movements from their release location, highlighting the potential for single translocation events of either individuals or groups to have far-reaching consequences within a much broader landscape beyond the location where they are released. These results highlight the challenges associated with containing populations in areas where illegal introduction of wild pigs occurs, and the need for rapid response once releases are identified.

AB  - Habitat management is an important approach suppressing pest via conservation biological control in agricul-tural systems. Intercropping flowering plants is a well-practiced habitat management measure, supporting predators with shelter, nectar, alternative prey and pollen. However, few studies systematically revealed pred-ator's conservation performance, transfer process and biocontrol ability by intercropping flowering plants in apple orchards. Here, an experimental model of intercropping flowering plants in apple orchard was planned for two consecutive years to response above questions. Four flowering plants conserve a different number and proportions of six main predator species (three ladybeetles (Propylaea japonica, Harmonia axyridis and Hippo-damia variegata), one lacewing (Chrysoperla sinica), one hoverfly (Episyrphus balteatus) and one spider (Mis-umenops tricuspidatus)). By rubidium (Rb) marking technique, transfer rate of predators C. sinica from flowering plant Cnidium monnieri to apple trees were 79.5 % and 84.1 % in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Transfer rate of predators H. axyridis from flowering plant C. monnieri to apple trees were 74.2 % and 80.1 % in 2020 and 2021, respectively. By predator exclusion trials, the Biocontrol Services Index (BSI) was calculated in sampling date, in which the number of aphids on the caged and uncaged branch has significant difference in the four flowering plants and untreated control plots in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Thus, our results suggest that, intercropping flowering plants in insecticide-free apple orchard contributed to increase the number of predators and biological control of aphid Aphis spiraecola. These findings support that intercropping flowering plants as a promising management option could be implemented in apple orchards.

AB  - A series of species introductions, overexploitation, and habitat modification preceded the extirpation of Lahontan cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi; LCT), historically the apex predator, from Lake Tahoe, California-Nevada, USA. Studies evaluating limiting factors for LCT emphasise the need to elucidate food web interactions, yet important knowledge gaps regarding trophic interactions among nonnative pelagic fishes and invertebrates remain. We quantified the abundance and consumption demand of planktivores with an emphasis on kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka) and Mysis diluviana. We synthesised this new information with existing information for lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). The seasonal supply of copepods satisfied the consumption demand of kokanee, but only supported low feeding and growth rates. Kokanee relied heavily on Mysis as prey, an unusual result. Mysis exhibited a high degree of herbivory initially followed by heavier consumption on copepods by larger individuals. Consumption demand for Mysis on copepods exceeded that of kokanee during all seasons. Mysis contributed to over 50% of the annual energy budget for lake trout up to 625 mm. Consumption of Mysis by lake trout and kokanee represented a significant source of mortality when compared to the production of Mysis. Predation on kokanee was sustainable, only involved lake trout >625 mm, and was focused on prespawning aggregations. Despite the presence of Mysis-fueled lake trout, kokanee have persisted; a noteworthy pattern when considering the negative responses of kokanee to nonnative lake trout and Mysis observed elsewhere. This pattern suggests that there may still be an effective niche for LCT in the invaded Lake Tahoe ecosystem.

AB  - The Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus, AUFS) population, currently less than 47% of its pre-harvest size, represents the largest resident marine predator biomass in south-eastern Australia. This region, characterized by low marine productivity and rapid warming, is home to Kanowna Island, the third-largest AUFS colony. Territorial male AUFS, due to size sexual dimorphism, exert a greater influence on trophic dynamics than their conspecifics and serve as indicators of ecosystem health through their body condition index (BCI). Over a 12-year period (2009-2021), BCI data from 547 adult males revealed a significant decline, suggesting deteriorating nutritional conditions. Lower BCI was associated with warmer sea surface temperatures (current-year), higher spring Chlorophyll-a concentrations in southern Tasmanian waters (1-year lag), and stronger Bonney Upwelling westerly winds (2-year lag). Additionally, negative correlations emerged with the Indian Ocean Dipole (current- and 2-year lags), while positive correlations were linked to the Southern Annular Mode and Southern Oscillation Index (1-year and 2-year lags). These findings indicate that climate variability and warming may further impact AUFS male body condition, posing risks to broader demographic parameters and population stability. Long-term monitoring is essential to evaluate ongoing nutritional stress and potential population-level consequences under future climate scenarios.

AB  - IntroductionThe Asian chestnut gall wasp (Dryocosmus kuriphilus) is a major pest of chestnut trees worldwide, seriously affecting chestnut cultivation. Information concerning the effects of gall wasp attack on diameter growth of chestnut trees is currently scarce and limited to coppice stands and to use of the growth of a non-target control species (unaffected by the pest) for reference purposes. The effects of the pest on widely-spaced plantations (grown at a much lower density than chestnut coppices) and the use of explicitly-observed annual infestation rate data remain to be explored. MethodsIn the present study, we analyzed the impact of the chestnut gall wasp on the diameter growth of chestnut trees, using data from 16 experimental plots established in widely-spaced plantations located in good quality sites. Two of the plots are in plantations where a susceptible hybrid chestnut clone and a chestnut clone resistant to the gall wasp coexist, whereas the remaining 14 plots are in Castanea sativa plantations where the level of gall wasp infestation varies across trees and years. The plots were surveyed to determine the diameter growth of the trees and the level of infestation during 5 years (2017-2021). ResultsThe infestation level corresponding to the theoretical damage threshold was surpassed inmost plots during the study period. Nevertheless, there were no differences in the growth of attacked and unaffected plants in the two plots planted with hybrid clones with contrasting susceptibility to the gall wasp. The attack had a modest effect in C. sativa plots, with a mean reduction in annual basal area increment of 9.9%. DiscussionThese findings apparently contradict previous reports of a marked reduction in radial growth of chestnut coppice trees due to gall wasp attack. The difference in findings may be related to increased compensation for herbivory with increasing levels of resources (especially light) in the plantations under study, which were less dense than previously studied stands. The study outcomes add to existing knowledge on the impact of chestnut gall wasp on wood formation and may have implications regarding planting site recommendations and subsequent stand management.

AB  - The Neptune Islands Group and Western Kangaroo Island Marine Parks were declared as part of South Australia's representative system of Marine protected areas (MPAs) in 2009. Sanctuary zones, located within these MPAs, prohibited commercial fishing in the state's Northern Zone Rock Lobster Fishery from 2014. In 2022, dedicated surveys were undertaken both inside and outside two of the sanctuary zones to estimate the relative abundance (catch per unit effort; CPUE) and size of southern rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii). Survey results were then compared to estimates of abundance obtained from long-term commercial fishery-dependent data within each area. The legal-size CPUE by weight of lobsters was 389% and 411% higher inside sanctuary zones of the Neptune Islands Group and Western Kangaroo Island, respectively, compared to outside, based on survey data. Survey catch rates inside the two sanctuary zones were also considerably higher than historical catch rates estimated from commercial fishing data. Lobsters inside both sanctuary zones were larger than those outside in terms of mean weight compared to historical estimates. However, surveys recorded similar mean size in lobsters both inside and outside the Neptune Islands Group sanctuary zone, indicating a possible spillover effect of MPA protection. The Northern Zone Rock Lobster Fishery is currently in a biomass rebuilding phase. The results highlight the productivity potential of temperate reef ecosystems within South Australia in terms of southern rock lobster abundances.

AB  - 1. Urbanisation and anthropogenic alteration of ecosystems has led to conflict between humans and wildlife. Such conflict is often observed in apex predators. Although human-wildlife conflict has been extensively studied, male/female differences in behaviour are rarely considered.
   2. We investigated male/female differences in foraging behaviour of the predatory/scavenging brown skua Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi breeding on a New Zealand island nature reserve in proximity to farmland. These skuas are subject to culling, when perceived as a threat to livestock.
   3. As part of a long-term ecological study, we used high-resolution Global Positioning System (GPS) devices to characterise the space-use of foraging brown skuas. We also analysed stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) from modern and archived blood samples to investigate possible changes in diet over the past similar to 30 years.
   4. Analysis of 100 GPS tracks collected from 2014 to 2016 demonstrated that males and females consistently visited different habitats. Males spent most of their time close to their breeding territory on the island nature reserve and females frequently visited a farmed island approximately two kilometres away. Consistent with this finding, we show that male and female skuas also differed markedly in their diets: males specialised on burrow-nesting white-faced storm petrels Pelagodroma marina (80%) with only a small proportion of sheep remains Ovis aries (<6%) contributing to their diet. In contrast, female diet comprised 27% white-faced storm petrels, other seabirds (18%) and a relatively large proportion of sheep remains (47%). Further, our data (186 blood samples from 122 individuals) show that this male/female difference in diet has persisted at least since 1987.
   5. Because females fed disproportionally on sheep remains, they may be more vulnerable to being culled by farmers. Importantly, our case study suggests that intersexual differences in diet and foraging patterns can have major implications for the reproduction and survival of apex predators that interact with farming. We strongly suggest that intersexual differences in behaviour should be considered when investigating human-wildlife conflicts.

AB  - Trophic interaction modifications occur in food webs when the direct or indirect interaction between two species is affected by a third species. These behavioral modification effects are often referred to as associational effects. Changes in focal resource availability and consumption by a generalist herbivore can affect a range of outcomes from resource exclusion to multiple resources coexisting with the focal plant species. Here, we investigate the indirect interaction between a focal and alternative resource mediated by a generalist consumer. Using theoretical approaches we analyse the conceptual link between associational effects (both resistance and susceptibility) and the theory of apparent competition and resource switching. We find that changes in focal resource traits have the potential to affect the long-term outcome of indirect interactions. Inclusion of density-dependence expands generalist life-histories and broadens the range where, through associational effects, the availability of alternative resources positively influence a focal resource. We conclude that different forms of associational effects could, in the long-term, lead to a range of indirect interaction dynamics, including apparent competition and apparent mutualism. Our work aims to connects the theoretical body of work on indirect interactions to the concepts of associational effects. The indirect interactions between multiple resources need more thorough investigation to appreciate the range of associational effects that could result from the dynamical interaction between a generalist consumers and its focal and alternative resources.

AB  - Short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) are a cryptic and iconic monotreme found throughout the continent of Australia. Despite observational records spanning many years aggregated in national and state biodiversity databases, the spatial and temporal intensity of sightings is limited. Although the species is of least conservation concern at the global level, a subspecies has been declared endangered on Kangaroo Island in South Australia. We need better population data over the whole continent to inform this species' conservation management. To increase the temporal and spatial resolution of observations which may be used for more accurate population assessments, we developed a mobile app for citizen scientists to easily record echidna sightings and improve the quantity, quality and distribution of data collected for monitoring this species. EchidnaCSI is a free, cross-platform (Android & iOS), open-source app that we developed to collect echidna observational data around Australia. EchidnaCSI has been in use since September 2017 and uses mobile phone sensors to transparently and automatically record metadata, such as species observation location and time and GPS location precision. We examine differences in spatial coverage between these observations and those in existing data repositories in the Atlas of Living Australia and state biodiversity databases, especially in relation to observations in protected areas and to an index of remoteness and accessibility. EchidnaCSI has contributed over 8000 echidna observations from around Australia, more than recorded in all state systems combined, with similar spatial distribution. Although coverage was more limited in some protected areas than the reference data sources, numbers of observations in all remote areas were greater than the reference scientific data except for very remote regions. EchidnaCSI has improved the spatial and temporal intensity of observations for this iconic species and provides a complement to scientific surveys, which might usefully focus on highly protected areas and very remote regions.

TI  - The efficacy of wildlife fences for keeping reindeer outside a chronic wasting disease risk area
T2  - ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Emerging wildlife diseases often comes with negative cultural and economic impact. Limiting disease spread is a recurrent goal and challenge, but the efficacy of various mitigation measures is rarely assessed. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a lethal disease among cervids that was discovered among alpine reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in the Nordfjella mountain range of Norway in 2016. After de-population, the entire range was fallowed to avoid re-emergence from environmental pathogen reservoirs. This involved installing perimeter fences in the alpine areas in order to keep reindeer from adjacent populations outside of the CWD risk area, while other cervids (red deer Cervus elaphus, roe deer Capreolus capreolus and moose Alces alces) were likely to enter through the forested areas. We used camera trapping and surveillance reports to assess the efficacy of the perimeter fences. All four species of cervids were documented inside the CWD risk area. For reindeer, only 12.0% of observations were inside the CWD risk area, while this was 28.7% for the other cervids. The higher proportion of observations outside of the fenced area indicate that fences provided a barrier and lowered the number of crossings also of red deer, roe deer and moose. Fences do not provide complete barriers, and we discuss practical solutions for how to avoid 'intruders' entering a given area, such as maintenance at critical points (e.g. river and road crossings) and height of fences (e.g. species variation in jumping; deep snow) to uphold their desired effect. We argue that two fence lines with a buffer zone would be required when re-introduction of reindeer are planned in the CWD risk area after fallowing, similar to what has been suggested for other wildlife diseases.

AB  - Large terrestrial wildlife negatively impacts agricultural livelihoods on all continents except Antarctica. There is growing recognition of the need to reconcile these impacts to achieve socially and ecologically sustainable wildlife conservation agendas. Elk populations in northern California are estimated to have doubled in the past 35 years, marking a conservation success, but also increasing forage loss and damage to infrastructure on private land. Wildlife managers are pursuing the goal of increasing elk numbers on public lands, but elk are preferentially utilizing private pasture and rangeland, driving conflict with beef and dairy producers. We conducted 17 semistructured interviews with private landowners, primarily beef and dairy producers, in northern California to understand their experiences and reactions to elk conflict and state wildlife management. Landowners report that elk density on private rangeland has steadily increased in recent years and poses a threat to their businesses due to loss of forage, damage to fences, and the corresponding liability risk posed by breached fences and errant cattle. The absence of crop and forage loss compensation, difficulty obtaining depredation permits, and low harvest quotas for recreational hunting limit landowner mitigation options and foster resentment toward the state wildlife agency. Most landowners believe that current elk management policies, including restricted hunting opportunities, do not adequately address elk conflict, creating novel challenges for wildlife officials tasked with reconciling elk restoration goals with a variety of stakeholders experiencing economic losses and threats to rural livelihoods. We discuss these issues in the context of common wildlife management challenges, such as building social capital, defining tolerable impacts, and building institutional capacity for alternative solutions within rigid regulatory frameworks. We draw upon environmental economics and common-pool resource theory to suggest that a rethinking of elk management based on local conditions, facilitating damage compensation mechanisms while reducing transaction costs, and increasing participation of local stakeholders in decision making might improve outcomes.

AB  - The iconic giant clams are known for its multifaceted importance throughout the Indo-Pacific -for functional, ecological, or cultural purposes. In Malaysia, habitat destruction and illegal poaching were main reasons behind the declining populations of giant clams. As previous surveys date back to 1990 s, an update on the status of giant clam populations in Malaysia is overdue. Using the extensive monitoring data from Reef Check Malaysia, we analysed and provided an assessment of population trends of giant clams between 2007 and 2021 in Malaysia. This study showed a decline in giant clam population in the east coast Peninsula and Sabah, while their abundances have always been low in the west coast Peninsula and Sarawak. In the east coast Peninsula, Tridacna maxima and T. crocea were most common (2.7 +/- 7.3 and 1.4 +/- 7.6 clams per 100 m2, respectively), followed by T. squamosa (0.7 +/- 1.4 clams per 100 m2), and Hippopus hippopus (0.3 +/- 2.5 clams per 100 m2). The boring species, T. maxima and T. crocea, typically displayed highly aggregated populations, reaching densities of 41.5 and 70 clams per 100 m2, where a reciprocal abundance shift between both species was observed between northern and southern sites of east coast Peninsula. The demography of T. maxima and T. crocea is either positively skewed or normally distributed, indicating abundant recruits that correspond to their higher densities. In contrast, T. squamosa showed a negative skew, suggesting poor recruitment rates. Findings here underscore the need to tailor conservation strategies for respective giant clam species in Malaysia. Proposed initiatives include establishing conservation zones in key areas like Perhentian, Lang Tengah, Redang, and Tioman Islands, which have significant T. maxima and T. crocea recruit populations. Also, targeted restocking efforts are necessary for T. squamosa and H. hippopus to ensure long-term viability of populations.

AB  - Background. Fire modulates herbivore dynamics in open ecosystems. While extensive work demonstrates the interaction between fire and vertebrate grazers, less research describes how grasshopper herbivory dynamics respond to fire. Aim. We examined how fire increased grass crude protein content and increased the density of and offtake by grasshoppers relative to unburned mixed-grass prairie. Methods. We deployed grasshopper exclusion cages to determine grasshopper offtake of aboveground plant biomass, counted grasshopper abundance throughout the study period, and measured crude protein content of aboveground grass biomass. Key results. Offtake and density were higher in burned versus unburned plots. Burned plot grasshopper density increased over time, with greater rates of increase in recently burned plots, while density remained constant in unburned locations. Conclusions. We present a potential mechanism by which fire interacts with grasshoppers in open ecosystems. It is likely that greater grasshopper offtake and density in recently-burned plots is at least partially attributable to higher crude protein content, as grass in these plots has a much higher proportion of recent growth after fire removed senesced material.

AB  - Seagrasses, a unique group of marine flowering plants, profoundly influence the marine environment by providing an array of critical ecological functions. They serve as the foundational habitat for several endangered and charismatic species, including sea cows, sea turtles, and sea horses, and are often referred to as coastal canaries. In comparison to boreal and tropical forests, they have an amazing ability for carbon storage. Despite their long evolutionary history, they are threatened by rapid environmental changes caused by climate change and human activity. Long-term monitoring is required to comprehend the changes in this fragile ecosystem. Conventional field survey methods for collecting long-term data are laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. Hence, this work builds a time-series dataset of the seagrass coverage in the Kalpeni lagoon from 2003 to 2020 by analysing Landsat data on Google Earth Engine. We also evaluated the temporal changes in the seagrass coverage of the study area and studied the influence of selected environmental factors on the seagrass coverage. We observed a negative relationship between sea surface temperature and seagrass coverage. The results revealed a decline in more than 99% of seagrass coverage, indicating an alarming threat to this seagrass ecosystem of the region. With such a drastic shrinkage in the seagrass coverage, the hysteresis must be strong, and the recovery of these meadows may require intensive interventions. By establishing a long-term time series database of seagrass coverage, our study also opens up new avenues for future ecological research on the seagrass meadows.

AB  - Prevention of non-native species introductions and establishment is essential to avoid adverse impacts of invasive species in marine environments. To identify potential new invasive species and inform non-native species management options for the northern Gulf of Mexico (Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas), 138 marine species were risk screened for current and future climate conditions using the Aquatic Species Invasiveness Screening Kit. Species were risk-ranked as low, medium, high, and very high risk based on separate (calibrated) thresholds for fishes, tunicates, and invertebrates. In the basic screening, 15 fishes, two tunicates, and 26 invertebrates were classified as high or very high risk under current climate conditions. Whereas, under future climate conditions, 16 fishes, three tunicates, and 33 invertebrates were classified as high or very high risk. Very high risk species included: California scorpionfish Scorpaena guttata, red scorpionfish Scorpaena scrofa, purple whelk Rapana venosa, and Santo Domingo false mussel Mytilopsis sallei under both current and future climates, with weedy scorpionfish Rhinopias frondosa, Papuan scorpionfish Scorpaenopsis papuensis, daggertooth pike conger Muraenesox cinereus, yellowfin scorpionfish Scorpaenopsis neglecta, tassled scorpionfish Scorpaenopsis oxycephalus, brush-clawed shore crab Hemigrapsus takanoi, honeycomb oyster Hyotissa hyotis, carinate rock shell Indothais lacera, and Asian green mussel Perna viridis under climate change conditions only. This study provides evidence to inform trans-boundary management plans across the five Gulf of Mexico states to prevent, detect, and respond rapidly to new species arrivals.

AB  - Exotic plants can affect native plants indirectly through various biotic interactions. However, combinations of the multiple indirect effects of exotic plants on native plants have been rarely evaluated. Herbivory can either positively or negatively influence plant-pollinator interactions. Here, we addressed whether the pollinator-mediated plant interaction between exotic and native plants is altered through the introduction of exotic herbivores by conducting a 2-year common garden experiment. We compared the effects of pollinator-mediated indirect effects of an exotic plant, Solidago altissima, on the co-flowering native plant Aster microcephalus in geographically different populations reflecting differences in insect herbivore communities. We found a positive effect of co-flowering S. altissima on pollinator visitation of A. microcephalus, which varied between gardens and years. The co-flowering S. altissima did not significantly affect the seed set of A. microcephalus in the first year but had a negative effect in the second year. The facilitative effect of S. altissima on A. microcephalus pollination was suggested to be negatively affected by an exotic aphid, while it was not significantly affected by an exotic lace bug. Our study suggests that the phenology and feeding guilds of the herbivores may be critical for predicting the effect of exotic plants on native plants through herbivore-pollinator interactions. Integrated effects between plant interactions via multiple species interactions under different abiotic and biotic environments are necessary to understand the impact of exotic plants under complex interactions in nature.

AB  - Pterodroma leucoptera caledonica is a subspecies of Gould's Petrel endemic to New Caledonia. Its distribution, abundance and breeding biology are poorly known. Extensive surveys of New Caledonia between 1994 and 2014 located only two breeding colonies, and a further likely, but still unconfirmed; the total estimated size of the population could be of the order of 5000-7000 breeding pairs. Nesting burrows were situated either near streams or on slopes near ridges. The breeding phenology of caledonica was similar to that of the Australian leucoptera, but with a breeding calendar that lagged that of leucoptera by 2-4 weeks depending on year and breeding parameter. Breeding success was low, with evidence of a high level of predation of eggs, chicks and adults by rats, pigs and cats. Pigs also destroyed nesting burrows. Permanent bait stations installed to control rats at one colony appeared successful, but the control of pigs and cats is much more problematic. If, as expected, the level of predation observed at one colony extends across all breeding colonies, population decline is inevitable and extinction likely in the long term. With no populations of P. l. caledonica on predator-free offshore islands, translocation to such sites may be evaluated to safeguard this subspecies. In the meantime, we recommend that the global status of Gould's Petrel Pterodroma leucoptera be upgraded from Vulnerable to Endangered.

AB  - IntroductionSmall stock animal manures have the potential to be used in arid countries to produce vermi-leachate or vermi-teas that can be effectively utilised in the hydroponic production of both leafy and fruity vegetables.Materials & MethodsOur study evaluated the potential of sheep and goat manure vermicompost (SGMVC) as an amendment to cocopeat at varying levels, as well as sheep and goat manure vermi-leachate (SGMVL) diluted at 5%, 10%, and 20%, on crop phytotoxicity, seedling growth, and crop growth and yield.ResultsThe 100% inorganic Hygrotech fertiliser and SGML showed consistently high values for relative root elongation (RRE) and germination index (GI), with values above 90% for most treatments. However, the treatments with less SGMVC incorporation showed phytotoxic effects, with cocopeat alone having the lowest GI and RRE values. However, for direct seed germination, all treatments showed germination percentages above 80% for Swiss chard and above 70% for tomato, including the cocopeat alone treatment, indicating the complementary effects of the SGMVL irrigation source. For Swiss chard, the use of 10% and 20% leachate alone resulted in a 141.8% and 137.5% lower leaf area, respectively, compared to the treatments irrigated with Hygrotech fertiliser. Similarly, for tomatoes, the use of 10% and 20% leachate alone resulted in 129.2% and 143.4% lower leaf areas, respectively, compared to the Hygrotech irrigated treatments. For Swiss chard, the application of 0% VC resulted in an overall 43% reduction in leaf yield, whereas in tomato, it resulted in an overall 44% reduction in tomato fruit yield. The increased yield under 50% VC clearly indicated increased nutrient availability and enhanced water holding capacity of the media compared to when no SGMVC was added.ConclusionThis study showed that Swiss chard and tomato have different nutrient requirements, and the use of SGMVC should not be based on blanket recommendations from one crop. In addition, the use of reduced inorganic soluble fertilisers in combination with SGMVC has no economic benefits, as this reduced yield is almost proportional to the level of soluble fertiliser reduction.

AB  - The Hebrides of Scotland constitute a unique set of island environments with a long history of human settlement and agriculture. Earthworm community surveys were undertaken in selected agricultural landscapes of Inner (Isle of Rum) and Outer (North and South Uist) Hebrides. On North Uist, earthworms were sampled from areas of Blackland (organic, anthropic, acidic agricultural soils) and on South Uist in machair (sandy, fertile, low-lying grassy pasture). Specific grassland and cultivated areas with various organic additions - including dung and seaweed - were targeted, using hand-sorting of soil for earthworms plus mustard vermifuge extraction. Work on Rum investigated earthworms in ridge and furrow (lazybed) agricultural systems, abandoned almost 200 years ago and since uncultivated, but grazed by ungulates. On the Uists, nine earthworm species were identified, representing all three ecological categories, but dominated by the epigeics, Dendrobaena octaedra and Lumbricus rubellus. Densities and biomasses across Blackland soils ranged from 10-130 ind. m- 2 and 2.3-33.7 g m- 2, respectively. Here, 5 species were present, and management had a significant effect on species richness and abundance with most earthworms present in recently restored lazybeds. In the machair soils, the corresponding measurements were 4-220 ind. m- 2 and 0.8-89.0 g m- 2. Significantly higher earthworm densities and biomasses were recovered below cattle dung pats compared with dung-free areas. Cultivated areas in machair were less diverse and had lower earthworm densities than uncultivated. On Rum, ridge and furrow abundances did not differ clearly with 24-102 and 34-112 ind. m- 2 respectively and biomasses of 7.4-26.3 and 8.8-30.8 g m- 2. Here, Aporrectodea caliginosa (49%), L. rubellus (23%) and Dendrodrilus rubidus (19%) dominated of the seven species found. Further research on earthworms in the Hebrides is warranted.

AB  - Understanding the threats faced by a bird species requires a knowledge of their movements throughout the annual cycle and, for migratory species, the degree of connectivity between breeding and wintering sites. We studied the philopatry of Snowy Owls (Bubo scandiacus) tagged in central North America to their wintering sites on the Canadian prairies. The tracking of 16 owls over a period spanning six winters revealed consistent and predictable north-south migration trajectories, in contrast to populations farther to the west and east. Individuals were strongly philopatric to the central prairie region, but at a finer spatial scale, winter home ranges did not always overlap between successive years. Both sexes showed periods of nomadic searching for prey over a similar spatial scale, but males tended to settle closer to previous home ranges on average (88 km) than females (149 km). We hypothesize that the socially dominant females are better able to monopolize the spatially unpredictable hotspots of small mammal prey whereas males rely more on familiarity with a previous home range when settling. The population of Snowy Owls in central North America thus shows greater connectivity to wintering sites than do Snowy Owls documented elsewhere, probably related to the relatively high abundance and predictability of small mammal prey on the prairies. Maintaining prairie habitat on a large spatial scale that supports small rodents will be crucial to maintaining populations of Snowy Owls in the central part of the continent.

AB  - Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in livestock (cattle and farmed deer) is the focus of an in-progress eradication program in New Zealand. The program includes intensive brushtail possum population control as this species is a bTB host and could compromise eradication at a national level. Ten causal criteria (strength of association, experiment, temporality, plausible mechanism, biological gradient, consistency, coherence, specificity, analogy, validated causal predictions) were used to evaluate annual changes in bTB status in livestock herds relative to costs of possum population control and livestock bTB disease control. Hypotheses were evaluated using a model selection framework of the causal relationship between efforts (costs) and outcomes (bTB-infected herds) following management. The 10 causal criteria were demonstrated empirically. Experiments used designs from the simplest pretest-posttest comparison to a before-after-control-impact design, though lacked random allocation of treatments to experimental units and some studies lacked statistical analyses. As hypothesised, the annual changes in bTB-infected herds were positively related to annual costs. The predicted damped oscillations across years in annual changes in bTB-infected herds were observed. The implications are that eradication of livestock bTB appears likely, though there is a risk that eradication may not be achieved by 2026, unless annual control expenditure is higher and/or more efficient in the future.

AB  - This research paper delves into the two-dimensional discrete plant-herbivore model. In this model, herbivores are food-limited and affect the plants' density in their environment. Our analysis reveals that this system has equilibrium points of extinction, exclusion, and coexistence. We analyze the behavior of solutions near these points and prove that the extinction and exclusion equilibrium points are globally asymptotically stable in certain parameter regions. At the boundary equilibrium, we prove the existence of transcritical and perioddoubling bifurcations with stable two-cycle. Transcritical bifurcation occurs when the plant's maximum growth rate or food-limited parameter reaches a specific boundary. This boundary serves as an invasion boundary for populations of plants or herbivores. At the interior equilibrium, we prove the occurrence of transcritical, Neimark-Sacker, and period-doubling bifurcations with an unstable two-cycle. Our research also establishes that the system is persistent in certain regions of the first quadrant. We demonstrate that the local asymptotic stability of the interior equilibrium does not guarantee the system's persistence. Bistability exists between boundary attractors (logistic dynamics) and interior equilibrium for specific parameters' regions. We conclude that changes to the food-limitation parameter can significantly alter the system's dynamic behavior. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct numerical simulations.

AB  - What drives the composition of invaded communities and the local abundance of introduced species are key questions in ecology. Community-assembly theory provides a useful framework for addressing these questions. Specifically, the environmental filtering model of community assembly predicts that a species' presence and abundance in a community depend on the interaction between its functional traits and the local environmental filters. However, for introduced species, larger-scale dispersal and introduction-related filters may restrict their regional trait pool. Here, we tested this framework using long-term data from 50+ years of old-field vegetation succession. We asked whether native and introduced plant assemblages followed the same trait-based assembly rules. We also asked whether local functional dissimilarities between the two can be explained by regional species pool differences, a possibility that has rarely been addressed. We found strong similarities in the assembly processes of native and introduced plants. Average height and seed mass of both groups increased over time, consistent with previous studies of old-field succession. Moreover, the two showed similar trait-abundance relationships. While there were also some differences, particularly in their trait-incidence relationships, these differences appeared to be minor. Furthermore, we identified species pool constraints on introduced species and found that the exotic species pool was biased towards early successional traits. Lastly, we found that highly invasive exotic species were also likely to deviate from the expected trait-abundance relationship, suggesting a link between the two. These results imply that introduced species generally follow the same assembly rules as native species. They also indicate that species pool differences can result in local functional composition differences, even when the two groups follow the same assembly rules. Moreover, there may be a link between species invasiveness and deviation from assembly rules, which, if further confirmed, provides a potential method of identifying strong invaders. Synthesis: Using data from a long-term succession study, we showed several similarities, and some differences, in the assembly of native and introduced species assemblages. Our results provide a better understanding of the factors constraining and allowing invasion, and help in the identification of 'rule breaking' invaders.
   Using data from a long-term successional study, the authors found that introduced plant species generally followed the same trait-based assembly rules as native species, but were limited by lower species pool variation. However, highly invasive species were likely to deviate from the trait-abundance relationship shown by the rest of the community, suggesting a link between invasiveness and 'breaking' assembly rules.image

AB  - Microbial nitrogen (N) limitation is a common problem in terrestrial ecosystems. Pig manure, a type of solid waste, is increasingly applied to improve soil N availability in agriculture through inputs of organic matter and inorganic N. Pig manure application also introduces a lot of exogenous microorganisms, which have distinctly different N requirements and metabolic properties, into the resident soil microbial community. However, the impacts of these manure-borne microorganisms on soil N cycling have not been well determined. Here, we investigated effects of manure-borne microorganisms on the N limitation of soil microorganisms using an ecoenzymatic stoichiometry analysis. We monitored microbial communities over a 90-day period in a laboratory-controlled experiment with four treatments: (1) non-sterilized soil mixed with non-sterilized manure (S-M), (2) non-sterilized soil mixed with sterilized manure (S-sM), (3) sterilized soil mixed with non-sterilized manure (sS-M), and (4) non-sterilized soil without manure addition (S, the control). The microbial N limitations were significantly mitigated in both S-M and sS-M. By contrast, the S-sM and S showed high levels of microbial N limitation, likely stemming from differences in the microbial functional composition. We found chitin-degrading bacteria were the dominant copiotrophic manure-borne bacteria associated with N mineralization, and they may improve soil N availability. We further identified several copiotrophic manure-borne bacteria in S-M and sS-M, and their abundances had significantly negative correlation with the level of N limitation and significantly positive correlation with the stoichiometric homeostasis. As these copiotrophic taxa can maintain homeostasis through regulating enzymatic activities, our results indicate that copiotrophic taxa in pig manure contribute to the mitigation of soil microbial N limitation. Our study also highlights the invasiveness capacity of manure-borne microorganisms in soil and evaluates the biotic effects of manure application on soil N cycling.

AB  - Background: Grasslands are the primary source of feed for grazing livestock, and as such, knowledge on how to best manage livestock and grasslands, through the use of spatiotemporal modelling, will assist in the long-term management of a valuable ecosystem resource.
   Methods: This study was conducted over 14 months between March and April 2017 in Orange, NSW, Australia. The study evaluated sheep behaviour in relation to the presence of pasture species, environment and paddock structures, using random forest modelling, to predict sheep location under continuous high (HSR, 13DSEha(-1)) and low (LSR, 7DSEha(-1)) stocking rates.
   Results: In the LSR, significant drivers included water, shade and fence lines (p<0.01). In the HSR, only fence lines and available biomass were found to be significant (p<0.01). The presence of green legumes in both stocking rates often increased residency by sheep. Animals spent more time together in the LSR, suggesting that social behaviour played a larger role than pasture quantity and quality in driving grazing behaviours.
   Conclusions: Understanding how pasture type can influence grazing behaviours and also how animal behaviour affects pasture performance and utilisation is important in developing long-term sustainable management strategies on a paddock scale.

AB  - Rapid developments associated with large-scale transport infrastructure have exacerbated ecological risks, posing major threats to biodiversity and ecosystem services. Construction of ecological security patterns (ESPs) can effectively mitigate this threat, but existing construction of ESPs lacks consideration of the risk to landscape connectivity and resilience, as well as zoning optimization at a finer resolution. This study focused on the region along the China-Laos Railway to evaluate the landscape ecological risk (LER) based on the potential -connectedness-resilience framework and extracted ESP elements according to the LER evaluation. Clustering of LER and ecological quality index was introduced to facilitate more targeted management of ESP. We found that the regional LER was most likely elevated because the proportion of LER at the medium level and above was close to 50 %. Moreover, the segmentation and penetration of high-risk areas into low-risk areas was prominent. The distribution of low LER areas was notably shaped by regional resilience, while road expansion would create many medium and higher risk areas, and the development of industrial parks would generate high risks in urban peripheries. 2,615.88 km of ecological corridors enabled the 17,362.08 km2 ecological sources to be effectively connected. 33 ecological nodes and 115 stepping stones were extracted as valid complements to key areas of weak connectivity. Priority treatment of specific sources (4.88 %) and ecological corridors (29.93 %) enhances the resilience of ESP. Our study provides a method for integrating the assessment of ecological risks arising from future regional development with the construction and optimization of ESPs, which can be promoted in ecological conservation planning in developing countries driven by infrastructure and industrial parks.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries provide nutrients to hundreds of millions of people worldwide, with yields dependent on the condition of marine habitats such as coral reefs. Small-scale fisheries are a particularly important food source in societies with nutrient deficiencies and where unhealthy food alternatives are widely available. Using data from coral reef surveys around two islands in French Polynesia (Moorea and Raiatea), we show how the availability of nutrients to fisheries changed in relation to the condition of coral habitat. Fish biomass and nutrient availability were highest when coral cover was low around both islands, driven predominantly by abundant herbivorous reef fish. We also investigated the importance of fish in people's diets, to determine if fish consumption was aligned with available fisheries resources on local reefs and if nutrient intakes from fish could be explained by people's socioeconomic background. People ate a higher diversity of reef fish in Raiatea, however nutrient intakes from fish were higher in Moorea. Most people ate more fish than meat on both islands, however fish consumption declined over generations. People from fishing households had higher nutrient intakes from reef and pelagic fish, and people from farming households had higher intakes from reef fish. Preference for eating reef fish over pelagic fish was also associated with higher total nutrient intakes. Promoting traditional diets rich in fish could be key to meeting people's nutritional needs in French Polynesia while reducing diet-related health issues linked to the overconsumption of fat.

AB  - This paper analyzes the current use pattern, farmers' preferences, and conservation issues of fodders and forages growing in the agropastoral semi-arid lowlands of Kasur District, Pakistan. The data was collected through semi-structured interviews and participatory methodologies. Multiple data analyses (Relative frequency citation and Pairwise Comparison) and statistical tools (correlation and Tableau) were used for interpretations of ethnobotanical data. The current study reported 75 fodder/forage species belonging to 58 genera and 25 families. Poaceae (28%) was the most popular family followed by Fabaceae (20%). Most of the plants were herbaceous (40%) and were growing in the wild (85.3%). It was observed that livestock preferred shoot consumption (50%) in comparison to other parts. In addition, 37.3% of species were used as fresh feed, 44% of species were freely grazed and 18.7% were used as mixed feed. These plants were more palatable to goats (29%) followed by cows (23%), buffalos (20%), and sheep (15%). Moreover, 23 plants were considered to be high-value fodders and 08 species (Dicliptera bipleuroides, Ehretia acuminate, Kochia indica, Cassia obtusifolia, Melilotus albus, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, Poa pratensis and Lycium shawii) were recorded as fodder/forage for the first time in this geographical regime. Results reported only 7% abundant and 3% rare species in the study area which reflected the overexploitation of these natural feed resources. This study provided baseline data for the development of feeding strategies and also highlighted a serious conservation concern of these fodder plants. Proper cultivation, farming and in-situ conservation would underpin the sustainability of these plant resources.

AB  - For small ectotherm species, dealing with microclimatic variation during sensitive stages of their development is a critical component of their ecological interactions within and among different landscape settings. However, it is often unknown whether the use of habitats in different landscape settings may affect microclimatic conditions at the level of microhabitats (e.g., at host plants for herbivorous insects). As opposed to standard ecological monitoring experiments, we aim to identify the microclimatic variables that accurately represent the environment in which a small arthropod spends most of its life. As a case study, we selected grassy sites that corresponded to the microhabitat of grass-feeding insects in general, and larvae of the butterfly Pararge aegeria in particular, as this insect recently expanded its habitat use from forest (edges) to agricultural and urban environments. We tested the extent to which local microclimates and microclimatic buffering capacity differed between tufts of grass in forest and in two anthropogenic (i.e., agricultural and urban) landscape settings by measuring microclimatic variables with sensors at the level of the grasses. We compared temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) during an exceptionally warm and dry summer period with parallel data from weather stations and tested for differences between microclimatic profiles among the three landscape settings. Microclimatic conditions correspond only partly to variables based on weather station data. Differences are particularly significant for relative humidity and VPD, but not for day and night temperatures. Effects of canopy openness on the variability of microclimatic variables are landscape-specific. Host plants in agricultural settings experience strong microclimatic fluctuations and low short-term variability in VPD. In urban settings, urban heat island effects increase night temperature but also show microclimatic buffering effects similar to the ones in forest settings. Our findings stress the functional implications of landscape-specific microclimatic profiles at the appropriate organism-centered scale. We discuss the significance of such microclimatic profiles for ecological studies dealing with ectotherms under climate and land use change.

AB  - Gut microbiota play a fundamental role in the nutrition of many vertebrate herbivores through foregut and hindgut fermentation of plant carbohydrates. Some species of marine herbivorous fishes contain moderate to high levels of short-chain fatty acids in the hindgut, indicating the importance of hindgut fermentation. Herbivorous fish hindgut microbiota are diverse and can vary with geographic location, but data on the scale of geographic variation involving a few km of separation are limited. Here, we used the 16S rRNA gene to describe community composition of the gut microbiota of the herbivorous species Kyphosus vaigiensis and K. cinerascens collected in the vicinity of Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, in 2011 and 2017. Microbiota community structure differed between posterior hindgut sections, host species, sampling years and two mid-shelf and outer reef locations approximately 20 km apart. Hindgut bacterial community composition varied remarkably between mid-shelf and outer reef locations, and among individual fish on the mid-shelf reef. In both fish species, the most abundant phyla were Pseudomonadota, Bacillota and Bacteroidota, followed by Spirochaetota, Thermodesulfobacteriota and Verrucomicrobiota. There were no clear differences between the host species in terms of the relative abundance and composition of bacterial genera in outer reef samples. In contrast, the dominant genera differed between mid-shelf samples of K. cinerascens and K. vaigiensis, being Endozoicomonas-like (Pseudomonadota) and Brevinema (Spirochaetota), respectively. Endozoicomonas are emerging as important symbionts in many marine hosts worldwide and are thought to be important in the coral sulphur cycle. Differences in microbiota composition were not associated with variation in fish condition, suggesting that the different microbial taxa perform equivalent functional roles.

AB  - The reduction and fragmentation of forests due to human activities are two primary factors that have led to forest biodiversity losses. The lack of forest continuation may prevent organisms from escaping areas that are no longer habitable due to altered environmental conditions and the reduction in size of habitat regions. Therefore, protecting and promoting forest connectivity has become one of the important objectives of forest management. The forests were regarded as independent elements, and the connectivity of the forest itself was directly evaluated in previous studies. However, this approach ignores the maintenance of forest connectivity, while requiring the participation of other landscape elements. In this study, we indirectly determine the forest priority by evaluating the landscape priority by integrating analysis with the habitat suitability (HS) model, MSPA and and BCkPC and dPC(k) index. We studied the wild boar (Sus scrofa) habitats in and around Hupingshan and Houhe National Nature Reserves to illustrate the indirect evaluation method of forest priority. The results showed that forests with high priority, medium priority, low priority, and non-priority comprised 596, 64, 58 and 105 km(2), respectively, accounting for the 41.2, 2.7, 3.0, and 11.9% of the total forest area. Our research revealed that evaluating the forest priority by analysing the landscape priority was an effective method for forest priority identification, and this strategy can be used to other regions or species for the goal of identifying the forest priority for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - The impact of wildlife-vehicle collisions on drivers and wildlife populations has been gaining attention in the United States. Given the established success of wildlife crossings with fencing in reducing wildlife crashes and connecting habitat, information is needed on cost-effective means of implementation for departments of transportation. When wildlife crossings are constructed, they are often built into new road projects as a series of 2 or more underpasses and/or overpass structures connected by exclusionary fencing. Given limited transportation budgets and the prevalence of maintenance activities more so than new construction in many states, enhancing existing underpasses on previously constructed roads has been recognized as a cost-effective mitigation opportunity. More research is needed, however, on the effects of adding fencing to existing underpasses, particularly those that are too far from one another to be connected with contiguous fencing. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of this measure when applied to isolated underpasses. Approximately 1.6 km of 2.4-m-high wildlife fencing was added to each of 2 existing underpasses, a large bridge underpass and a large box culvert, situated approximately 8 km apart from one another on Interstate 64 in Virginia, USA. We conducted a 2-year post-fencing camera monitoring study and compared the findings from a 2-year pre-fencing study with regard to collision frequencies with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and black bears (Ursus americanus); the use of the underpasses by wildlife; and roadside deer activity. We also evaluated deer activity data to compare different fence end designs applied at the study sites. After fencing installation, deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) were reduced by 96.5% and 88% at the box culvert and bridge underpass, respectively, and there were no increases in DVCs within 1.6 km of the fence ends. Deer crossings increased 410% at the box culvert and 71% at the bridge underpass. Use of the culvert and bridge underpasses by other mammals increased 81% and 165%, respectively. Although deer use of the underpasses was much greater than their activity at any of the fence ends, there was relatively high deer activity at the fence ends that did not tie into a feature such as right-of-way fencing. Our study found that the addition of wildlife fencing to certain existing isolated underpasses can be a highly cost-effective means of increasing driver safety and enhancing habitat connectivity for wildlife. The benefits from crash reduction exceeded the fencing costs in 1.8 years, and fencing resulted in an average saving of >$2.3 million per site over the 25-year lifetime of the fencing. The results add to the growing body of knowledge about effective ways we can use existing infrastructure to connect wildlife habitat and increase driver safety.

AB  - Southern Texas, USA, is home to native collared peccaries (Dicotyles tajacu) and introduced populations of invasive wild pigs (generally Sus scrofa x domesticus hybrids) and non-native African warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus). Although these ecologically similar mammals co-occur in this region, the potential impacts of invasive suids on collared peccaries are poorly understood. We examined co-occupancy and activity pattern overlap of collared peccaries, wild pigs, and warthogs across 3 seasons (fall, winter, and spring) using remote camera data collected from Chaparral Wildlife Management Area, Cotulla, Texas (November 2020 to June 2021). Using activity pattern analyses and single and 2-species occupancy models incorporating habitat and climate characteristics, we found evidence of extensive spatial overlap between all species pairs and varying degrees of temporal overlap depending on species pairs and season. Collared peccaries and wild pigs displayed moderate temporal overlap across all seasons. Collared peccaries appeared to alter fall activity in the presence of wild pigs to be active earlier in the morning and less active during the day. Collared peccaries and warthogs had low-to-moderate temporal overlap (low in fall, winter; moderate in spring). Wild pigs and warthogs had low temporal overlap (fall, spring) and wild pigs appeared to alter activity in the presence of warthogs (fall), becoming less active during the day during peak warthog activity. Overall, our results suggest that peccary, wild pig, and warthog interactions and activity are dynamic and vary seasonally according to the ecology and preferred environmental conditions of each species. Given the potential for interspecific competition and disease transmission with Collared Peccary and other native wildlife, resource partitioning between wild pigs and warthogs needs to be further examined to aid in effective management strategies.
   Native Collared Peccary and non-native wild pigs and warthogs show extensive spatial overlap in portions of southern Texas and varying degrees of temporal overlap depending on species pairs, indicating potential for species interactions. These patterns are dynamic and vary throughout the year according to ecology and preferred environmental conditions for each species.
   El sur de Texas, EE. UU., es el hogar del jabal & iacute; nativo o pecar & iacute; (Dicotyles tajacu) y de poblaciones introducidas de cerdos salvajes invasores (generalmente h & iacute;bridos de Sus scrofa x domesticus) y fac & oacute;queros africanos no nativos (Phacochoerus africanus). Aunque estos mam & iacute;feros ecol & oacute;gicamente similares coexisten en esta regi & oacute;n, los posibles impactos de los suidos invasores sobre el pecar & iacute; nativo son poco conocidos. Examinamos la co-ocupaci & oacute;n y la superposici & oacute;n de patrones de actividad del pecar & iacute;, los cerdos salvajes y los fac & oacute;queros a lo largo de tres estaciones (oto & ntilde;o, invierno, primavera) utilizando datos de c & aacute;maras remotas recopilados en el & Aacute;rea de Manejo de Vida Silvestre de Chaparral, Cotulla, Texas (noviembre de 2020 a junio de 2021). Utilizando an & aacute;lisis de patrones de actividad y modelos de ocupaci & oacute;n de una y dos especies que incorporan caracter & iacute;sticas del h & aacute;bitat y el clima, encontramos evidencia de una amplia superposici & oacute;n espacial entre todos los pares de especies y diversos grados de superposici & oacute;n temporal seg & uacute;n los pares de especies y la estaci & oacute;n. El pecar & iacute; y los cerdos salvajes mostraron una superposici & oacute;n temporal moderada en todas las estaciones. Los pecar & iacute;es parecen alterar su actividad oto & ntilde;al en presencia de cerdos salvajes, para estar activos m & aacute;s temprano en la ma & ntilde;ana y menos activos durante el d & iacute;a. Los pecar & iacute;es y los fac & oacute;queros muestran una superposici & oacute;n temporal baja a moderada (baja: oto & ntilde;o, invierno; moderada: primavera). Los cerdos salvajes y los fac & oacute;queros tienen una superposici & oacute;n temporal baja (oto & ntilde;o, primavera) y los primeros parecen alterar su actividad en presencia de fac & oacute;queros (oto & ntilde;o), volvi & eacute;ndose menos activos durante el d & iacute;a durante la actividad m & aacute;xima de los fac & oacute;queros. En general, nuestros resultados sugieren que las interacciones y la actividad de los pecar & iacute;es, los cerdos salvajes y los fac & oacute;queros son din & aacute;micas y var & iacute;an estacionalmente seg & uacute;n la ecolog & iacute;a y las condiciones ambientales de las especies. Dado el potencial de competencia interespec & iacute;fica y transmisi & oacute;n de enfermedades con los pecar & iacute;es y otros animales salvajes nativos, la repartici & oacute;n de recursos entre los cerdos salvajes y los fac & oacute;queros necesita ser examinada m & aacute;s a fondo para ayudar a desarrollar estrategias de gesti & oacute;n efectivas para reducir los impactos en las comunidades de animales salvajes nativos.

AB  - We assessed the relative importance of wilderness to gray wolf (Canis lupus) population dynamics over 50 years in a population that 1) was long extant (i.e., not reintroduced or recolonized), 2) was not subject to harvest in our study area until recently, and 3) used both wilderness and adjacent, mainly public, non-wilderness. We analyzed the survival of radiocollared wolves (n = 756 collared-wolf tenures) during 1968-2018 in the Superior National Forest, Minnesota, USA, including the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Over 50 years, adult annual survival was 78%. Wolves captured in wilderness tended to exhibit higher survival than those captured in nonwilderness, but the difference was more pronounced during harvest years and post-harvest years when wilderness wolf survival remained relatively high and non-wilderness wolf survival dropped (relative to pre-harvest). During Nov-Apr of pre-harvest years for adults, the natural mortality rate was similar for non-wilderness wolves and wilderness wolves (both 6%), but the anthropogenic mortality rate was higher for non-wilderness wolves than wilderness wolves (7% versus 1%), as was the illegal mortality rate (5% versus 1%). During Nov-Apr of preharvest years, wilderness wolves were less likely to die than non-wilderness wolves (p = 0.042; hazard ratio = 0.59), pups were more likely to die than adults (p = 0.002; hazard ratio = 1.84), and males were less likely to die than females (p = 0.053; hazard ratio = 0.73). Our long-term wolf survival, cause-specific mortality, and hazard results will inform management agencies whenever wolves are delisted, and jurisdiction for them passes to states.

AB  - A first hand study regarding the anomuran crabs in the intertidal zone of Kadmat and Amini islands of Lakshadweep was carried out during November 2021 to June 2022 by monthly sampling from a total of six sampling stations selected covering the total coastal stretch of Kadmat and Amini islands. The study recorded a total nine species, contributed by eight species of hermit crabs belonging to three genera and two families of superfamily Paguroidea and single species of mole crab of superfamily Hippoidea. The hermit crabs are Coenobita perlatus, Coenobita clypeatus, Calcinus laevimanus, Calcinus latens, Calcinus elegans, Dardanus megistos, Dardanus guttatus and Dardanus deformis. The single species of mole crab is Hippa adactyla. The spatial and temporal variations with respect to abundance and distribution were assessed. The peak average abundance of anomurans was recorded in April and lowest values in December. The northern part of Kadmat Island had the highest total abundance of the anomurans and the east side had the lowest. The most dominant species was Hippa adactyla with maximum records in April. Among hermit crabs the dominant species was C. perlatus, while the least abundant species among anomuran was D. megistos. The distribution and abundance of species differed according to habitat variability. These crabs are used by the local inhabitants of Lakshadweep as bait for fishing, rarely as food and often as a quick remedy for treating cough in children. An interesting traditional use of hermit crab as laxative agent to prevent theft of 'Neera'. Nowadays unscientific coastal protection structures and other anthropogenic interventions becoming a serious threat to these anomuran crabs.

AB  - The impacts of extensively managed sheep on the natural environment has received little attention in comparison to beef and dairy cattle in New Zealand. In particular, there is a paucity of information on the interaction of sheep with natural waterways and their impact on water quality. The current study was designed to determine the behaviour of sheep on a hill country paddock, which was transected by a natural waterway, and assessed measures of water quality during winter conditions. The study also investigated sheep behaviour and impact on the water quality of the waterway when they had access to a reticulated water trough. Observations of behaviour showed that sheep spent little time near the waterway compared to other areas of the paddock. In addition, access to a water trough had no effect on ewe time spent grazing, walking, resting, and drinking. Ewes had minimal interaction with the waterway. Hence, under the current conditions of the study, sheep had little impact on the waterway. This may have been due to the high moisture content of pasture during winter; thus, the sheep were not required to interact with the waterway.
   Access of livestock, such as cattle, to waterways has been shown to be a cause of poor water quality due to pugging damage and excretion entering the water. In New Zealand, regulations require that cattle, deer, and pigs are excluded from accessing waterways, but there are no such requirements for sheep. The current study utilised 24 h video cameras, global positioning system units, and triaxial accelerometers to observe the interaction of Romney ewes (n = 40) with a natural waterway. Ewes were either restricted (week 1) or given access to a reticulated water trough (week 2). Proximity data showed that ewes spent more time within 3 m of the waterway when the trough was unrestricted than when restricted (14.1 +/- 5.7 and 10.8 +/- 5.1 min/ewe/day, respectively; p < 0.05). Ewes travelled shorter distances on the steeper areas of paddock than flatter areas. Similarly, ewes showed a spatial preference for the flat and low sloped areas of the paddock. Concentrations of suspended sediment and total phosphorus were higher during access to a reticulated water trough which coincided with the week with more rainy days. Phosphorus and E. coli concentrations in the stream water samples were the above recommended Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council water quality guidelines, especially after rainy days, but did not appear to be directly related to sheep activity. Overall, the results suggest that during winter, ewes interacted very little with the waterway and were thus unlikely to influence the levels of nutrient and pathogens in the waterway.

AB  - The results of long-term observations are summed up, making it possible to assess patterns and identify the reasons for changes in the numbers, current distribution, and interspecific relationships of ungulates in the Ussuriysky Nature Reserve. A comparison of archival materials and data from the last decade shows that changes in the abundance and distribution of most ungulate species in the reserve are inextricably linked with the increase in the number of sika deer. After the introduction of this species into the territory over 70 years, its number increased from 25 to 1180 individuals, and the population density reached an average of 30 individuals/1000 ha. Over the same period, the number of red deer in the Ussuriysky Nature Reserve decreased from 450 to 130 individuals, that is, more than three times. In the Suvorovsky forestry, there is currently a decrease in the number by about half (from 250-280 to 110 individuals); in the Komarovsky forestry, the number has decreased by about 10 times (from 180-200 to 15-20 individuals). The number and distribution of roe, musk deer, and wild boar in the territory has not changed as obviously. The current number of roe in the reserve is 170 individuals, with a population density of 4 individuals/1000 ha. The number of wild boars is about 200 individuals, with a population density of 4-5 individuals/1000 ha. The accounting methodology that was developed and applied has made it possible to obtain reliable data on the number and distribution of ungulates throughout the Ussuriysky Nature Reserve. There are concerns about a further increase in the number of sika deer in connection with the implementation of biotechnical measures in the reserve.

AB  - Understanding how environmental stressors impact fisheries is imperative for the sustainable management of our marine resources. Synchrony in inter-annual growth patterns among individuals and populations has been identified across large spatial scales, both within and among species. This synchrony indicates a detectable sensitivity to changes in climatic or environmental conditions. We explored within-region effects of environmental and climatic variability using inter-annual otolith growth rates (increments) in a tropical coral reef fish, Naso unicornis. Dendrochronology techniques were applied to remove age-specific growth effects and extract a high-frequency variability signal indicative of short-term environmental change. Using linear mixed-effects models, we identified best predictors of the variation in growth at two adjacent latitude subsets in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. We found different latitude subset growth responses for the years 2000-2013 and 2005-2017, indicating independent fluctuations in growth across latitude however, synchrony was present among individuals within a latitude range. Local environmental processes were more important than regional climatic processes for explaining N. unicornis growth in the north, but in the central islands, neither process had a clear effect. Otolith growth in fish inhabiting the north had a positive response to increased annual average sea surface temperature (SST). In adjacent central islands, otolith growth responded negatively to warmer winter SST. Baseline information for most fisheries on the direct impact of external forcings on fish, especially in tropical coral reef fisheries, remains sparse. We provide information on how climate and environment have impacted past growth with implications for future fisheries productivity monitoring.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetries (FA) are small stress-induced random deviations from perfect symmetry that arise during the development of bilaterally symmetrical traits. One of the factors that can reduce developmental stability of the individuals and cause FA at a population level is the loss of genetic variation. Populations of founding colonists frequently have lower genetic variation than their ancestral populations that could be reflected in a higher level of FA. The European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) is native to Eurasia and was introduced successfully in the USA in 1890 and Argentina in 1983. In this study, we documented the genetic diversity and FA of starlings from England (ancestral population), USA (primary introduction) and Argentina (secondary introduction). We predicted the Argentinean starlings would have the highest level of FA and lowest genetic diversity of the three populations. We captured wild adult European starlings in England, USA, and Argentina, measured their mtDNA diversity and allowed them to molt under standardized conditions to evaluate their FA of primary feathers. For genetic analyses, we extracted DNA from blood samples of individuals from Argentina and USA and from feather samples from individuals from England and sequenced the mitochondrial control region. Starlings in Argentina showed the highest composite FA and exhibited the lowest haplotype and nucleotide diversity. The USA population showed a level of FA and genetic diversity similar to the native population. Therefore, the level of asymmetry and genetic diversity found among these populations was consistent with our predictions based on their invasion history.

AB  - Fish microbiome science is progressing fast, but it is biased toward farmed or laboratory fish species against natural fish populations, which remain considerably underinvestigated. We analyzed the midgut bacterial microbiota of 45 specimens of 12 fish species collected from the Gyaros Island marine protected area (Aegean Sea, Greece). The species belong to seven taxonomic families and are either herbivores or omnivores. Mucosa midgut bacterial diversity was assessed by amplicon metabarcoding of the 16S rRNA V3-V4 gene region. A total of 854 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified. In each fish species, between 2 and 18 OTUs dominated with cumulative relative abundance >= 70%. Most of the dominating bacterial taxa have been reported to occur both in wild and farmed fish populations. The midgut bacterial communities were different among the 12 fish species, except for Pagrus pagrus and Pagellus erythrinus, which belong to the Sparidae family. No differentiation of the midgut bacterial microbiota was found based on feeding habits, i.e., omnivorous vs. carnivorous. Comparing wild and farmed P. pagrus midgut bacterial microbiota revealed considerable variation between them. Our results expand the gut microbiota of wild fish and support the host species effect as the more likely factor shaping intestinal bacterial microbiota.

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of Britain and Ireland: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation.<br /> Silene uniflora is a mat-like perennial herb that in Britain and Ireland is primarily distributed in coastal habitats, notably on sea cliffs and shingle banks but also at the drift line and rarely on sand; it also has populations on mountains and heavy metal mine waste tips. All of these substrates tend to be oligotrophic, loose-textured and freely draining, and often with adverse ion concentrations. It is found in suitable habitats around much of the Atlantic and Baltic coasts of Europe.<br /> Its breeding system is gynodioecious and gynomonoecious (some individuals bearing female flowers only, some bearing hermaphrodite flowers only and others with both types of flower). The proportions of the three types of individual vary considerably between populations, but hermaphrodite flowers tend to predominate. The showy, white, nectar-producing flowers are produced continuously over the entire summer and are pollinated mainly by long-tongued Hymenoptera and night-flying moths but autogamous selfing is also frequent.<br /> Silene uniflora and its close relative S. vulgaris were the subject of a classic, decadal study involving genetical and transplant experiments that was seminal in the development of 'experimental taxonomy'. More recently, attention has focused on the rapid evolution of Zn-tolerant populations of S. uniflora growing on mine spoil and contaminated river gravels. It has also become a model organism for the study of sexually transmitted, castrating fungal diseases in plants (notably of the genus Microbotryum).

AB  - The golden orchid Cephalanthera falcata is on the verge of extinction from Japan due to foraging by the agromyzid fly Japanagromyza tokunagai and the decline of pollinator bees. Artificial pollination and bagging treatments that exclude foraging flies are promising conservation measures. I examined the rates of fruit set and ripe seed production resulting from the artificial pollination and bagging of C. falcata at one field site in Fukui Prefecture, Japan. I tested 13 individuals over 3 years from 2021 to 2023, classified into three treatment groups: (1) no artificial pollination + no bagging (8 individuals), (2) artificial pollination + no bagging (3 individuals), and (3) artificial pollination + bagging (2 individuals). Artificial pollination resulted in an average of 4 fruits per individual (range: 1-6 fruits), while untreated plants produced 2.1 fruits on average (range: 1-6 fruits; Wilcoxon's rank sum test, p = 0.151). Additionally, the mean damage rate per individual, which was calculated as the proportion of fruits damaged by J. tokunagai out of all fruits, was 0% in the bagged group and 100% in the untreated group (Wilcoxon's rank sum test, p < 0.001). Thus, the bagging of C. falcata produced statistically significant improvements in ripe seed production. However, artificial pollination of C. falcata did not produce statistically significant improvements in fruit set production. My results suggest that fruit set production is not affected by artificial pollination for C. falcata. The damage of C. falcata by J. tokunagai is quite noticeable, with serious implications for the species' ongoing reproduction and survival.

AB  - The expansion of global maritime activities threatens marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Collisions between ships and marine megafauna profoundly impact vulnerable species such as whales, who serve as keystone predators. However, the specific regions most heavily affected by shipping traffic and the multi-species facing collision risk remain poorly understood. Here, we analyzed global shipping data to assess the distribution of areas with high shipping pressure and identify global hotspots for whale-ship collisions. The results reveal that high-pressure habitats are primarily distributed within exclusive economic zones (EEZs), which are generally consistent with the distribution of collision hotspots. High-pressure habitats exhibit significant spatial mismatch: 32.9% of Marine Protected Areas endure high shipping stress and yet occupy merely 1.25% of protected ocean area. Additionally, 25.1% of collision hotspots (top 1% risk) affect four or more whale species, forming critical aggregation in regions like the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Northeast Asian marginal seas. Most of these high-risk areas lack protective measures. These findings offer actionable spatial priorities for implementing targeted conservation strategies, such as the introduction of mandatory speed restrictions and dynamic vessel routing in high-risk, multi-species hotspots. By focusing on critical aggregation areas, these strategies will help mitigate whale mortality and enhance marine biodiversity protection, supporting the sustainable coexistence of maritime activities with vulnerable marine megafauna.

AB  - BackgroundThe cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene is one of the most studied mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes to determine sheep's genetic profile. This study aimed to determine the genetic diversity and relationships of several Indonesian local sheep populations on Java Island, Indonesia, based on the mtDNA Cyt b gene sequences. Blood samples were collected from forty-one individual sheep in seven populations of Indonesia local sheep breeds on Java Island (Priangan = 6, Garut = 6, Batur = 7, Wonosobo = 5, Javanese Thin-Tailed/JTT = 7, Javanese Fat-Tailed/JFT = 5, and Sapudi = 5). DNA extraction was performed on blood samples, and the mtDNA Cyt b gene was amplified using specific primers (Alek-CBF: 5'-CAACCCCACCACTTACAA-3' and Alek-CBR: 5'-CCTTGAGTCTTAGGGAGGTT-3'). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were then sequenced, and data were analyzed using the MEGA version 7.0, DNA SP version 6.0, and NTSYS-pc version 2.11 software.ResultsA total of 1140 bp complete mtDNA Cyt b gene sequences in this study obtained 1134 monomorphic sites (I), six polymorphic sites (V), one segregation site (S), and five parsimony informative sites (P) with a nucleotide diversity (Pi), the average number of nucleotide differences (K), and sequence conservation (SC) were 0.00119, 1.35610, and 0.9947, respectively. There were six haplotypes consisting of two unique haplotypes and four shared haplotypes with a haplotype diversity (Hd) of 0.5415. The genetic distance within and between populations ranged from 0.0000 to 0.0016 and 0.0000 to 0.0020, respectively. Wonosobo, JFT, and Sapudi sheep have the closest relationship, and then these three breeds were close to JTT sheep, followed by Batur, Priangan, and Garut sheep. Two haplogroups have been found based on the Ovine haplogroup clustering. All Wonosobo, JTT, JFT, Sapudi sheep, and most Batur sheep were clustered into haplogroup B. In contrast, Garut sheep were mostly clustered into haplogroup A, while Priangan sheep were clustered into both haplogroups with the same percentage.ConclusionSeven Indonesian local sheep breeds on Java Island have a close relationship clustered into two haplogroups, namely haplogroups A and B. Most Indonesian local sheep breeds on Java Island in this study were clustered into haplogroup B, except for Garut and Priangan sheep.

AB  - Invasive freshwater fish can often have severe negative effects on native fishes in river systems. The interactions between hydrology and habitat variability can mediate the speed and success of individual invasions and the consequent impact on biodiversity. The rivers within Addo Elephant National Park (AENP) in the Eastern Cape, South Africa experience cyclical droughts and wet periods and as a result are naturally episodic. These rivers were recently invaded by three non-native species, the invasive largemouth bass ( Micropterus salmoides ) as well as the extralimital sharptooth catfish ( Clarias gariepinus ) and Mozambique tilapia ( Oreochromis mossambicus ). Monitoring of key sampling sites along two rivers over a 12-year period that included two major droughts revealed unexpected patterns in the spread of these species and their interactions with native fishes. On the Coerney River, C. gariepinus repeatedly invaded and was extirpated from a seasonal reach of the river, wherein O. mossambicus was only occasionally captured. On the Wit River, two apparently independent introductions of M. salmoides in the lower and upper reaches of the river resulted in patchy habitat occupancy over the course of 12 years. While C. gariepinus regularly co-occurred with native species, M. salmoides appeared to locally extirpate the endangered Eastern Cape redfin ( Pseudobarbus afer ). During drought, both species persisted in close but disconnected pools, suggesting that the episodic hydrology and geomorphology of these rivers may offer temporary predation refugia for native species during drought. Conservation implications: Drought in episodic rivers can mitigate against the impact and spread of freshwater invasions within protected areas. Effects of drying on invasion corridors and spatial interactions with native species should be taken into consideration when managing such invasions. Severe droughts also offer an opportunity to actively control invasive species when they are confined to accessible drought refugia within the protected area.

AB  - Climate change is a primary driver of tropical mangroves colonizing temperate salt marshes in the Gulf of Mexico. Studies indicate that threshold temperatures of adult and sapling Avicennia germinans survival range from -7 to -10 degrees C and survival can depend on life history stage during a freeze event. We performed a growth chamber study to explore responses to varying freezing temperature regimes when produced at two different latitudes with varying salinity and nutrient conditions. Propagules were collected from Corpus Christi and South Padre Island, Texas. In Corpus Christi Bay, propagules were harvested from fertilized maternal shrubs (nitrogen, phosphorus, and controls) in an ongoing fertilization experiment (2017 to present). A 2-h hard freeze treatment (-8 degrees C), resulted in 20% survival across latitude and nutrient treatments. The lower latitude propagules, which were harvested from the hypersaline South Padre Island A. germinans, had higher survival rates after -2 degrees C exposure, grew significantly taller as seedlings over 20 weeks, and produced more leaves after -8 degrees C exposure. Propagules from nitrogen-treated shrubs grew taller following -2 degrees C exposure. In all treatments, propagule weight was a significant covariate predictor of seedling height and leaf production. Avicennia germinans populations may not be decimated by a single -8 degrees C freeze, and populations could possibly experience rapid recruitment from surviving propagules after a freeze, leading to local adaptation. Growth benefits from fertilized parent plants indicate that propagules from high nutrient areas may be "hotspots" of future A. germinans expansion.

AB  - The degree of dietary generalization versus specialization exhibited by populations can impact their ability to respond to changing environmental conditions. Naturally shed hair and epidermis are easily collected and may provide a suitable substrate for stable isotope analysis to assess trophic niche specialization. Whether fasting influences the isotopic composition of molted tissues has not been assessed. Here, we gauged the validity of using carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope analysis of molted hair and the outermost epidermis as proxies to study the foraging ecology of southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina at Marion Island in the southern Indian Ocean. Similarity in both bulk tissue (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and amino acid (delta N-15) isotope values of molted tissues and whiskers known to reflect fasting confirmed that physiological changes associated with fasting influenced hair and epidermis isotope values. We recommend caution when using the isotopic composition of molted hair and epidermis to make ecological inferences regarding diet and/or movement. Despite these limitations, molted hair can be used to detect extreme foraging behaviors, which we show using an extensive data set of hair sampled from marked individuals (n = 331) that hauled out on Marion Island during the 2012-2013 annual pelage molt. Other factors, such as ontogenetic shifts in diet and potential environmental (baseline) isotopic variation, also influence hair delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, which complicates the use of isotopic data from molted tissues to assess the temporal consistency of an individuals' isotopic niche.

AB  - Species with fission-fusion social organization, where groups break apart and merge over time, show variable subgroup stability. Plains bison (Bison bison bison (Linnaeus, 1758)), a keystone species in North American grasslands, exhibit fission- fusion dynamics. However, it is unclear whether subgroups are stable over time nor whether they are composed of related individuals. We used fine-scale behavioral observations and movement data from GPS ear tags to construct social networks for two plains bison herds over multiple years at American Prairie in north-central Montana. These herds are semi-free roaming and graze year-round in 32.4 and 111.6 km2 fenced pastures. While the bison in our study did exhibit fission-fusion behavior, we did not observe stable subgroups in time-aggregated social networks constructed over single growing seasons (eigenvector modularity ranged from -0.008 to 0.027). We used Mantel tests to assess the relationships between association strength and relatedness, age, and place of origin. We found that only first-order relatives were more likely to associate, and shared age and place of origin had no significant impact. The observed lack of stable subgroups challenges prevailing assumptions and highlights the need for future research into the mechanisms of fission-fusion dynamics in plains bison and other managed social species.

AB  - A culturally important food fish in Hawai'i, Achilles tang (Acanthurus achilles Shaw), recently experienced sharp declines in biomass, density, and average length in west Hawai'i Island. In December 2022, State resource managers placed a 2-year moratorium on the Achilles tang fishery in west Hawai'i Island so that the cause of the collapse could be explored. The lack of life-history information for Achilles tang from Hawai'i, or elsewhere in its range, has been noted as an impediment to decision-making. Therefore, our objectives were to characterize this population's age, growth, and reproductive biology. In working with community fishers, we collected 363 individuals ranging 69 - 264 mm in fork length (FL) and 0 - 39 years in age based on estimates from otoliths. Achilles tang in Hawai'i exhibit a high growth rate, reaching 138 +/- 11 mm FL (mean +/- SE) in their first year, and exhibit relatively little growth after their second year (< 5 mm yr-1). The majority of males (92.0% of n = 101) and females (73.6% of n = 159) were classified as spawning capable or actively spawning, without annual or lunar periodicity. Our study highlights that the basic biology of Achilles tang poses unique challenges to fisheries managers looking to ensure its sustainable harvest. Future research will aim to characterize the susceptibility of recruits' habitat to local environmental stressors and the relative connectivity of juvenile and adult habitats.

AB  - Understanding how megaherbivores incorporate habitat features into their foraging behavior is key toward understanding how herbivores shape the surrounding landscape. While the role of habitat structure has been studied within the context of predator-prey dynamics and grazing behavior in terrestrial systems, there is a limited understanding of how structure influences megaherbivore grazing in marine ecosystems. To investigate the response of megaherbivores (green turtles) to habitat features, we experimentally introduced structure at two spatial scales in a shallow seagrass meadow in The Bahamas. Turtle density increased 50-fold (to 311 turtles ha(-1)) in response to the structures, and turtles were mainly grazing and resting (low vigilance behavior). This resulted in a grazing patch exceeding the size of the experimental setup (242 m(2)), with reduced seagrass shoot density and aboveground biomass. After structure removal, turtle density decreased and vigilance increased (more browsing and shorter surfacing times), while seagrass within the patch partly recovered. Even at a small scale (9 m(2)), artificial structures altered turtle grazing behavior, resulting in grazing patches in 60% of the plots. Our results demonstrate that marine megaherbivores select habitat features as foraging sites, likely to be a predator refuge, resulting in heterogeneity in seagrass bed structure at the landscape scale.

AB  - Introduction Water depth (WD) and snail abundance (SA) are two key factors affecting the growth of submersed aquatic plants in freshwater lake ecosystems. Changes in WD and SA drive changes in nutrients and other primary producers that may have direct or indirect effects on submersed plant growth, but which factor dominates the impact of both on aquatic plants has not been fully studied.Methods To investigate the dominant factors that influence aquatic plant growth in plateau lakes, a one-year field study was conducted to study the growth of three dominant submersed macrophyte (i.e., Vallisneria natans, Potamogeton maackianus, and Potamogeton lucens) in Erhai Lake.Results The results show that, the biomass of the three dominant plants, P.maackianus, is the highest, followed by P.lucens, and V.natans is the lowest. Meanwhile, periphyton and snails attached to P.maackianus are also the highest. Furthermore, WD had a positive effect on the biomass of two submersed macrophyte species of canopy-type P.maackianus and P.lucens, while it had a negative effect on rosette-type V.natans. Snail directly inhibited periphyton attached on V.natans and thereby increasing the biomass of aquatic plants, but the effect of snails on the biomass of the other two aquatic plants is not through inhibition of periphyton attached to their plants.Discussion The dominant factors affecting the biomass of submersed macrophyte in Erhai Lake were determined, as well as the direct and indirect mechanisms of WD and snails on the biomass of dominant submersed macrophyte. Understanding the mechanisms that dominate aquatic plant change will have implications for lake management and restoration.

AB  - Electric fences are widely used in human-elephant conflict mitigation. However, elephants constantly challenge and overcome fences, which is a growing concern. We studied how elephants crossed the perimeter electric fence around the Udawalawe National Park (UWNP), Sri Lanka. Using camera traps, we monitored 18 fence posts and an open gate in the fence over 605 days from 2016 to 2019. Photographs of 3097 fence crossings were analysed to obtain demographic data for fence crossing elephants, crossing methods, and the daily and seasonal timing of fence crossing. We identified 77 adult males and 12 adult females that crossed the fence, which represent about 17% of the adult elephants in UWNP. Most of the crossings were through the open gate at night. Elephants used a variety of crossing methods, comprised of crossing at the open gate, at previously toppled posts, by crashing through wires and stepping over wires, as well as by using the trunk or forefeet to topple posts. Fence voltage was not a determinant of fence crossing. The frequency and timing of fence crossings varied between locations with later exits and less time spent outside, at crossing points bordering human dominated areas. Our results emphasis on the importance of taking into account the problem solving abilities of elephants in fence design and location, such as energising fence posts and constructing exclosure fences at the boundaries of crop fields and settlements, in employing electric fences to mitigate human-elephant conflict.

AB  - The global transition to renewable energy has large land requirements that can impact local wildlife populations. A clear understanding of whether, or to what degree, wildlife avoid utility-scale solar energy (USSE) development is critical for effective mitigation and planning. This is particularly important for ungulates and other large mammals that cannot move through USSE perimeter fences and instead, rely on design-based mitigation measures (e.g. movement corridors) to minimize impacts and retain connectivity. Using a suite of complementary metrics and fine-scale global positioning system (GPS) data collected 6 months before and 5 years after development, we found multiple lines of evidence that non-migratory pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) avoid USSE. Absent avoidance behaviours, we expected pronghorn use to be similar during pre- and post-construction periods. Yet, we found weekly encounter rates along the USSE perimeter were more than 3x lower after construction. The pattern of less pronghorn use near the USSE extended >1 km. For example, 10% of all pre-construction GPS locations occurred within 0.75 km of the USSE, but the distance needed to contain a similar proportion of locations after construction ranged from 1.65 to 1.75 km. Relatedly, the amount of high-use pronghorn habitat surrounding the USSE declined after development, with the steepest declines (40%-60%) occurring within 1 km of the solar site. When key environmental covariates were accounted for in a resource selection framework, pronghorn preferred to use habitats near the location of the USSE prior to construction, but following construction probability of use was highest at 1.50 km away from the USSE. Practical implication. The direct loss of habitat and reduced connectivity associated with USSE pose serious challenges for ungulate populations. Our results suggest avoidance behaviours could exacerbate the impacts to ungulates through indirect habitat loss and potentially complicate the effectiveness of design-based mitigation measures that assume animals will readily utilize habitats adjacent to USSE.

AB  - The Gerlache Strait is a narrow channel that separates the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) from the Palmer Archipelago. This area is characterized by the presence of interconnected fjords, bays, islands, and channels that serve as a refuge for megafauna during summer. Through the framework of FjordPhyto - a citizen science collaboration with the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) vessels - we assessed phytoplankton biomass and composition in surface waters of six under-explored nearshore areas connected to the Gerlache Strait (between 64 degrees and 65 degrees S) during three consecutive seasons, from November to March (2016-2019). During the first two seasons, we found significant differences in the phytoplankton community distribution and successional patterns to the north and south of the sampling area; the greatest differences were evidenced mainly in the months of high biomass, December and January. During December, cryptophytes bloomed in the north, while microplanktonic diatoms dominated in the south, and during January, small centric diatoms dominated in the north, while prasinophytes bloomed in the south. This spatial distinction in phytoplankton communities were mainly associated with the occurrence of a surface thermal front in the Gerlache Strait around 64.5 degrees S. The presence of the front separating warm waters to the north and colder waters to the south, during the months of December to February, was confirmed by the analysis of 10 years of remote sensing data. By contrast, during the third season, low biomass prevailed, and no differences in the phytoplankton composition between the north and south areas were observed. The third season was the coldest of the series, with smaller differences in water temperature north and south of the usual front location. This study shows for the first time a complete overview of the phytoplankton composition throughout the entire growth season (November through March) in the nearshore areas of the WAP between 64 degrees and 65 degrees S. The results of this work contribute to the understanding of the phytoplankton community in relation to small scale physical features during the Antarctic austral summer.

AB  - Extreme climatic events (ECEs) and predator removal represent some of the most widespread stressors to ecosystems. Though species interactions can alter ecological effects of climate change (and vice versa), it is less understood whether, when and how predator removal can interact with ECEs to exacerbate their effects. Understanding the circumstances under which such interactions might occur is critical because predator loss is widespread and ECEs can generate rapid phase shifts in ecosystems which can ultimately lead to tropicalization.
   Our goal was to determine whether loss of predation risk may be an important mechanism governing ecosystem responses to extreme events, and whether the effects of such events, such as tropicalization, can occur even when species range shifts do not. Specifically, our goal was to experimentally simulate the loss of an apex predator, the tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier effects on a recently damaged seagrass ecosystem of Shark Bay, Australia by applying documented changes to risk-sensitive grazing of dugong Dugong dugon herbivores.
   Using a 16-month-field experiment established in recently disturbed seagrass meadows, we used previous estimates of risk-sensitive dugong foraging behaviour to simulate altered risk-sensitive foraging densities and strategies of dugongs consistent with apex predator loss, and tracked seagrass responses to the simulated grazing.
   Grazing treatments targeted and removed tropical seagrasses, which declined. However, like in other mixed-bed habitats where dugongs forage, treatments also incidentally accelerated temperate seagrass losses, revealing that herbivore behavioural changes in response to predator loss can exacerbate ECE and promote tropicalization, even without range expansions or introductions of novel species.
   Our results suggest that changes to herbivore behaviours triggered by loss of predation risk can undermine ecological resilience to ECEs, particularly where long-lived herbivores are abundant. By implication, ongoing losses of apex predators may combine with increasingly frequent ECEs to amplify climate change impacts across diverse ecosystems and large spatial scales.

AB  - The application of livestock manure and aquaculture wastewater into agricultural soil introduces animal manurederived colloids into the environment. These manure-derived colloids generally contain different organic matter components and may facilitate nanoparticle transport to the subsurface. This study investigated the interaction between manure-derived colloids (cow and pig manures) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles at neutral pH. The effect of this interaction on the stability, aggregation, and transport of TiO2 in a saturated porous media was studied. Our study found that cow manure-derived colloids have many humic-like substances, and pig manure-derived colloids contain many protein components and some humic-like substances. The interactions of different manure-derived colloids with TiO2 can affect the zeta-potential and aggregation status of TiO2 in the aqueous system. The results showed that cow manure-derived colloids slightly increased the TiO2 transport due to electrostatic repulsion, while pig manure-derived colloids substantially increased the TiO2 mobility in porous media because of both electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance. Since both animal manure and TiO2 are ubiquitously present in the natural environment, manure-derived colloids can change the surface properties of TiO2 and facilitate TiO2 transport in the subsurface.

AB  - Knowledge of the distribution and residency of pelagic marine megafauna, particularly deep-diving species, is scarce due to their high mobility over difficult-to-access oceanic areas and long periods underwater. However, the threatened status of many of these species, such as the sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus, increases the need to obtain quantitative data to support conservation measures. In the warm temperate waters of Macaronesia (Eastern North Atlantic), sperm whales occur year-round in a set of island systems (the Azores, Madeira, and the Canaries), mainly in social groups of females and juveniles with the occasional visits of mature males. Although it is known that they perform inter-archipelago movements, information on site fidelity and residency times is still scarce. Here, based on photographic-identification data, site fidelity and residency times of sperm whales were estimated for subareas of the Azores and the Madeira archipelagos, with a preliminary assessment for a subarea of the Canaries. The Azores and Madeira subareas presented similar proportions of individuals with recaptures (similar to 25%), mainly inter-annual, while in the subarea of the Canaries, only <10% of the individuals were recaptured. Standardized Site Fidelity Indexes showed very low values (<0.01) for both the Azores and Madeira subareas. Lagged identification rates based on models including emigration and reimmigration estimated that an average of 44.8 individuals (SE=4.9) spent 12.9 days (SE=1.5) in the Azores before leaving for 99.1 days (SE=12.5), while 8.4 individuals (SE=16.1) spent 0.8 day (SE=6.6) in Madeira before leaving for 8.6 days (SE=6.9), with a very low mortality rate. This study i) indicates a degree of residency of about 1/4 of the identified individuals for the Azores and Madeira subareas and ii) supports that these oceanic archipelagos constitute an important habitat for a Vulnerable species in the Atlantic. Moreover, it also highlights the importance of combining data from opportunistic and dedicated surveys and joint national and international efforts toward the conservation of marine megafauna.

AB  - The rapid loss of arctic sea ice is forcing a larger proportion of the Southern Beaufort Sea polar bear (Ursus maritimus) population to spend more time on land, increasing chances of negative interactions between people and bears. In the United States, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) protects polar bears from incidental disturbance from human activities. For the remote and roadless areas of northern Alaska, USA, effective management of small aircraft activity is necessary to limit disturbance, but effects of overflights on polar bear behavior are largely unknown. During 2021 and 2022, we intentionally exposed polar bears (n = 115) to systematic aircraft activity (helicopter, fixed-wing) until we observed a disruption of behavior that qualified as a level B take response (e.g., abrupt change in activity or movement) under the MMPA. We used a Bayesian logistic regression to determine what factors influence and can be used to predict when a polar bear will exhibit a level B take response and estimate the probability of an aircraft eliciting a level B take response at different altitudes above the polar bear. Aircraft type, flight altitude, landscape (barrier islands vs. mainland), and bear behavior (active vs. inactive) upon initial aircraft encounter were all important predictors of take. Probability of take rapidly increased with a decrease in flight altitude starting at 450 m for helicopter and 300 m for fixed-wing aircraft. Active (e.g., standing, walking) polar bears on barrier-island landscapes were more likely to experience take than inactive (e.g., bedded) bears on mainland landscapes. Our findings can help with assessments and management plans by quantifying disturbance to polar bears from current and future human activity that involves aircraft use.

AB  - When hydrothermal activity ceases at black-smoker chimneys on mid-ocean ridges, populations of associated invertebrates hosting chemoautotrophic endosymbionts decline and then disappear, but the chimneys can persist on the seabed as relicts. Suspension-feeding brisingid seastars colonize hydrothermally inactive (relict) chimneys on the East Pacific Rise (EPR), though their distribution relative to available hard substrata and proximity to hydrothermal activity is poorly documented. In this study, brisingid abundance on sulfide and basalt substrata was assessed along an similar to 3,700 m ROV Jason II transect at the summit of Pito Seamount (SE Pacific; similar to 2,275 m). Brisingids were non-randomly distributed, with highest densities (up to similar to 300 m(-2)) on relict sulfides chimneys near active black smokers. Brisingids were relatively uncommon on basalt substrata, and absent on black smokers. We infer that both relict sulfide structures and proximity to black smokers play key roles in the maintenance of dense brisingid populations on Pito Seamount and in similar environments on the EPR. Our observations suggest that experimental introduction of "artificial" relict chimneys providing microtopographic relief could test whether such an approach might mitigate potential impacts of mineral extraction on populations of suspension-feeding invertebrates.

AB  - Extra-limital sightings of seals breeding on the Antarctic pack- and fast ice and on sub-Antarctic and temperate islands of the South Atlantic Ocean are summarised. Particular life history events of four vagrant seal species that have turned up on Mid-Atlantic Ridge islands are presented, and the likely arrival of a further three vagrant seal species is speculated upon. The setting up and/or expansion of a recording system underpinned by an appropriate sighting protocol for vagrant seals in which citizen scientists can participate is advanced. Determination of whether range contractions/expansions of seals in the South Atlantic are taking place reflects on the status of the source population(s). Seal vagrancy may conceivably also be involved in the spread of viral diseases such as highly pathogenic avian influenza and rabies. Insights gained through extra-limital sightings of seals may assist with the establishment of conservation strategies.

AB  - In the late 10th century, the Norse established settlements in Greenland that lasted until the mid-15th century, driven by more than just climatic factors. These settlers introduced agropastoral practices and engaged in longdistance trade, especially in the highly prized walrus ivory. The Eastern Settlement (Eystribyggd), at 60 degrees N, proved to be the largest and best studied settlement, in contrast to the smaller Western Settlement (Vestribyggd) at 64 degrees N, particularly in the Kapisillit area. The Western Settlement was likely abandoned earlier than the Eastern Settlement, although the exact timing remains debated. The harsher climatic conditions may have pushed the western settlers towards a subsistence strategy focused, in addition to farming activities, on hunting and fishing. High-resolution multi-proxy analyses of lake sediments from Lake Itinera and Lake Pingu at Kapisillit, only 2 km away from the nearest Norse ruins, reveal subtle environmental changes and fire activity between 1000 and 1200 CE. These changes are characterised by a slight clearing of scrubland, including willows and alders, and an increased spread of herbaceous vegetation. Although the presence of coprophilous fungal spores suggests some herbivore activity, the data do not indicate significant grazing pressure. Instead, the declining values of these spores may reflect a decline in domesticated animals or increased hunting of wild herbivores, such as caribou, towards the end of the settlement period. After the mid-13th century, our results suggest a decrease in human influence, coinciding with the onset of the Little Ice Age. However, the reasons for the eventual abandonment of the Western Settlement remain unclear. This study provides evidence from pollen data and records of fire activity and contributes to our understanding of the complex interactions between societies and the environment, highlighting grazing and hunting pressure as key factors in vegetation change at the Western Settlement. The results highlight the complexity of interpreting environmental data, particularly in distinguishing between anthropogenic impacts and natural variability during the Norse period.

AB  - Understanding ontogenetic differences in plant defenses and herbivory damage is crucial for obtaining a better understanding of plant life-history strategies, community assembly, and dynamics. Although many studies have compared plant defenses or herbivory damage between ontogenetic stages (e.g. sapling vs. adult), how the effects of plant characteristics on leaf herbivory damage change during plant ontogeny has rarely been examined across species or in a species-rich natural community. To elucidate the effects of plant characteristics, we compared the relationships of leaf herbivory by insects with stem density, plant size, and leaf traits between saplings and adults for almost all co-occurring woody species (56 species, ranging from rare to abundant) in a Japanese temperate forest. In most species, adults were larger, fewer in number, and had leaf traits that were potentially less favorable to herbivores (e.g. stronger, or with more phenolics). In contrast, we observed species-specific directions of changes in herbivory damage between adults and saplings with plant phylogeny or density having no clear effect. The relationships between some plant traits and herbivory damage were ontogeny dependent, indicating a shift from chemical to physical defense as plants mature, although most of the species characteristics studied were highly correlated between stages. Such ontogeny-dependent relationships between plant traits and herbivory damage could cause variation in the ontogenetic changes in herbivory damage among species depending on the value of plant traits. Moreover, the direction and magnitude of the effects of ontogenetic differences in species traits on the ontogenetic differences in herbivory damage varied depending on the traits. Together, these factors could have caused the observed ontogenetic changes in herbivory damage among species. Synthesis. Our study demonstrated how relationships between plant characteristics and herbivory damage can change ontogenetically across many coexisting woody species in a forest community, suggesting that plant traits may perform different functions related to herbivory at different ontogenetic stages. This has rarely been considered in previous dualistic comparisons of individual traits and herbivory damage between ontogenetic stages, and it is vital for understanding plant life-history strategies across stages in relationships with herbivores in natural communities.

AB  - Simple Summary: The aim of this study was to investigate the adaptability of ten recently introduced European bison (Bison bonasus) in Lille Vildmose. Populations from Bornholm, Denmark, and Bialowie.za Forest, Poland, were used as a reference. We investigated the adaptability of the European bison through analysis of their dietary diversity and parasitic load during twelve months after translocation. From March 2021 to February 2022, fecal samples were collected from the herds. In Lille Vildmose, a significant difference in egg per gram feces (EPG) was observed for June when compared to the months during autumn and winter (October-February). Metabarcoding of 63 bison dung samples collected during March-September in Lille Vildmose identified eight species of nematodes in the gastrointestinal tract of the European bison, with Haemonchus contortus being most frequently observed. Furthermore, 79 plant taxa were identified in the diet of the European bison. The broadest diet was observed in March suggesting that the bison quickly adapted to their new habitat. Additionally, the results suggested a seasonal shift in their diet, with this being most apparent from March to April.
   For the purpose of nature management and species conservation, European bison (Bison bonasus) are being increasingly reintroduced into nature reserves across Europe. The aim of this study was to investigate European bison's adaptability to new areas through the study of their parasite-EPG (eggs per gram feces) and dietary diversity during twelve months after translocation. We compared the parasite-EPG from introduced European bison in Lille Vildmose, Denmark, with the parasite-EPG from populations from Bornholm, Denmark, and Bialowiez. a Forest, Poland. From March 2021 to February 2022, fecal samples were collected from three populations. Samples from Lille Vildmose were examined through flotation, sedimentation, the Baermann technique, and nanopore sequencing. Fecal samples from Bornholm and Bialowie.za were examined through flotation and sedimentation. Nanopore sequencing of DNA from 63 European bison's fecal samples collected during March-September in Lille Vildmose identified 8 species of nematodes within the digestive tract of the European bison, with Haemonchus contortus being the most frequently observed. In Lille Vildmose, a significantly higher excretion of nematode-EPG was observed during the summer period than in the spring, autumn, and winter. In addition, monthly differences in the excretion of nematode eggs were found, with this being significantly higher in June than in the months during autumn and winter (October-February). Significant differences in the nematode-EPG were only found between the excretion of nematode eggs in Bialowie.za Forest when compared to that of Lille Vildmose, with significantly higher excretion in Lille Vildmose (October-November). The results indicate that the development rates for nematodes may be affected by changes in temperature, with increasing temperatures speeding up their development time. Independent of this study design, wildlife vets together with the gamekeepers managing the herd found it necessary to treat the herd with antiparasitics for practical and animal welfare reasons in relation to translocation. Furthermore, 79 plant taxa were identified in the diet of the European bison. The broadest diet was observed in March suggesting that the European bison quickly adapted to their new habitat. The results suggest a seasonal shift in their diet, with this being most apparent from March to April.

AB  - The Antarctic is particularly sensitive to mercury (Hg) pollution and even low levels of Hg may cause significant damage in this fragile environment. The aim of this study was to investigate routes of mercury and methyl-mercury (MeHg) elimination by animals inhabiting the maritime Antarctic. The results showed that organisms at the highest trophic level (elephant seal) have the highest concentrations of THg and MeHg in both excrement and fur samples. Interspecies differences in mercury levels were observed in materials sourced from penguins of the genus Pysgocelis. 13C and 15N values confirmed differences in the diets and foraging areas, which may affect Hg concentration in the tissues we analyzed. Time variations in THg and MeHg concentrations were observed in the excrement of the penguin species, which may be due to periods of fasting and intense feeding closely related to egg laying and moulting stages.

AB  - Eccrinales are protists of the class Mesomycetozoea exclusively found in the digestive tract of marine, freshwater and terrestrial arthropods. Isopods are the only terrestrial crustaceans from which eccrinids have been reported. Among brachyuran crabs, eccrinids were exclusively reported in grapsid and ocypodid crabs, with a percentage of occurrence ranging from 5% to 100% in the respective species. The eccrinid Enteromyces callianassae Lichtwardt, 1961 has been found in the guts of various decapod crustacean species in marine habitats and intertidal mud or sand flats in Chile, France, Japan and the USA. Semi-terrestrial species of Leptuca and Minuca were the most terrestrial crabs in which E. callianassae has been observed. Here we report the presence of E. callianassae in stomachs of the land crab Gecarcinus lateralis. These are the first observations of protists in gecarcinid crabs, which are regarded as the most terrestrial brachyuran crabs. The presence of E. callianassae in 11% of 74 examined stomachs from males and females of G. lateralis from three locations in Costa Rica suggests that the occurence of E. callianassae in these crabs is a relatively widespread phenomenon. Considering that these highly terrestrial crabs are important herbivores on island and continental landscapes, the presence of eccrinids in the stomachs of these crabs may have important implications for the carbon cycling in coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms governing biological invasions has implications for population dynamics, biodiversity, and community assembly. The enemy escape hypothesis posits that escape from enemies such as herbivores and predators that were limiting in the native range helps explain rapid spread in the introduced range. While the enemy escape hypothesis has been widely tested aboveground, data limitations have prevented comparisons of belowground mechanisms for invasive and noninvasive introduced species, which limits our understanding of why only some introduced species become invasive. We assessed the role of soil biota in driving plant invasions in a phylogenetic meta-analysis, incorporating phylogeny in the error structure of the models, and comparing live and sterilized conditioned soils. We found 29 studies and 396 effect size estimates across 103 species that compared live and sterilized soils. We found general positive effects of soil biota for plants (0.099, 95% CI = 0.0266, 0.1714), consistent with a role of soil mutualists. The effect size of soil biota among invaders was 3.2x higher than for natives, the strength of effects was weaker for older conditioning species with a longer introduced history, and enemy escape was stronger for distant relatives. In addition, invasive species had a weaker allocation tradeoff than natives. By demonstrating that the net effect of soil biota is more positive for invasive than native and noninvasive introduced species, weakens over time since introduction, and strengthens as phylogenetic distance increasing, we provide mechanistic insights into the considerable role of soil biota in biological invasions, consistent with the predictions of the enemy escape hypothesis.

AB  - Evaluating reintroduction success is fundamental to wildlife management and conservation. Movement affects animal fitness and survival and is the first response of reintroduced animals, making it an excellent indicator of reintroduction success. However, there is limited information on the early post-release movement of reintroduced animals. Here, we addressed this important issue by studying the post-release behaviour of the critically endangered black rhinoceros, Diceros bicornis minor, reintroduced to the Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe, in 2021. We used daytime sighting data collected from 21 rhinoceros for 1.5 years to investigate survival and reproduction, movement patterns and habitat selection after release. We examine how sex, age and different release sites affect the short-term movement behaviour and habitat selection of black rhinos. Rhinos showed progressive and consistent changes in movement patterns and habitat selection, shifting from large-scale movements during the early stages of release to smaller-scale movements after home ranges were established. We found that rhinos released in the large area had larger activity areas with less overlap between individuals and moved further away from the release site (less fidelity to the release site) than the individuals released in the smaller area. These findings confirm the great capacity of black rhinos to adapt to the environment, occupying large ranges when given the opportunity, but populations with smaller ranges can also be viable. Based on our study and a literature review, we stress the importance of longterm monitoring and believe that reserve size, rhino density, fencing, food and water availability, familiarity between conspecifics and human disturbance are key factors in the successful establishment of a rhino population that should be considered in future reintroductions. Finally, the high survival and birth rates in the first 1.5 years after reintroduction, together with most rhinos having established their home range, suggest a successful reintroduction in the short term.

AB  - Sufficient genetic variation is vital for the long-term survival of a population. The adaptive potential and reproductive fitness of a population is generally enhanced by greater levels of genetic diversity, while loss of genetic variation in small populations may increase extinction risk due to disease susceptibility and decreased reproductive fitness. Determining levels of genetic diversity in threatened species can, therefore, help inform conservation strategies. The Chinese water deer (Hydropotes inermis) is classified as Vulnerable in its native range on the IUCN Red List, and populations in Korea and mainland China have declined drastically in recent years. However, the species was introduced to Europe about a century ago and populations there now make up over 40% of global numbers. To infer the population genetic structure and genetic diversity of Chinese water deer both in their native China and in populations introduced to the UK and France, variation in mitochondrial DNA was investigated for over 100 individuals (92 cytochrome b and 106 control region sequences). Our results reveal lower levels of genetic diversity in the British populations, differentiation between native and introduced populations, and that the source population of British deer is likely to be extinct. Recommendations are made for the conservation of populations.

AB  - Following its eradication from the USA, the cattle fever tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Canestrini), a vector of bovine babesiosis, has made episodic incursions into, and sometimes beyond, an established barrier zone separating tick-free from endemic areas. In large part the incursions involve hosting and transport by wild ungulates, particularly deer and antelope. One approach to disinfest ticks from wild hosts is with food baits medicated to stop parasites. The approach has had mixed success due to factors that have been previously identified with supplemental feeding of wildlife especially competition for the bait, social dominance behavior, and the availability of alternative food sources. Given that not all of the target hosts will intake a therapeutic dose of the medication (ivermectin) at all seasons of the year, an open question is whether the approach is efficacious as a stand-alone treatment or even as part of an integrated program. As detailed in the present study an intensive effort was successful in eradicating a local outbreak of fever ticks.

AB  - The red deer Cervus elephus has been a common species in Italy until the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, when its distribution range started to considerably decrease, due to gradual deforestation and hunting pressure. Afterwards, the red deer has been reintroduced to many regions of the world, including Italy. In the Italian Apennines, the Acquerino-Cantagallo Natural Reserve (ACQUERINO) hosts one of the largest peninsular red deer populations, originated from a series of successful reintroductions. In this study, we meant to detect the level of genetic variability of Acquerino-Cantagallo Natural Reserve deer population and to investigate the genetic relationships with the other Italian and European populations. We identified five mitochondrial DNA control region (D-loop) haplotypes, four falling in lineage A and one falling in lineage C, derived from at least two maternal lineages, confirming that ACQUERINO population should be the result of multiple reintroductions. Haplotype diversity (H = 0.50) and nucleotide (pi = 0.004) diversity were low, but included into the deer range values. ACQUERINO population showed low levels of genetic diversity when compared to other European and Mediterranean populations, confirming that this expanding population may have been generated from a low number of founders.

AB  - The massive die-off of the sea urchin Diadema antillarum in 1983-1984 is one the main reasons for low coral recruitment and little coral recovery in the Caribbean. As the natural recovery of D. antillarum is slow to non-existent, multiple restoration studies have been attempted. There are currently three different approaches to obtain individuals for restocking: the translocation of wild-collected juveniles or adults, lab-reared juveniles cultured from wild-collected settlers, or lab-reared juveniles cultured from gametes. All three methods are costly and can only be applied on a relatively small scale. We here propose a fourth, new, approach, which we term assisted natural recovery (ANR) of D. antillarum populations. ANR, a concept already applied in terrestrial restoration to restore forests and grasslands, can accelerate succession by removing barriers to natural recovery. In this study, performed on the Dutch Caribbean island of Saba, suitable settlement substrate was provided in the form of bio ball streamers that were attached to the reef shortly before the settlement season. At the end of the experiment, reefs with streamers had significantly higher D. antillarum recruit densities than control reefs without additional settlement substrate, indicating that the lack of settlement substrate is an important factor constraining natural recovery. However, D. antillarum recruit abundance was low compared to the measured settlement rates, possibly due to low post-settlement survival. The size distribution of recruits showed that recruits almost never became larger than 20 mm, which is likely due to predation. We conclude that, next to low settlement availability, low post-settlement survival and high predation on recruits also constrain the natural recovery of D. antillarum populations on Saba. To improve the survival of settlers till adults, we propose to 1) reduce predation on settlers by using bio balls or other substrates that can provide shelter to larger individuals and 2) optimize the reef habitat by removing macroalgae, either manually or by facilitating other herbivores. To improve the survival of recruits, we suggest to 1) choose sites with a known lower predation density or 2) protect recruits with a corral around the reef underneath the streamers. The combination of these measures could improve prospects for ANR, and we expect this new approach can contribute to the recovery of D. antillarum populations in the future.

AB  - The consequences of non-native species invasion may depend on the characteristics of the invaded ecosystem, such as abiotic environmental conditions and biological community structure. Invasive herbivores can have a substantial adverse impact on the abundance of submerged macrophytes and trigger declines in water quality. Although previous research has posited that shallow lakes with higher nutrient conditions might exhibit greater susceptibility to non-native herbivores, empirical support for this claim remains limited. In this study, we employed 24 mesocosms to simulate shallow water ecosystems, with the primary objective of assessing the influence of invasive herbivorous apple snails (Pomacea canaliculata) on submerged macrophyte and phytoplankton abundance under two distinct nutrient conditions. Our findings indicate that moderate nutrient enrichment alone promoted submerged macrophyte growth, leading to a 156% increase in total biomass in the nutrient-enriched treatment compared to the control (low-nutrient conditions without apple snails). However, the introduction of apple snails caused a significant reduction in submerged macrophyte biomass in both nutrient conditions, approximately 100% loss in low-nutrient conditions and a roughly 50% loss in moderately nutrient-enriched conditions. Additionally, the presence of apple snails slightly increased phytoplankton abundance (similar to 57 chl-a mu g/l for phytoplankton and similar to 2 mu g/l chl-a for cyanobacteria) under low-nutrient conditions, while triggering a shift to a turbid state dominated by planktonic algae (similar to 270 chl-a mu g/l for phytoplankton and similar to 36 mu g/l chl-a for cyanobacteria) under moderately nutrient-enriched conditions. These results emphasize the need for effective management strategies to control invasive herbivores and decrease nutrient inputs.

AB  - It has long been hypothesised that introduced species can evolve to become better competitors, which in turn will enable some of them to become invasive. The evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis (EICA) gives a possible answer for why some introduced plants become invasive by stating that they can escape natural coevolved enemies (pests, pathogens and herbivores) in their new environment, thus allowing them to shift resource allocation from producing expensive chemical defences, towards a higher growth rate and competitive ability. In order to test if there is evidence for increased competitive ability in introduced populations, we examined the performance of three Rumex species (R. obtusifolius, R. crispus and R. conglomeratus, Polygonaceae) from their native (United Kingdom) and introduced ranges (New Zealand), when grown alone and in competition with a conspecific from the same or a different provenance. Based on the predictions of EICA, we hypothesised that plants from the introduced provenance would: (i) have a faster growth rate and a larger biomass at harvest; and (ii) would perform better in competition with a conspecific from the native provenance than one from the introduced provenance. Intraspecific competition reduced biomass by as much as 50%. However, contrary to expectations, we found no difference between the performance of plants from native and introduced provenances when grown in direct competition with each other. Plant performance when grown with a conspecific from the same provenance was similar to performance when paired with one from a different provenance, showing that there was no provenance effect. These results were consistent for all three Rumex species. Our findings contradict the predictions of the EICA hypothesis suggesting that other factors are needed to explain the success of Rumex species in New Zealand.

AB  - Sodium (Na) plays a critical role in the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. In Na-poor regions, plant consumers may experience Na deficiency and adapt by seeking supplementary Na resources. This can markedly impact animal behavior, space-use, and co-existence, with concomitant impacts on ecosystems. Many studies have noted that Na-seeking behaviors, such as soil consumption from mineral licks, are predominately observed for larger-bodied herbivores. However, the mechanisms that drive interspecific variation in Na deficiency and mineral lick use remain poorly understood. Here, we examine whether allometric scaling of Na requirements can explain variation in mineral lick use by herbivorous and omnivorous mammals. We 1) collated data from published literature to derive an allometric scaling of Na requirements in mammals, 2) compared predicted Na requirements to estimated Na intake of mammal communities in three globally distant sites: the Peruvian Amazon, Kalahari Desert, and Malaysian Borneo and 3) examined the relationship between predicted Na deficiency and mineral lick use utilizing camera-trap and mammal abundance data at each site. We found that minimum daily Na maintenance requirements in mammals scaled allometrically at a higher factor (BM0.91 (CI: 0.80-1.0)) than that of food and water Na intake (BM0.71-0.79), indicating that larger species may be more susceptible to Na limitation. This aligned with a positive association between mineral lick use and body mass (BM), as well as Na deficiency, by species at all sites, and increased artificial salt and mineral lick consumption by larger-bodied mammals in the Kalahari. Our results suggest that larger herbivores may be more sensitive to anthropogenic impacts to Na availability, which may alter their functional roles in ecosystems, particularly in Na-poor regions. Further research is needed to explore the consequences of changing Na availability on animals and ecosystems, as well as advance our understanding of Na physiology in mammals.

AB  - Context. Across Australia, feral cat (Fells catus) control and eradication programs are conducted to conserve threatened and vulnerable species. Controlling feral cats effectively at a landscape scale, particularly in remote woodland habitats, remains a significant challenge. Unfortunately, some standard feral cat control methods, such as shooting and cage trapping, require road access. Poison baiting is one of the few methods available to control feral cat populations in remote and inaccessable areas. Aims. We aimed to examine the impact of a Curiosity (R) (Scientec Research PTY LTD, Melbourne, Australia) baiting program on the feral cat population found in continuous woodland habitat of the Dudley Peninsula, on Kangaroo Island, South Australia. Methods. The density of cats was monitored using camera traps set up across both treatment and control sites using a before-after control-impact approach. Feral cat density was calculated using a spatially explicit capture-recapture framework. In addition, 14 feral cats were GPS collared at the treatment site, and their status and location, before and after baiting, was monitored. Key results. At the treatment site after baiting, feral cat density fell from 1.18 +/- 0.51 to 0.58 +/- 0.22 cats km(-2). In total, 14 feral cats were GPS collared, and of those, eight were detected within the treatment zone during and after bait deployment. Six of those eight cats died shortly after baiting, likely from bait consumption. A new individual cat was detected in the treatment zone within 10 days of baiting, and within 20 days, four new individuals were detected. Both before and after baiting, the number of feral cat detections was highest on roads, suggesting cat recolonisation of baited areas may be assisted by roads. Conclusions. Curiosity baiting was found to be an effective method for reducing the density of feral cats in continuous woodland habitats of Kangaroo Island. Roads may act as access routes aiding cat recolonisation. Implications. Curiosity baiting programs on Kangaroo Island (and elsewhere) would benefit from incorporating follow-up control, particularly along roads, to target feral cats re-colonising the area.

AB  - The island syndrome hypothesis (ISH) stipulates that, as a result of local selection pressures and restricted gene flow, individuals from island populations should differ from individuals within mainland populations. Specifically, island populations are predicted to contain individuals that are larger, less aggressive, more sociable, and that invest more in their offspring. To date, tests of the ISH have mainly compared oceanic islands to continental sites, and rarely smaller spatial scales such as inland watersheds. Here, using a novel set of genome-wide SNP markers in wild deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) we conducted a genomic assessment of predictions underlying the ISH in an inland riverine island system: analysing island-mainland population structure, and quantifying heritability of phenotypes thought to underlie the ISH. We found clear genomic differentiation between the island and mainland populations and moderate to high marker-based heritability estimates for overall variation in traits previously found to differ in line with the ISH between mainland and island locations. F-ST outlier analyses highlighted 12 loci associated with differentiation between mainland and island populations. Together these results suggest that the island populations examined are on independent evolutionary trajectories, the traits considered have a genetic basis (rather than phenotypic variation being solely due to phenotypic plasticity). Coupled with the previous results showing significant phenotypic differentiation between the island and mainland groups in this system, this study suggests that the ISH can hold even on a small spatial scale.

AB  - Species that depend on anthropogenic waste for food can remove pathogens that pose health risks to humans and livestock, thereby saving lives and money. Quantifying these benefits is rare, yet can lead to innovative conservation solutions. To assess these benefits, we examined the feeding ecology and population size of peri-urban spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta in Mekelle, Ethiopia. We integrated these field data into a disease transmission model to predict: (a) the number of anthrax and bovine tuberculosis (bTB) infections arising in humans and livestock from infected carcass waste and (b) the costs associated with treating these infections and losing livestock. We compared these public health and economic outcomes under two scenarios: (a) hyenas are present and (b) the counterfactual, hyenas are absent. We estimated that hyenas annually remove 4.2% (207 tonnes) of the total carcass waste disposed of by residents and businesses in Mekelle. Furthermore, the scavenging behaviour of hyenas annually prevents five infections of anthrax and bTB in humans, and 140 infections in cattle, sheep and goats. This disease control service potentially saves USD 52,165 due to the treatment costs and livestock loss avoided. Synthesis and applications. This human-hyena interaction in Ethiopia is evidence that large carnivores can contribute to human health and economy. To retain these benefits and maintain tolerance of hyenas, we recommend introducing education programmes to promote safe outdoor behaviour around hyenas, training watchdogs to alert residents of hyena presence, constructing bomas to protect livestock from hyena attacks, and preserving the hyenas' access to carcass waste to reduce their dependency on livestock predation. With humans and carnivores coming more frequently into contact, understanding and communicating how these species can benefit humanity will be critical to motivating human-carnivore coexistence worldwide.

AB  - BackgroundThe family Synallactidae comprises mostly deep-sea forms and is the least-studied largetaxon amongst deep-sea cucumbers. They are part of the abyssal megafauna and play animportant role in modifying the sediment landscape and structuring the communities thatlive within it. The family embraces the genus Synallactes, which contains approximatelytwenty-five species from the Pacific, Atlantic (six species), Indian (seven species) andAntarctic Oceans (one species). New informationSynallactes mcdanieli sp. nov. is described from the Northeast Pacific, Knight Inlet, BritishColumbia, Canada to Kodiak Island, Gulf of Alaska, USA, at depths from 21 to 438 m. Thisnew species is unique amongst the species of the genus Synallactes because of thenumber and arrangement of dorsal papillae, number of Polian vesicles, together with theentire ossicle arrangement. In addition, this species has the shallowest bathymetricdistribution ever recorded for this genus.

AB  - The attitudes of community members living around protected areas are an important and often overlooked consideration for effective conservation strategies. Around Kibale National Park (KNP) in western Uganda, communities regularly face the threat of crop destruction from wildlife, including from a variety of endangered species, such as African elephants (Loxodonta africana), common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus tephrosceles), as well as other nonhuman primates, including olive baboons (Papio anubis). These frequent negative interactions with wildlife lead many community members to resent the park and the animals that live within it. To mitigate these issues, community members around KNP partnered with researchers to start a participatory action research project to reduce human-wildlife interactions. The project tested four sustainable human-wildlife conflict mitigation strategies: digging and maintaining trenches around the park border, installing beehive fences in swampy areas where trenches could not be dug, planting tea as a buffer, and growing garlic as a cash crop. These physical exclusion methods and agriculture-based deterrents aimed to reduce crop destruction by wild animals and improve conditions for humans and wildlife alike. We conducted oral surveys with members of participating communities and a nonparticipating community that border KNP to determine the impact of these sustainable human-wildlife conflict mitigation strategies on attitudes toward KNP, wildlife officials, and animal species in and around KNP. We found that there is a positive correlation between participation in the project and perceived benefits of living near KNP. We also found that respondents who participated in the project reported more positive feelings about the Uganda Wildlife Authority, the organization that oversees KNP. This research will help inform future conservation initiatives around KNP and other areas where humans and animals face conflict through crop damage.

AB  - Elasmobranchs are crucial for comparative studies of evolution, as they belong to the most ancient vertebrate lineages that survived numerous extinction events and persist until today. The immunoglobulin new antigen receptor (IgNAR) found in sharks and heavy-chain-only antibody (HCAb) found in camelidae are products of convergent evolution. Although it was previously believed that IgNAR emerged 220 million years ago, before the divergence of sharks and skates, there is limited evidence to support this. In this study, we provide data supporting the existence of IgNAR in the ocellate spot skate (Okamejei kenojei) mononuclear cell transcriptome and peripheral blood serum. Additionally, we characterize the germline gene configuration of the ocellate spot skate IgNAR V domain. The ocellate spot skate IgNAR structure prediction and VNAR crystal structure exhibit high similarity to their shark counterparts. These data strongly suggest that IgNAR in both sharks and skates share a common ancestor. Sequencing of the ocellate spot skate VNAR repertoire provided crucial data for further understanding of the IgNAR generation. Notably, we discovered that approximately 99% of the ocellate spot skate VNARs belonged to type IV. This represents an exceptionally high proportion of type IV within the VNAR repertoire, which has not been documented in previously studied elasmobranchs. This unique characteristic of the ocellate spot skate VNAR adds essential structural diversity to the naive VNAR library from elasmobranchs and could potentially benefit the development of pharmaceutical drugs.

AB  - A large number of herbivorous mammals and reptiles in many terrestrial ecosystems across the globe are presently in the receiving end of extinction. Over-exploitation by its immediate predator and anthropogenic actions is one of the main reasons. Reintroduction of apex predator or top predator at some instances has proven to be a successful strategy in restoring ecological balance. In this paper, we conceptualize the role of top predator in enriching the density of vulnerable species of lower trophic level, with the help of mathematical modeling. First, the dynamical behavior of two species system (prey and mesopredator) is studied, where growth of prey is subject to strong Allee effect. Also, the cost of predation induced fear is incorporated in the growth term. Parametric regions, for which the species perceive extinction risk are analyzed and depicted numerically. We consider that whenever density of the vulnerable species reach a certain threshold, minimum viable population, top predator is introduced in the habitat. Our obtained results show that a species population can be restored from the verge of extinction to a stable state with much higher population density with the introduction of top predator and even it stabilizes an oscillatory system.

AB  - Between September and December, whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) aggregate in the coastal waters off Nosy Be, an island in north-western Madagascar. Swimming with these sharks has become an important tourism activity, but no formal protection is in place in Madagascar to protect this endangered species from the potential negative effects of tourism or other human impacts. Boat-based surveys (n = 405) were conducted from tourism vessels from September to December, 2015-2019. For most sightings (98%), whale sharks were sighted while foraging for bait fish at the surface, in association with mackerel tuna (Euthynnus affinis) and seabirds (Sternidae). A total of 408 individual whale sharks were individually photo-identified over this period. All individuals were immature, and 82% of sexed sharks were male. Sharks ranged from 3.0 to 8.0 m in total length (TL), with a mean TL of 5.65 +/- 0.94 m (n = 66) for females and 5.46 +/- 1.09 m for males (n = 295). Most sharks (72% of the identified individuals) were only identified once within the study period. Movement modelling showed an open population with a short mean residence time of 7.2 days. Resightings were recorded from up to 12 years apart (2007-2019). Ten sharks were seen in all five seasons during 2015-2019. A basic POPAN mark-recapture model estimated a total population size of 681 (608-763) sharks over the 2015-2019 period. Nosy Be waters are an important foraging ground for juvenile whale sharks. Sighting data demonstrate that a high proportion of the sharks' preferred habitat lies outside existing protected areas, but within an identified Key Biodiversity Area. National species-level protection and increased spatial management is warranted to secure the continued presence of whale sharks in this region.

AB  - Change in the subtidal reef fish assemblage at Kuchierabu-jima Island, southern Japan, since the 1970s was investigated using an underwater visual census in October 2005. A comparison of this survey with data from 1972 revealed that the frequencies of species that had either increased, remained stable, or declined in abundance were dependent on the geographic range category and the major feeding guild. Temperate herbivorous fishes had noticeably declined in abundance, while subtropical carnivorous species had increased. We discuss causes of the change in the reef fish assemblage from the aspect of water temperature, loss of macroalgal beds, and anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - Darwin's finches are a classic example of adaptive radiation involving differential use of dietary resources among sympatric species. Here, we apply stable isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta H-2) analyses of feathers to examine ecological segregation among eight Darwin's finch species in Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos collected from live birds and museum specimens (1962-2019). We found that delta C-13 values were higher for the granivorous and herbivorous foraging guilds, and lower for the insectivorous finches. Values of delta N-15 were similar among foraging guilds but values of delta H-2 were higher for insectivores, followed by granivores, and lowest for herbivores. The herbivorous guild generally occupied the largest isotopic standard ellipse areas for all isotopic combinations and the insectivorous guild the smallest. Values of delta H-2 provided better trophic discrimination than those of delta N-15 possibly due to confounding influences of agricultural inputs of nitrogen. Segregation among guilds was enhanced by portraying guilds in three-dimensional isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta H-2) space. Values of delta C-13 and delta N-15 were higher for feathers of museum specimens than for live birds. We provide evidence that Darwin's finches on Santa Cruz Island tend to be generalists with overlapping isotopic niches and suggest that dietary overlap may also be more considerable than previously thought.

AB  - Large sharks shape ecosystems across their geographic ranges and have become a top research and conservation priority. Eastern North Pacific (ENP) white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) aggregations off the United States and Mexico are well described, but their population status is currently uncertain. Population assessments of ENP white sharks are complicated by migrations across international boundaries, vulnerability at aggregation sites, and undetermined mortality levels. While protective legislation exists both in the United States and Mexico, ongoing incidental and unreported catch may undermine assessments and management. Here, access to a clandestine artisanal fishery provides evidence for white shark abundance and mortality in the Gulf of California that has been underestimated by other methods (e.g., satellite telemetry, [by]catch data). Shark size estimates based on tooth measurements suggest abundance of both juvenile and mature sharks in the region, and updated population models indicate the potential for substantial impacts of this fishery on ENP population viability. The data here, fisher-provided information, and anecdotal evidence suggest potentially high abundance at two specific regions, making directed future research efforts feasible in the Gulf. These data demonstrate that cryptic life histories and geopolitical boundaries can still limit fundamental understanding of megafauna distribution, necessitating international cooperation for both research and management.

AB  - In view of the difficulties encountered when tuning parameters and the lack of anti-interference capabilities exhibited by high-precision trajectory-tracking control of quadrotor UAVs in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes a fusion control framework based on an improved crowned pig optimisation algorithm (ICPO) and preset performance anti-disturbance control (PPC-ADRC). Initially, this paper addresses the limited convergence efficiency of the traditional crowned pig algorithm (CPO) by introducing a dynamic time threshold mechanism and an adaptability-based directed elimination strategy to balance the algorithm's global exploration and local development capabilities. This results in a significant improvement in the convergence speed and optimisation accuracy. Secondly, a hierarchical control architecture is designed, with the outer loop using a PPC-ADRC controller to dynamically constrain the tracking error boundary using an exponential performance funnel function and a combined state observer (ESO) to estimate the compound disturbance in real time. The inner-loop attitude control uses ADRC, and the 24-dimensional parameters of the ADRC (including the ESO bandwidth and non-linear feedback gain) are optimised autonomously using the ICPO to achieve efficient parameter tuning. The simulation experiments demonstrate that, in comparison with the original CPO, the ICPO attains an average fitness ranking that is superior in the CEC2014-2022 benchmark test, thereby substantiating its global optimisation capability. In the PPC-ADRC controller parameter optimisation, the preset performance of the ICPO-tuned PPC-ADRC controller (PPC-ADRC) is superior to that of the particle swarm optimisation (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA) and original CPO. The ICPO-based PPC-ADRC controller is shown to reduce the total error by more than 45.6% compared to the ordinary ADRC controller in the task of tracking a spiral trajectory, and it effectively reduces the overshoot. Its capacity to withstand complex wind disturbances is notably superior to that of the traditional PID and ADRC architectures. Stability analysis further proves that the system satisfies the Lyapunov convergence condition in a finite time. This research provides a theoretical foundation for the high-precision control of UAVs in complex dynamic environments.

AB  - Since the 1980s, the field of anthracology has continued to expand in Southern Africa to study the interaction between past human societies and their environments, including plant resources and forest management from prehistoric times. To answer such questions, the need for comparative wood anatomy analyses of the local taxa is of particular relevance in this rich species environment to perform rigorous taxonomic identification. This paper introduces the first computerassisted identification tool specifically designed for the analysis of archaeological charcoals from Southern Africa. This online database, called SACHA for Southern African CHArcoals, is accessible via the following link: https://sacha.identificationkey. org/. It currently includes anatomical descriptions, as well as ecological and ethnobotanical information for 68 taxa of modemspecimens collected in the Savanna Biome. An identification key is available on the Xper3 online platform, which is designed for descriptive data management and interactive identification. This article presents a survey of the existing reference collections on Southern African woods and charcoals and proposes an overview of the development of computerised tools for systematic wood descriptions and identification keys. The SACHA database can be easily updated and enriched without requiring computer science skills. Furthermore, it can serve as a training tool for beginners in wood anatomy. The database offers an online interactive key option, a fact sheet catalogue, and conventional dichotomous and tabular keys for offline or printed versions. These functions are facilitated by the various export formats that are available in the database.

AB  - African antelope diversity is a globally unique vestige of a much richer world-wide Pleistocene megafauna. Despite this, the evolutionary processes leading to the prolific radiation of African antelopes are not well understood. Here, we sequenced 145 whole genomes from both subspecies of the waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), an African antelope believed to be in the process of speciation. We investigated genetic structure and population divergence and found evidence of a mid-Pleistocene separation on either side of the eastern Great Rift Valley, consistent with vicariance caused by a rain shadow along the so-called "Kingdon's Line." However, we also found pervasive evidence of both recent and widespread historical gene flow across the Rift Valley barrier. By inferring the genome-wide landscape of variation among subspecies, we found 14 genomic regions of elevated differentiation, including a locus that may be related to each subspecies' distinctive coat pigmentation pattern. We investigated these regions as candidate speciation islands. However, we observed no significant reduction in gene flow in these regions, nor any indications of selection against hybrids. Altogether, these results suggest a pattern whereby climatically driven vicariance is the most important process driving the African antelope radiation and suggest that reproductive isolation may not set in until very late in the divergence process. This has a significant impact on taxonomic inference, as many taxa will be in a gray area of ambiguous systematic status, possibly explaining why it has been hard to achieve consensus regarding the species status of many African antelopes. Our analyses demonstrate how population genetics based on low-depth whole genome sequencing can provide new insights that can help resolve how far lineages have gone along the path to speciation.

AB  - Subtropical humid grazing lands represent a large global land use and are important for livestock production, as well as supplying multiple ecosystem services. Patch-burn grazing (PBG) management is applied in temperate grazing lands to enhance environmental and economic sustainability; however, this management system has not been widely tested in subtropical humid grazing lands. The objective of this study was to determine how PBG affected forage resources, in comparison with the business-as-usual full-burn (FB) management in both intensively managed pastures (IMP) and seminative (SN) pastures in subtropical humid grazinglands. We hypothesized that PBG management would create patch contrasts in forage quantity and nutritive value in both IMP and SN pastures, with a greater effect in SN pastures. A randomized block design experiment was established in 2017 with 16 pastures (16 ha each), 8 each in IMP and SN at Archbold Biological Station's Buck Island Ranch in Florida.
   PBG management employed on IMP and SN resulted in creation of patch contrast in forage nutritive value and biomass metrics, and recent fire increased forage nutritive value. Residual standing biomass was significantly lower in burned patches of each year, creating heterogeneity within both pasture types under PBG. PBG increased digestible forage production in SN but not IMP pastures. These results suggest that PBG may be a useful management tool for enhancing forage nutritive value and creating patch contrast in both SN and IMP, but PBG does not necessarily increase production relative to FB management. The annual increase in tissue quality and digestible forage production in a PBG system as opposed to once every 3 yr in an FB system is an important consideration for ranchers. Economic impacts of PBG and FB management in the two different pasture types are discussed, and we compare and contrast results from subtropical humid grazing lands with continental temperate grazing lands.

AB  - Monitoring population trends for bird species in the Arctic and sub-Arctic can be difficult and cost prohibitive. Breeding populations of birds in these remote locations may be changing and have garnered much attention regarding their conservation. We analyzed data from bird lists (daily species observations) collected while conducting other targeted research to estimate trends in the probability of observing species at two sub-Arctic study sites. For Akimiski Island, Nunavut (52 species) we estimated positive trends with high confidence (95% credible limits do not include 0) for 14 species and negative trends with high confidence for 18. For Burntpoint Creek, Ontario (46 species) we estimated that 12 species had positive trends with high confidence and 12 had negative trends with high confidence. More than 60% of species at each site matched population trends for at least one of three larger geographic scales that we compared estimates with; regional, provincial and national. We hypothesized that trends may be due to climate change effects or because of effects related to intensive herbivory from nesting geese. Trends for most of the species where we made specific predictions from these hypotheses agreed with those predicted; however, well-designed experiments are needed to conclusively determine the driving mechanisms of these trends. Collecting bird list data while simultaneously conducting other research is not nearly as time consuming or expensive as targeted breeding bird surveys (e.g., point counts, call counts, nest searching, etc.). This analysis method may be of utility for other remote field study sites where gaps in trend data exist.

AB  - Top predators can affect the behaviour of prey species via lethal (direct kill) or non-lethal effects (i.e., through predation risk). For example, prey species may move from areas perceived as risky to safer spaces where predation risk is lower, which can have important consequences for investment in foraging, movement, and mating, and for the behaviour and habitat use of other species, such as mesopredators. These changes in prey and mesopredator behaviours are likely mediated by the presence of predator cues in the environment. Here, we test how different predator cues (visual and odor) from familiar and novel predators (brown bear and Amur tiger, respectively) influence ungulate, mesopredator, and top predator visitation rates to camera trap sites in a national nature reserve in China. The comparison of these predator types is of particular interest in this region as Amur tigers may shortly be reintroduced here. We found that visual but not odour cues significantly affected ungulate visitation rates: ungulates showed reduced visitation to sites with either a novel or familiar visual predator cue. When combined, mesopredators and top predators also showed a small reduction in visitation rates to tiger cue sites compared to bear cue sites, suggesting a possible novel predator effect. The generalisation and contextual importance of predator cues for prey and mesopredators have been little studied. Understanding how species respond to novel cues may help to determine extinction probabilities and overall plasticity in the face of change. This study is, therefore, an important step forward in understanding predator cue responses at the community level. This is also the first study to test the ecological function of Amur tiger cues in the wild environment and may serve as essential information in the rewilding process of captive Amur tiger plans.

AB  - About 100 years ago, groups of European beech were reintroduced into Norway spruce stands in some parts of Germany as a restoration approach. The aim of this approach was to maintain or rehabilitate the ecological function of soil fertility and the regeneration option of beech for the next generation. The effect of beech groups on surrounding spruce stands was studied in the Ore Mountains by recording natural regeneration of beech and humus layer thickness and form. Point pattern statistics were used to analyse the spread of beech regeneration and to determine factors influencing its establishment. It was found that the density of regeneration decreases with increasing distance from the beech group. However, beech regeneration was found up to distances of 69 m. Furthermore, it becomes evident that PAR radiation (maximum regeneration densities at PAR values of 35 W/m(2)) and fencing (3.41 times higher regeneration density compared to unfenced areas) against deer have a positive influence on beech regeneration density. Ordered categorical models were used to model humus form and non-linear models were used to model humus layer thickness. It could be proven that the most bioactive humus forms and lowest humus layer thicknesses were found within the beech group. With increasing distance to the beech group, the total humus layer thickness and the proportion of mormoder in the spruce stand increased. The positive influence of the beech group on the humus composition extends to about 40 m from the centre of the beech group. Due to the former arrangement of the beech groups in the terrain, the effects can also extend to the spruce stands in between. The hypotheses on the restoration approach of reintroducing groups of beech into spruce stands formulated by foresters 100 years ago can thus be confirmed. For future restoration approaches of spruce stands, groupwise mixtures of beech should be established with a distance of 40-50 m.

AB  - American Eel Anguilla rostrata populations along the Atlantic coast of the United States have been in decline over the past several decades. One suggested cause of the decline is construction of barriers that block access to upstream tributaries where they can spend a significant portion of their lives. Success of reintroduction efforts above barriers has rarely been evaluated. Within the Susquehanna River (Chesapeake Bay watershed), over 1 million eels were released above four major downstream barriers in the past decade. We used backpack electrofishing and tagging to monitor growth, sexual differentiation, and population density of reintroduced eels in Buffalo Creek, a tributary to the Susquehanna River (Pennsylvania). From 2012 to 2019, we caught over 2,000 individuals, tagged more than 1,800, and recaptured 229. Recaptured eels provided insight into growth, sexual differentiation, and movement. Nearly 99% of recaptures remained near stocking locations. The average growth rate was 47.8 mm/y and ranged between -5.8 and 116.0 mm/y. Females generally grew significantly faster than males, and growth rates of several females exceeded 100 mm/y, a rate typically associated with estuarine residents. The population density within stocking sites was over 2,300 eels/km, roughly four times higher than Susquehanna River tributaries below the most downstream dam, and exceeded the target stocking goal of 529 eels/km. While we caught most eels in areas sampled near stocking locations, we captured some eels in smaller upstream tributaries away from stocking locations. Our study is the first to examine how reintroduced eels grow following stocking above four major dams on the Susquehanna River. We suggest that managers considering moving eels above blockages account for release location and density to achieve desired benefits to the overall population.

AB  - Although dietary studies have provided important insights into the causes and ramifications of diet variation for the southern elephant seal (SES) (Mirounga leonina), adult males are comparatively underrepresented within that literature. Individual males can vary morphologically as well as behaviourally, leading to differences in their life history trajectories and outcomes. Therefore, to improve our understanding of the male diet, we sought to determine the degree of dietary variation between as well as within individuals from the West Antarctic Peninsula. Secondly, we investigated whether individual morphological traits, seasonality, and year influenced their dietary variation. Whiskers were sampled from 31 adult male seals and used to measure the bulk stable isotope nitrogen (delta 15N). We sequentially segmented each whisker to create a time series of datapoints for each individual, allowing us to compare delta 15N variation within each seal as well as assess variation between the seals. We then investigated the relationships between male dietary variation and body length, girth, season, and year. We found that adult male SESs maintained an extremely specialised diet. Variation between individuals was strongly correlated with their body size, with larger seals feeding higher up the trophic web. Interestingly, seasonality and year both influenced variation within the seals' diets, but only year was seen to influence the variability between seals. We discuss the possible causes and ramifications of dietary specialisation for the SES and highlight the need for combined tracking and stable isotope investigations to improve our understanding of the ontogeny of the seals' dietary specialisation.

AB  - In Malaysia, escalating human-wildlife conflicts pose significant risks to both human populations and wildlife species, highlighting the need for advanced systems for effective conflict management. This study introduces the Geo Wild System (GWS), a novel Progressive Web Application (PWA) specifically tailored for Malaysian contexts. GWS integrates data from diverse sources, including citizen reports, park rangers, and licensed hunters, and employs Geographic Information System (GIS) tools to enhance data visualization and identify conflict hotspots. During the study period from January to June 2024, GWS recorded and facilitated the deployment of 117 traps across six districts: Shah Alam, Hulu Selangor, Sungai Besar, Hulu Langat, Georgetown, and Seberang Prai. These deployments, based on reported conflict data, resulted in the capture of 88 wildlife individuals, including 85 long-tailed macaques ( Macaca fascicularis), ), two wild boars ( Sus scrofa), ), and one Asian palm civets ( Paradoxurus hermaphroditus), ), demonstrating the system's operational effectiveness. GWS supports a comprehensive reporting, monitoring, and analysis system, utilizing GIS-based Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to pinpoint critical conflict hotspots, particularly in rapidly urbanizing areas. User feedback was overwhelmingly positive, highlighting the system's user-friendliness and robust data integration. Despite initial deployment challenges and geodetic constraints, GWS has proven to be a valuable tool for mitigating wildlife conflicts, enabling informed, timely management responses, and offering a promising approach to adaptive wildlife management in Malaysia.

AB  - Trends in rhinoceroses (rhinos) in Kruger National Park (Kruger) is of key concern. Poaching drives trends in the Park. Reconciling annual population estimates with yearly reports of poached carcasses fuels public critique. We account for trends in rhinos by extracting time series of estimates. Progressively modelling influences of man-agement introductions and removals, effects of environmental variation and rhino density, direct impacts of poaching, consequences of imperfect carcass detection, and indirect impacts of deaths of dependent calves form the basis of accounting for rhinos. Models that considered all these influences explained 93% of white and 83% of black rhino population trends. In addition, the models predicted 2,515 white and 225 black rhinos, similar to estimates of 2,607 (95% CI: 2,475-2,752) and 202 (95% CI: 172-237) during 2020 respectively. The best model, however, predicts slow recovery with a white rhino population equivalent to pre-poaching achieved between 2030 and 2040. For black rhinos, recovery to pre-poaching population size would be between 2040 and 2050. The poaching onslaught in Kruger disrupted eruptive white rhino dynamics and prevented black rhinos from transitioning into eruptive dynamics. Authorities require innovative approaches within and beyond Kruger to help re-ignite rhino conservation.

AB  - The white-red deer population in China is composed of 28 individuals introduced from New Zealand. However, the genetic relationships between these individuals is unknown. The aim of the present study was to determine the genetic diversity and genetic relationship in the white-red deer population. We used ten microsatellite loci to genotype all 28 white-red deer individuals in China, and constructed a Neighbor -joining (NJ) tree based on genetic distances. In addition, genetic structure analysis was carried out. The results showed that a total of 67 alleles were detected, and the average number of alleles at each locus was 6.7. There was high genetic diversity but severe inbreeding in the white-red deer population, and there is no father-mother-offspring relationship or father-offspring relationship in white-red deer population. Our study provides the essential data support and reference for the conservation and sustainable development of the domestic white-red deer population in China.

AB  - AimSpecies Distribution Models (SDMs) are widely used to map species distribution and predict future responses to climate change. While the risk of selecting biologically non-relevant predictors has been raised, numerous studies continue to fully rely on statistical approaches to automatically select predictors solely focusing on climate variables. Yet, relying only on climate can have important implications for the reliability of the estimated relationships and predictions. Here, we illustrate the implications of ignoring species biology when modelling species distribution.LocationWest Palearctic.TaxonBoreus westwoodi Hagen, Crucianella maritima L., Rhinolophus hipposideros (Bechstein).MethodsWe compared a naive, statistically-informed model selection approach (relying on the full set of 19 bioclimatic variables) with expert-informed models where we included only variables specifically linked to a species' biology. We tested our approach on three case study species: B. westwoodi, a Palaearctic insect related to snow cover; C. maritima, a Mediterranean coastal dune plant; and R. hipposideros, a forest bat occurring across Europe and the Middle East.ResultsThe two variable selection approaches identified different sets of variables as relevant in all case studies; although the models yielded similar predictive performance. This resulted in consistent differences between predictions under current and novel conditions, along with differences in interpretability of response curves, driven by variables with no clear ecological significance.Main ConclusionsWe emphasise the importance of a thoughtful selection of predictors based on species biology over naive bioclimatic models. We argue that taxonomy, general adaptations and biome characteristics can guide variable selection when species-specific information is lacking and that a rational exclusion of non-relevant variables is often feasible even with limited knowledge. Strengthening the ecological foundation of SDMs will enhance their utility in climate change impact assessments and support biodiversity conservation efforts.

AB  - Significant spatiotemporal variation in human livelihood patterns and its relationship to trans-Eurasian exchange and climate change in north China during the late Neolithic and Bronze Age, has been intensively studied in recent years, but the comprehensive influence of natural and social factors on this variation is not well understood. Therefore, we analyze archaeobotanical, zooarchaeological and carbon isotopic data from late Neolithic and Bronze Age sites in agricultural, pastoral, and agro-pastoral regions of north China. Our results demonstrate human subsistence strategies transformed at different speeds in these three geographic areas after wheat, barley, and sheep, goats, and cattle were introduced into north China. Introduced crops and livestock dominated human livelihoods in pastoral regions and became important subsistence in areas above similar to 1500 m a.s.l. in agro-pastoral regions after similar to 3600 BP. In agricultural regions, indigenous millet crops were the most important subsistence throughout 6000-2200 BP, but wheat use increased significantly around 2700 BP. Our study suggests that the introduction of new crops and herbivorous livestock related to the prehistoric trans-Eurasian exchange, and their adaptive advantage in high-cold environments might have rapidly facilitated human adaptability and social development in pastoral regions and northwest margin of agro-pastoral regions during the Bronze Age.

AB  - Roads are an important driver of economic development. However, roads also produce negative impacts on humans and wildlife as noise contamination, pollution, habitat loss and fragmentation and mortality due to collisions. It has been observed that roadkill threatens populations of mammals, thus the importance for mitigating actions. Here, we documented roadkill of medium-sized mammals on a 114 km of highway located in southern Mexico. A total of 41 roadkill events were recorded of which the northern anteater Tamandua mexicana, the Mexican porcupine Coendou mexicanus, and the common hog-nosed skunk Conepatus leuconotus showed the highest frequency. The northern anteater is regionally considered at risk, and the other two species as threatened. It was estimated that approximately 36.2 medium-sized mammals are road killed annually, with the northern anteater ranking highest with a third of the total. Most of the collisions occurred at sites with less than 20 % tree cover and less than 350 m from water bodies; half occurred less than 500 m from the nearest highway curve. At the local scale, distance to water bodies and closeness to human settlements were significantly related to road collisions. At the landscape scale, the presence of water bodies was related to roadkill. This highway is acting as a sink for medium-sized mammal populations, particularly for the northern anteater. We propose to establish preventive actions such as reducing speed limits, putting speed bumps, driving fences, ropes, signs in strategic places, and police surveillance. We also propose a program to convince local inhabitants and drivers using this road of the importance of preventing roadkill of wildlife.

AB  - Simple Summary Predicting suitable areas and paths for African swine fever (ASF) outbreaks is crucial for early detection and removal of ASF virus (ASFV)-infected carcasses in ASF-prevalent regions, as well as for the establishment of preemptive quarantine measures in ASF-free regions. In this study, we utilized the MaxEnt model and shortest-path betweenness centrality to predict areas with a high likelihood of ASF outbreaks in wild boars while also identifying individual pig farms and pig farm sectors at high risk of ASFV spillover from wild boars. The results of this study are intended to help to save time and cost in searching for carcasses by specifying the search range for ASFV-infected wild boar carcasses. Additionally, the study's findings could help pig farms at high risk of ASFV spillover establish preemptive quarantine measures such as reinforcing biosecurity inside the farms and routinely searching for carcasses around the farms. African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious disease affecting domestic pigs and wild boars, with no effective vaccine or treatment available. In South Korea, extensive measures have been implemented to prevent ASF transmission between wild boars and ASF spillover from wild boars to pig farm sectors, including the search for ASF-infected carcasses in mountainous forests and the installation of fences across wide areas of these forests. To determine the priority search range for infected carcasses and establish pig farm-centered quarantine measures, it is necessary to predict the specific path of ASF outbreaks in wild boars and identify pig farms at high risk of ASF spillover from wild boars. Here, we aimed to predict suitable areas and geographical paths for ASF outbreaks in wild boars using the MaxEnt model and shortest-path betweenness centrality analysis. The analysis identified a high frequency of ASF outbreaks in areas with a suitability value & GE;0.4 on the suitability map and in areas within a 1.8 km range from the path on the shortest-path map, indicating these areas were high-risk zones for ASF outbreaks. Among the 5063 pig farms analyzed, 37 were in the high-risk zone on the suitability map, 499 were in the high-risk zone on the shortest-path map, and 9 were in both risk zones. Of the 51 pig farm sectors with a dense distribution of pig farms (kernel density & GE; 8), 25 sectors were in contact with or partially overlapped the high risk zone on the suitability map, 18 sectors were located within the high risk zone on the shortest-path map, and 14 sectors were located within both risk zones. These findings aided in determining the priority range for searches for wild boar carcasses and enabled the establishment of preemptive ASF prevention measures around the pig farming sectors that are at risk of ASF spillover from wild boars.

AB  - Plants growing in nutrient-rich environment are predicted to be less defended than conspecifics under nutrient limitation. However, less is known about the effects of nutrient levels on tolerance and induced resistance, and whether the effects differ between native and introduced populations of invasive plants. We performed a greenhouse experiment with introduced (the USA) and native (Argentina) genotypes of Alternanthera philoxeroides in order to study the effects of soil nitrogen levels on plant growth, constitutive and herbivore (Agasicles hygrophila)-induced chemical defense, and herbivory tolerance. We measured total biomass, elongation rate (as proxy of growth rate), carbon and nitrogen, and the concentration of triterpenoid saponins (defensive chemicals) in leaves and roots. Constitutive resistance (+33% higher leaf triterpenoid saponins in control treatment at low nitrogen level) and tolerance [less decreased total biomass after herbivory treatment (-24% and -15% for high and low nitrogen levels)] were favored at lower nitrogen level, while induced resistance was favored at higher nitrogen level (+24% increased leaf triterpenoid saponins after herbivory treatment at high nitrogen level). Constitutive resistance and tolerance exhibited trade-offs with growth rate, while induced resistance positively correlated with growth rate. Additionally, the introduced genotypes had -6% lower content of leaf carbon in the presence of herbivores than the native genotypes at low nitrogen level, but such difference was absent at high nitrogen level. Our results indicate that soil nitrogen levels influence the preference of different defensive strategies of plant, and interweave with herbivory to determine the performance of introduced genotypes.

AB  - Determining the relative influence of biotic and abiotic processes in structuring communities at local to large spatial scales is best understood using a biogeographic comparative-experimental approach. Using this approach, previous work suggests that intertidal community dynamics (top-down and bottom-up effects) vary unimodally along an upwelling-based productivity gradient, termed the Intermittent Upwelling Hypothesis (IUH). Evidence consistent with the IUH comes from the sessile invertebrate/predator (SIP) subweb in certain rocky intertidal communities, but whether this pattern extends to macrophyte/herbivore (MH) subwebs is unknown. Here we ask: Are MH subwebs also structured as predicted by the IUH? What is the relative importance of herbivory and predation in structuring these communities? Under what conditions do ecological subsidies like nutrients or propagule production drive community dynamics? And are omnivorous interactions important? We hypothesize that MH subwebs are driven by a new construct, the Grazing-Weakening Hypothesis (GWH), which states that MH interactions weaken monotonically with increasing nutrients, with strong (weak) herbivory and low (high) macrophyte productivity at low (high) nutrients. We explored local-to-large spatial scale dynamics of both subwebs using a biogeographic comparative-experimental factorial field experiment testing joint and separate effects of herbivores and predators between two continents. Experiments at 10 sites ranging from persistent upwelling to persistent downwelling regimes ran for 26-29 months in Oregon and California, and New Zealand (NZ) South Island. For the MH subweb, results were consistent with the GWH: herbivory declined and macrophytes increased with increasing nutrients. As expected, results for the SIP subweb were consistent with the IUH: predator effect size was unimodally related to upwelling. Overall, herbivory explained more variation in community structure than did predation, especially in NZ. Omnivory was weak, sessile invertebrates outcompeted macrophytes, and ocean-driven subsidies provided the basic template driving ecosystem dynamics. We propose a unified meta-ecosystem dynamics model combining MH and SIP results: with increased upwelling, sessile invertebrates and underlying dynamics vary unimodally (as in the IUH), while herbivory decreases and macrophytes generally increase. While this model was based on research in temperate ecosystems varying in upwelling regime, its wider applicability remains to be tested.

AB  - The role of predation by large carnivores in suppressing prey populations and structuring ecosystems is highly debated, calling for a detailed understanding of carnivore diets. Wolves (Canis lupus) roam across three continents and persist throughout widely different ecosystems. Their diet is flexible and may vary spatially as well as seasonally, which requires analysis of diet on different spatial and temporal scales. Few studies have investigated the summer diet of wolves, which is more variable, consists of smaller prey, and requires different methods than studying their winter diet. To better understand the summer diet of wolves, we combined three independently collected wolf scat data sets from three distinctly different portions of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem: Yellowstone National Park (2009), Grand Teton National Park (2003 - 2009), and the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness (2009 - 2010). These areas represent different ecological conditions and management regimes, which may impact wolf diet. We estimated relative biomass and compared occurrence of different prey species among packs, years, as well as the three regions. In total, we analyzed 1,906 wolf scats and found that neonate cervids, adult elk, and adult deer were the most important prey species in the summer diet of the wolves. We found dietary variation among packs residing in the same area, as well as across years. The occurrence of neonate cervids displayed the most variation, and low occurrence of this prey type often was associated with a more diverse diet. Wolf packs within the national parks had a higher occurrence of medium-sized prey (similar to 50 - 70 kg) and lower occurrence of small-sized prey (<= 20 kg) compared to wolves in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness. These results demonstrate flexibility in summer diet across packs, years, and between regions within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

AB  - The 18 extant members of the Tribe Phloeomyini, the "cloud rats," constitute an endemic Philippine radiation of arboreal herbivores that range in size from ca. 18 g to 2.7 kg, most occurring in cloud forest above 1,200 m elevation. Although calibrated phylogenies indicate that the Phloeomyini is estimated to have begun diversifying within the Philippines by ca. 10-11 million years ago, no extinct fossil species have been described, severely limiting our understanding of this distinctive radiation. Our studies of fossil and subfossil small mammal assemblages from the lowland Callao Caves complex in NE Luzon, Philippines, have produced specimens of Phloeomyini that date from ca. 67,000 BP to the Late Holocene (ca. 4,000 to 2,000 BP). We identify three extinct species that we name as new members assigned to the genera Batomys, Carpomys, and Crateromys, distinguished from congeners by body size, distinctive dental and other morphological features, and occupancy of a habitat (lowland forest over limestone) that differs from the high-elevation mossy forest over volcanic soils occupied by their congeners. Batomys cagayanensis n. sp. is known only from two specimens from ca. 67,000 BP; Carpomys dakal n. sp. and Crateromys ballik n. sp. were present from ca. 67,000 BP to the Late Holocene. These add to the species richness and morphological diversity of this endemic Philippine radiation of large folivores, and show specifically that the lowland fauna of small mammals on Luzon was more diverse in the recent past than it is currently, and that Luzon recently supported five species of giant rodents (ca. 1 kg or more). All three occurred contemporaneously with Homo luzonensis, and two, the new Carpomys and Crateromys, persisted until the Late Holocene when multiple exotic mammal species, both domestic and invasive, were introduced to Luzon, and new cultural practices (such as making pottery) became evident, suggesting that modern humans played a role in their extinction.

AB  - In a time of global change, having an understanding of the nature of biotic and abiotic factors that drive a species' range may be the sharpest tool in the toolbox of conservation and management of threatened species. However, such information are lacking for most tropical and epiphytic species due to the complexity of life history, the roles of stochastic events, and the diversity of habitat across the span of a distribution. In this study, we conducted repeated census across the core and peripheral range of Trichocentrum undulatum, a threatened orchid that is found throughout the island of Cuba (species core range) and southern Florida (the northern peripheral range). We used demographic matrix modeling and stochastic simulations to investigate the impacts of herbivory, hurricanes, and logging (in Cuba) on projected population growth rates (lambda and lambda(s)) among sites. Our study indicates that the Florida population is under high extinction risk and most populations in the core range show less interannual variability, but, with the exception of one population, are also in decline. The peripheral population experienced higher herbivory damage than did the core populations, by a native inflorescence-crippling fly, Melanagromyza miamensis, and an invasive, mortality-triggered scale, Diaspis boisduvalii. The latter was found in the Florida population only. Hurricanes increased levels of mortality and had a negative effect on lambda. However, lambda increased following hurricane events due to increased recruitment and decreased herbivory. Life table response experiments suggest that higher adult survival was the largest contributor to the higher lambda observed in the growing Cuba populations, as compared with the population in Florida. Logging simulations in Cuba indicate that populations can maintain stability only if selective logging of host trees occurs at low frequency. Reintroduction of the species in its northern peripheral habitat is needed to ameliorate the threats from sea-level rise and invasive herbivorous insects to secure the current species' northern, continental range margin. Our study exhibits how vital rates and ecological interactions vary across a species distribution and respond under differing stochastic events.

AB  - As part of the current global change scenario, invasive species have caused many direct impacts on native biodiversity and the interactions among species. European rabbits and hares are two herbivore species that have been introduced worldwide, displacing native species within their trophic level, but also affecting native predators. Both species have become extremely abundant in their exotic distributions, becoming primary prey for many predators, a function that they also play in their native ranges. These relatively new and strong interaction links created with their consumers have the potential to destabilize food webs by precluding the occurrence of weaker links. Here, we have compiled the diet of 32 predator species from three food webs and compared them: one in Europe, where these species are native, and two where they are introduced, in South America and Oceania. We found that these lagomorphs are the primary prey in all study sites, generating a dietary shift of predators in the invaded regions. In all food webs studied, these two preys channeled most of the biomass input towards the higher trophic level, generating the strongest interaction links, affecting the food web configuration and stability. They destabilize food web structure by homogenizing predators' diets, augmenting their niche overlap and web vulnerability. Moreover, rapid population changes of these prey, either natural (e.g., diseases) or anthropic (e.g., control measures), create new conservation challenges for predators and scavengers. This highlights that invasive species can strongly affect interactions among species and it should be considered in management and conservation actions.

AB  - Resource specific competition between predators has typically been studied from their interactions at mesoherbivore carcasses, because such carcasses are abundant. Mega-carcasses like those of elephants are rare but unparalleled in the extent of carrion biomass they offer and the long durations they can persist. These rare resource bonanzas can thus provide unique opportunities to understand sympatric species interactions within likely relaxed competitive scenarios. Using remote cameras that were operational 24-h a day, we monitored two elephant carcasses in Tsavo, Kenya, from when they were discovered until they were completely consumed or became inaccessible. While we found high temporal overlaps in activity patterns between all predators, the terrestrial predator guild (lion/leopard/spotted hyena) was not observed to feed simultaneously, suggesting strong interference competition. Based on photo-analysis and video-evidence of exclusion from a carcass, interference competition within the terrestrial predator guild favored lions over hyenas, and hyenas over leopards. The carcass at the terrestrial-aquatic interface showed more simultaneous feeding bouts between predators (crocodile/spotted hyena), indicating either facilitation and/or higher coexistence between predators that typically occupy different niches. We also observed a hippopotamus scavenging from an elephant carcass, thereby documenting a rare instance of a megaherbivore feeding on a megaherbivore. Our results highlight the importance of monitoring such carcasses through remote cameras, which can significantly add to our existing understanding of food webs and carrion ecology.

AB  - The rusa deer has been introduced to Merauke region and later to Vogelkop Peninsula in Indonesian New Guinea (West Papua) in 1928. It has widely dispersed across much of the West Papuan lowlands, but little is known on population size and its role for the livelihoods of rural communities. Here, our aim was to assess the population status of rusa deer, and to investigate the extent of hunting practices on this mammal in West Papua. We conducted camera trapping and line transect surveys simultaneously to estimate rusa deer population abundance in the Kwoor basin of the Tambrauw regency, Papua Barat province, Indonesia. We also interviewed hunters (n = 134), informants (n = 9) and households (n = 91) to assess hunting patterns and socioeconomic importance of rusa deer across 15 districts of the Tambrauw regency. We estimated rusa deer density within a 48-km(2) forested area at 10.34 (5.36-19.98) and 21.04 individuals/km(2) using line transect and N-mixture modelling approach using camera trapping data, respectively. Both density estimates are considerably higher than those from its native range in Java and Bali (0.08 individual/km(2)). Almost 92% of hunters reported that they hunted rusa deer in their traditional forests, being the most frequent amongst the 18 hunted species, particularly for commercial (62%) and subsistence (38%) purposes. Our results suggest that traditional hunting has become a significant livelihood activity and important income source in the study area. It is therefore imperative to identify potential management strategies on wildlife hunting while also considering that the high densities of introduced rusa deer may potentially exert adverse effects on native flora and fauna. This study further suggests that traditional knowledge (locally called 'sasi' system) and wildlife taboos still govern wildlife hunting and utilization of forest resources in West Papua, and these need to play a role in integrated community-based wildlife management.

AB  - Evaluating the mechanisms that drive plant invasions in grassland ecosystems can provide insight into subtle, yet critical, drivers of ecosystem function. Common hypotheses for invader success are that (1) an invader's physiology may allow better use of resources and competitively exclude resident natives; (2) the lack of invader-specific herbivores and diseases may result in increased growth and competitive advantage over natives; (3) invaders may bring pathogens or herbivores that negatively impact native plants directly; (4) the invader may be able to establish earlier or later than natives, giving it a priority effect or phenological niche separation; (5) the invader may produce more seeds, and propagule pressure may allow it to eventually dominate; and (6) once the invader occurs on a site, its plant detritus or litter can offer a legacy effect advantage. Yet, a widely neglected aspect of invasion is that invaders may prime the conditions in places other than where they are currently established, giving them a pioneer effect advantage. These pioneer effects can come from plant materials that move from invaded to uninvaded areas through three pathways-pollen, litter, seeds, and their associated microbiomes-each of which can favor the invader directly or indirectly. In turn, unsuccessful cohorts of seedlings can change the biotic community through root exudates as well as any biotic load they bring with them, along with taking up nutrients and potentially subverting the litter decay cycle. When seedlings of invaders occur at times when the native species have evolved not to germinate, site priming impacts may increase or accelerate. We propose that monitoring of uninvaded areas adjacent to invaded areas is needed to assess the emerging significance of pioneer effects and site priming in advancing plant invasions, especially in grassland systems worldwide.

AB  - Bottom[and hardwoods forests (BLHW) are increasingly subject to active management for water quality improvement, streambank stabilization, to mitigate for urban expansion and to improve habitat for wildlife. Since the majority of remaining BLHW are degraded, restoration attempts are becoming commonplace within the Western Gulf Coastal Plain (WGCP) of the US. However, restoration success in terms of obtaining high stem densities of desirable species has been mixed, with managers observing survival rates <15 per cent for planted oak and hickory seedlings in some situations due to a variety of [imitations. Over two growing seasons, we investigated the effectiveness of portable electric fences, individual tree shelters and 2.4-m woven wire high fences for mitigating herbivory by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and feral swine (Sus scrofa). Treatments fell within degraded forested areas and abandoned agricultural fields where we tested four species of interest: Nuttak oak (Quercus texana Buckley), Shumard oak (Q. shumardii Buckley), bur oak (Q. macrocarpa Michx.) and pecan (Carya illinoinensis K. Koch). Where herbivory occurred, mitigation techniques produced a higher survival rate (<(X)over bar> = 17.6 per cent) than unprotected areas ((X) over bar = 9.1 per cent). In areas of high white-tailed deer density, prominent browsing was evident, resulting in two-growing-season height growth of seedlings being Less in non-fenced ((X) over bar = 2.33 cm) and electric (X = 4.33 cm) fenced plots compared with high fences ((X) over bar = 13.02 cm) and individual tree shelters ((X) over bar = 24.23 cm). Additionally, we observed a negative relationship between survival and the number of days seedlings that were inundated with flood waters during the growing season. Matching species of interest to the site conditions, specifically the local hydrologic regimes, should carry a high priority in planning a restoration project within BLHW in the WGCP.

AB  - Feral cattle (Bos taurus) live in socially stable herds. Due to farm management practices, intensively managed dairy cows experience frequent regrouping, which can disrupt affiliative bonds and induce social stress. This study examines how changes in herd composition affect milk yield and udder health traits in resident dairy cows exposed to the withdrawal of herd members or the introduction of new individuals. Milk yield, electrical conductivity, and blood presence in milk were measured in 798 cows using precision dairy sensors over 9 years. Milk yield decreased significantly (p < 0.001) one day after the removal of familiar herd members, while introducing cows had no effect. A higher number of cows being withdrawn (up to 10) was associated with reduced milk yield (p < 0.001), elevated milk electrical conductivity (p = 0.01), and an increased prevalence of blood presence in milk (p = 0.01), which can indicate potential udder health issues linked to social stress. Holstein Friesian, primiparous, and first-lactation-stage cows were more affected than Czech Simental and multiparous cows later in lactation. These findings underscore the influence of social stability on dairy cow welfare and productivity, emphasising the need for strategies to mitigate stress when herd changes are necessary.

AB  - Historically, desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) were prevalent throughout the Trans -Pecos region of Texas. However, they were extirpated by the 1960s due to unregulated hunting, habitat loss, predation, and disease transmission from livestock. Restoration efforts have been successfully conducted by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to increase population numbers of resident (i.e., animals that currently populate a region of inter-est) desert bighorn sheep at Black Gap Wildlife Management Area (BGWMA) through the use of translocations. Because there is a lack of knowledge on alternative release methods for large mammal translocations, our goals were to monitor cause-specific mortality and postrelease survival of desert bighorn sheep translocated during 2017. Survival estimates of desert bighorn sheep were compared amongst resident, hard-released, and soft-released individuals throughout the study. In winter 2017-2018, we radio-collared and released 30 resident (8 M, 22 F) and 70 within-state-translocated (36 M, 34 F) desert bighorn to BGWMA. Of the 70 translocated individuals, 28 (12 M, 16 F) were hard released (i.e., released immediately onto the landscape) and 42 (24 M, 18 F) were soft released (i.e., released into an enclosure before onto the landscape). Resident desert bighorn had the highest probability of survival over time (S = 0.83), followed by hard-released (S = 0.67) and then soft-released (S = 0.54) individuals. To date, 26 mortalities (13 M, 13 F) were recorded. Of those mortalities, 4 were residents (15%), 6 were hard released (23%), and 16 were soft released (62%). The soft release is thought to be a better strategy for translocating large mammals; however, in this study, it did not improve survival. Survival is potentially influenced by acclimation time and individual exit strategy from the soft-release pen, which should be managed for future restoration efforts. Incorporating a flushing-method exit strategy would aid in removing soft-released individuals from the high-fenced pen simultaneously and may increase survival estimates. This could potentially allow individuals to form larger groups when exiting the enclosure and entering the new habitat. The soft-release method is also more costly to implement, which could be challenging for wildlife managers.

AB  - A BSTRACT : The Blue Economy is estimated to be worth over USD 2.5 trillion annually, or almost 3% of the world's GDP in 2020. St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) in the Caribbean region has a vast and rich marine space that is underutilized. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of pearl oyster and sponge farming to advance the country's Blue Economy through sustainable mariculture. A qualitative approach was applied, using a literature review and thematic analysis of data gathered through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with relevant stakeholders. Among several species evaluated, the result of the study revealed that the Pinctada imbricata oyster species and Hippospongia lachne sponge species are the most suitable for cultivation in SVG coastal waters, specifically in the Ashton Lagoon of Union Island. The study concluded that while there is strong support from the stakeholders in SVG for pearl oyster and sponge farming in the country, challenges still exist. Nevertheless, it has been found that by learning and adopting the strategies of the leading Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Blue Economy development combined with the critical enablers such as meticulous planning, stakeholder collaboration, establishment of legal frameworks, and ecosystem-based management, pearl oyster and sponge mariculture in the identified location in SVG could potentially aid the expansion of the country's Blue Economy.

AB  - Direct application of pig slurry to agricultural land, as a means of nutrient recycling, introduces pathogens, antibiotic resistant bacteria, or genes, to the environment. With global environmental sustainability policies mandating a reduction in synthetic fertilisation and a commitment to a circular economy it is imperative to find effective on-farm treatments of slurry that maximises its fertilisation value and minimises risk to health and the environment. We assessed and compared the effect of storage, composting, and anaerobic digestion (AD) on pig slurry microbiome, resistome and nutrient content. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and HT-qPCR arrays were implemented to understand the dynamics across the treatments. Our results identified that each treatment methods have advantages and disadvantages in removal pollutants or increasing nutrients. The data suggests that storage and composting are optimal for the removal of human pathogens and anaerobic digestion for the reduction in antibiotic resistance (AMR) genes and mobile genetic elements. The nitrogen content is increased in storage and AD, while reduced in composting. Thus, depending on the requirement for increased or reduced nitrogen the optimum treatment varies. Combining the results indicates that composting provides the greatest gain by reducing risk to human health and the environment. Network analysis revealed reducing Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes while increasing Firmicutes will reduce the AMR content. KEGG analysis identified no significant change in the pathways across all treatments. This novel study provides a data driven decision tree to determine the optimal treatment for best practice to minimise pathogen, AMR and excess or increasing nutrient transfer from slurry to environment.

AB  - Most species of wild felids are threatened, but for many little is known about their status in the wild. For the cryptic and elusive Vulnerable Sunda clouded leopard Neofelis diardi, key metrics such as abundance and occupancy have been challenging to obtain. We conducted an intensive survey for this species on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. We deployed camera traps across four study areas that varied in elevation and threats, for a total of 28,404 trap nights, resulting in 114 independent clouded leopard photographs, in which we identified 18 individuals. Using a Bayesian spatially explicit capture-recapture analysis, we estimated clouded leopard density to be 0.8-2.4 individuals/100 km(2). The highest predicted occurrence of people was at lower altitudes and closer to the forest edge, where we categorized more than two-thirds of people recorded by camera traps as bird poachers, 12.5% each as ungulate/tiger poachers and non-timber collectors, and < 2% as fishers. Our findings provide important insights into the status of this little known species in Sumatra. We recommend that the large volume of camera-trap data from other Sumatran landscapes be used for an island-wide assessment of the clouded leopard population, to provide up-to-date and reliable information for guiding future conservation planning.

AB  - This study assesses habitat suitability and identifies conservation priority areas for the endangered Marco Polo sheep throughout Khunjerab National Park (Pakistan) and Tashkurgan Natural Reserve (China). We analyzed species occurrence records against environmental variables (elevation, slope, climate, land cover) using MaxEnt modeling. Model performance was validated through AUC-ROC analysis and response curves, generating spatial predictions of suitable habitats to inform conservation strategies. Spatial predictions were generated to map potential distribution zones, aiding conservation planning for this endangered species. The model's predictive performance was evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, yielding an AUC of 0.919, indicating strong discriminatory capability. Elevation (43.9%), slope (25.9%), and September precipitation (15.9%) emerged as the most influential environmental predictors, collectively contributing 85.7% to the model. The total percentage contribution and permutation significance values were 98.6% and 77.8%, respectively. Jackknife analysis identified elevation (bio-1), slope (bio-7), hillshade (bio-2), and the maximum July temperature (bio-9) as the most significant factors influencing the distribution of Marco Polo sheep, Conversely, variables such as viewshade (bio-14), land cover (bio-3), and precipitation in August (bio-4) contributed a minimal gain, suggesting that they had little impact on accurately predicting species distribution. The habitat suitability map reveals varying conditions across the study area, with the highest suitability (yellow zones) found in the northern and western regions, particularly along the Wakhan Corridor ridgelines. The southern regions, including Khunjerab Pass, show predominantly low suitability, marked by purple zones, suggesting poor habitat conditions. The eastern region displays moderate to low suitability, with fragmented patches of green and yellow, indicating seasonal habitats. The survival of transboundary Marco Polo sheep remains at risk due to poaching activities and habitat destruction and border fence barriers. This study recommends scientific approaches to habitat restoration together with improved China-Pakistan cooperation in order to establish sustainable migratory patterns for this iconic species.

AB  - The antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) content of composted pig manure remains high, but little is known about the impacts of its use in agriculture soil. In this study, the effects of three types of biochar (corn straw biochar, bamboo charcoal, and pig manure biochar) and pig manure compost fertilizer on ARGs and bacterial community in agriculture soil were compared. It was discovered through pot experiments that the pig manure added with biochar compost will still introduce ARGs into the soil vegetable system. And applying fertilizer with low ARG abundance does not guarantee that the soil system will have low ARGs abundance following fertilization. Corn biochar compost will increase the abundance of pathogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas and Massilia) in soil. In addition, tetC, tetG, tetX, Sul1, sul3, and qnrS genes were positively correlated with pathogenic bacteria, posing a health danger to the environment. Bamboo carbon compost will increase the abundance of soil probiotics (Arenimonas), so bamboo carbon compost has more advantages. Our findings have significant implications for the low-risk utilization of pig manure and risk evaluation of pig manure composting fertilizer.

AB  - Predation risk is known to affect the spatial use of prey species, imposing a trade-off between feeding requirements and predation avoidance. As a result, prey species can leave high-quality forage areas to use sub-optimal, but safer, habitat patches, defined as "refuge areas." In this study, we describe changes in the spatial use of an introduced ungulate species, the Mediterranean mouflon Ovis aries musimon, following the recolonization (in 1996) of wolves Canis lupus into the Albergian Hunting Estate (Italian Western Alps). Since 1988, we monitored the mouflon population by spring counts from vantage points. We georeferenced all observations and recorded the size and structure of the spotted groups. Finally, we identified available refuges by selecting patches characterized by (i) the presence of rocks and (ii) high values of steepness and ruggedness. We found that mouflons significantly reduced the average distance from refuge areas over the years, with the yearly average distance from refuges being 56% lower after wolves recolonized the area (i.e., 93.8 +/- 32.1 vs. 213.1 +/- 40.9 m). The analysis of orographic parameters showed that mouflons used patches with higher values in elevation, slope, ruggedness, and a significant difference in all three parameters when comparing years pre and post wolf return. Both sexes were significantly affected, but ewes were particularly sensitive and selected patches closer to refuge areas (75.8 +/- 30.3 m) than males (131.0 +/- 53.6 m). Our results suggest that the presence of new predators can alter the distribution of an introduced species such as the Mediterranean mouflon, triggering the resurgence of anti-predation behavior.

AB  - The anaesthetic effectiveness of separate and combined eucalyptus Eucalyptus globulus and oregano Origanum vulgare essential oils (EO) were investigated in silver kob Argyrosomus inodorus and were compared with clove oil Eugenia caryophyllata. Argyrosomus inodorus adults (595.61 [SE 11.82] g) were exposed to three concentrations of oregano EO (OEO: 25, 50 and 100 mu l l(-1)), eucalyptus EO (EEO: 300, 500 and 600 mu l l(-1)), and their mixtures (12.5 mu l l(-1) OEO to 150 mu l l(-1) EEO; 12.5 mu l l(-1) OEO to 300 mu l l(-1) EEO; 25 mu l l(-1) OEO to 150 mu l l(-1) EEO), with each fish treated as a replicate. Fish were also exposed to 40 mu l l(-1) of clove oil (CEO), which acted as a control. The two EOs and their mixtures proved to possess anaesthetic capacity in A. inodorus. Anaesthesia induction time (seconds) decreased with increased concentrations, whereas the inverse was reported for the recovery response. Only OEO qualified as an ideal anaesthetic agent for A. inodorus, especially 25 and 50 mu l l(-1), as the anaesthesia induction times with these concentrations were less than 180 s and recovery was within 300 s. It seems that EEO could achieve greater anaesthetic effectiveness only at a higher concentration (600 mu l l(-1)) or when mixed with OEO (at 25 mu l l(-1) OEO to 150 mu l l(-1) EEO). This study introduces oregano as a promising anaesthetic in A. inodorus compared with clove oil and EEO. However, further evaluations are deemed necessary.

The galls were similar to those of horn gall disease of Ci. tenuifolium caused by Laurobasidium hachijoense (Laurobasidiaceae, Exobasidiales) on Hachijo Island, approximately 700 km north of Hahajima. Based on morphological observation and molecular analyses of ITS and LSU regions, the fungus isolated from the surface of the galls was identified as L. hachijoense. This is the first report of the horn gall disease of Ci. pseudopedunculatum.

AB  - Rangeland degradation is a persistent decline in the productivity of vegetation that supports wild or domestic herbivores. However, rangelands often exhibit highly variable climates and dynamic, resilient vegetation, making it difficult to discriminate between lasting degradation and natural variability. Here, we introduce a new and flexible index to distinguish management-driven rangeland degradation from the influence of environmental variability using freely available remote sensing-derived datasets. We use quantile regression forests to estimate the potential gross primary productivity as a continuous function of biophysical conditions including climatic, soil and topographic variables. The relative productivity index (RPI) is then defined as the ratio between observed and potential productivity in each grid cell and year. This provides a dynamic reference point against which variation in rangeland condition across space and through time can be quantified consistently within a single framework. We test the method in the arid and semi-arid rangelands of East Africa and compare its performance to three other widely used methods to distinguish management impacts from natural variability: rain use efficiency, local gross primary production scaling, and residual trend analysis. We show that our method outperforms existing approaches both in explaining spatial differences in productivity and in controlling for climatic variability through time. In combination with other remote sensing and field-derived metrics, the rangeland productivity index has the potential to become a valuable indicator for quantifying rangeland condition and supporting sustainable management and utilisation of these landscapes.

AB  - When several polyphagous herbivore species share a parasitoid, the tri-trophic interaction networks can be difficult to predict. In addition to direct effects, the parasitoid may influence the herbivore community by mediating indirect interactions among hosts. The plant species can also modulate the parasitoid preference for a specific host. One of the indirect effects is apparent competition, a negative interaction between individuals as a result of the action of shared natural enemies. Here, we focus on the interactions between the parasitoid Fopius arisanus (Braconidae) and two generalist fruit fly pests: Bactrocera dorsalis and Bactrocera zonata (Tephritidae). This parasitoid was introduced into La Reunion in 2003 to control populations of B. zonata and can also interact with B. dorsalis since its invasion in 2017. Our main objective is to characterize the tri-trophic interactions between F. arisanus, fruit fly and host plant species. We developed a long-term field database of fruit collected before and after the parasitoid introduction and after the B. dorsalis invasion in order to compare parasitism rate and fruit fly infestation for the different periods. In laboratory assays, we investigated how the combination of fruit fly species and fruit can influence the preference of F. arisanus. In the field, before the invasion of B. dorsalis, the parasitism rate of F. arisanus was low and had a little impact on the fruit fly infestation rate. After the B. dorsalis invasion, we observed an increase in parasitism rate from 5% to 17%. A bioassay showed that females of F. arisanus could discriminate between eggs of different fruit fly and host plant species. The host plant species preference changed in relation to the fruit fly species inoculated. Field observations and laboratory experiments suggest the possible existence of apparent competition between B. dorsalis and B. zonata via F. arisanus.

AB  - Biological manipulation, involving fish stockings, is commonly used to counteract the deterioration of submerged vegetation in eutrophic lakes. Nevertheless, the non-consumptive effects (NCEs) of stocked carnivorous fish are often overlooked. Using a controlled experimental system, we investigated the NCEs of a native carnivorous fish, snakehead (Channa argus), on two key biological factors, herbivore-dominated grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) and disturbance-dominated loach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus), influencing submerged plants growth. Additionally, we conducted a meta-analysis on predation risk and primary productivity. The results reveal that predation risk induces oxidative stress damage and affects grass carp growth. Non-significant changes in cortisol and glucose may be linked to predation risk prediction. Simultaneously, predation risk reduces fish feeding and disturbance behavior, relieving pressure on submerged plants to be grazed and disturbed, thereby supporting plant development. The presence of submerged plants, in turn, enhances loach activity and influences water body characteristics through negative feedback. Furthermore, the meta-analysis results indicate the facilitative effect of predation risk on primary producers. Our findings contribute to the understanding of biological manipulation theory. We demonstrate that the predation risk associated with introducing carnivorous fish can promote the growth of submerged plants through behaviorally mediated indirect effects. This highlights the potential utility of predation risk in lake restoration efforts.

AB  - Understanding the complexities of pasture responses (the overall seasonal gains or losses in herbage mass) under different environmental conditions is critical to the effective management of total grazing pressure, whether to achieve agricultural, cultural or biodiversity conservation outcomes. Whilst large-scale management programmes for kangaroos (Macropus spp. and Osphranter spp.) occur across much of south-eastern Australia, there is limited understanding of how such programmes influence the overall pasture response across different environmental contexts in the temperate environment. This study investigates the effects of potential grass productivity (measured as the growth of pasture protected from large herbivore grazing), initial herbage mass (measured as the attached, above-ground component of grass tussocks), kangaroo density (measured at the site scale) and season on the overall pasture response in plots dominated by six common grass types from south-eastern Australia. Using generalised additive mixed modelling, we demonstrate potential grass productivity (related to but not synonymous with grass palatability) to be the major predictor variable for pasture responses across all six grass types. Kangaroo density, either directly or via an interaction with initial herbage mass, was related to overall pasture responses for most grasses in spring and remained an important variable in favoured areas dominated by preferred Kangaroo Grass (Themeda triandra) and Redleg Grass (Bothriochloa macra) throughout the autumn survey period. Plots dominated by grazing-tolerant species, including wallaby grasses (Rytidosperma spp.) and Phalaris (Phalaris aquatica; an introduced pasture grass), showed marginally positive pasture responses under higher kangaroo densities, whilst plots with Wild Oats (Avena fatua; an introduced annual grass) and less preferred native spear grasses (Austrostipa spp.) showed no significant effect of kangaroo density on pasture response. Results support a context-specific mix of 'bottom-up' (resource-driven) and 'top-down' (consumer-driven) processes in temperate grassy ecosystems, highlighting the importance of considering landscape productivity, existing herbage mass and grass species composition when informing kangaroo management decisions.

AB  - IntroductionDeclining hunter populations across North America present wildlife management agencies with the prospect of declining revenues for wildlife conservation and management and the need for new tools to evaluate management strategies and predict future status of game species and hunters.MethodsHere we present a modeling framework and potential decision support tool for managers to link future hunter population dynamics to regulatory restrictiveness, prey abundance, and harvest success. Our hunter model is parameterized based on the authors' judgment and can be used for demonstration purposes. We simulated three scenarios of restricted harvest, moderate harvest and liberal harvest.ResultsOur simulations show that even though liberal harvest predicts higher cumulative license sales revenue, it corresponds with a slight decline in buck abundance over 10 years. In contrast, highly restrictive harvest corresponds with deer population growth, but a near collapse of hunter populations. Our model demonstrates that managers might face tradeoffs between managing for deer population abundance and hunting revenue and clarifies how these factors might affect decision making.DiscussionThe utility of our tool would be dependent on accessing data on hunter retention and recruitment, however, the strength of our paper is in highlighting a new way of thinking about and potentially addressing these potential tradeoffs. Further, these simulations demonstrate that these tools could be used to evaluate management strategies but also highlight uncertainties, establish research priorities, and potentially design an adaptive management framework.

AB  - Background and Aims Protection mutualisms involve plants receiving defence against herbivores from predators, such as ants and insectivorous birds, in exchange for food resources. Ants can reduce herbivory by actively patrolling plants with extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) or by tending trophobiotic insects that provide them with food rewards. Insectivorous birds also contribute to herbivore suppression but might simultaneously reduce ant activity through predation. Although both ants and birds can enhance plant performance, few studies have explored how the availability of multiple ant-associated resources influences herbivore suppression, or how bird predation on ants affects these ant-plant mutualisms. These gaps limit our understanding of the dynamics in complex multitrophic interactions.Methods We investigated how the availability of multiple food resources for ants and the predation exerted by insectivorous birds on ants influence the performance of the tropical shrub Banisteriopsis malifolia. To address this, we conducted two field experiments. The first manipulated the individual and combined presence of mutualistic ant resources (EFNs, myrmecophilous caterpillars and treehoppers). The second experiment manipulated the presence or absence of both ants and birds to assess their interactive effects. Plant performance was evaluated by measuring leaf herbivore damage, the number of fruits and fruit weight.Key Results Our findings show that B. malifolia plants offering a full complement of mutualistic food resources for ants, including EFNs and trophobiotic insects, experienced significantly lower leaf herbivory and higher fruit production in comparison to plants lacking these resources. Bird exclusion resulted in increased herbivore damage and reduced fruit output, with these negative effects being even more pronounced when both birds and ants were excluded.Conclusions Our findings highlight the complexity of multitrophic interactions in ant-plant mutualisms. They emphasize the importance of considering multiple trophic levels in plant defence strategies and underscore the cascading effects of predator interactions within natural ecosystems.

AB  - Relationships between sea urchins and noncrustose macroalgae are typically nonlinear, and an abrupt phase shift from a barren to a macroalgae-dominated state and vice versa happens when the sea urchin abundance exceeds a critical threshold. Here, we have used two mass mortality events as a natural experiment to study progressive changes and dynamics between these stable states. In 2009-2010 and 2018, two mass mortalities decimated the populations of the sea urchin Diadema africanum in the Canary Islands (Eastern Subtropical Atlantic). In these islands, this sea urchin is a key-herbivore controlling the growth of macroalgae, and sea urchin barrens have persisted for more 60 yr. Mass mortality events differed in intensity both in space and time, and two phase shifts from sea urchin barrens to macroalgal beds were detected in both when sea urchin density declined below a critical threshold of 4 indv. center dot m(-2). The first mass mortality was greater in La Palma Island, consequently in this island a long-lasting alternative state dominated by noncrustose macroalgae has been established. Subsequently, a recurrent mass mortality also favored the transition from the sea urchin barrens to noncrustose macroalgal beds in Tenerife Island. After mass mortalities, D. africanum populations were reduced by 94-98% in both islands. No signs of recovery of these populations have been identified after phase shifts; ecosystem feedbacks may be the cause of the low population density of D. africanum.

AB  - Over the past three decades, white-tailed deer management in the eastern USA has largely shifted from maximum sustained yield to quality deer management (QDM), focusing on increasing the abundance of mature males. However, the spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD) introduces challenges to cervid management for wildlife agencies. The CWD management framework necessitates rapid shifts in harvest strategies, often targeting reduction of the demographic which spreads CWD in most - mature males. We investigated how hunter adherence to QDM related to perceptions of CWD and the CWD management framework. We surveyed 9,713 deer hunters in Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio, and South Carolina and found that perceptions of QDM were related to perceptions of CWD; specifically, hunters who were experienced with and supportive of QDM showed more concerns of CWD impacts on human and deer health. Our findings aid wildlife agencies in balancing conservation decisions with public perceptions of wildlife diseases and management frameworks.

AB  - Herbivorous insects have evolved counteradaptations to overcome the chemical defences of their host plants. Several of these counteradaptations have been elucidated at the molecular level, in particular for insects specialized on cruciferous host plants. While the importance of these counteradaptations for host plant colonization is well established, little is known about their microevolutionary dynamics in the field. In particular, it is not known whether and how host plant diversity shapes diversity in insect counteradaptations. In this study, we examine patterns of host plant use and insect counteradaptation in three Pieris butterfly species across Japan. The larvae of these butterflies express nitrile-specifier protein (NSP) and its paralogue major allergen (MA) in their gut to overcome the highly diversified glucosinolate-myrosinase defence system of their cruciferous host plants. Pieris napi and Pieris melete colonize wild Brassicaceae whereas Pieris rapae typically uses cultivated Brassica as a host, regardless of the local composition of wild crucifers. As expected, NSP and MA diversity was independent of the local composition of wild Brassicaceae in P. rapae. In contrast, NSP diversity correlated with local host plant diversity in both species that preferred wild Brassicaceae. Both P. melete and P. napi revealed two distinct major NSP alleles, which shaped diversity among local populations, albeit with different evolutionary trajectories. In comparison, MA showed no indication for local adaptation. Altogether, MA appeared to be evolutionary more conserved than NSP, suggesting that both genes play different roles in diverting host plant chemical defence.

AB  - Soil microbiota can either slow down or facilitate plant invasions through their effects on plant performance. Associations with soil microbiota can also modify other plant traits such as herbivore resistance, which can indirectly affect the outcome of plant introductions. We studied the effects of soil microbiota on the perennial herbaceous legume Lupinus polyphyllus that hosts nitrogen-fixing mutualistic bacteria. We compared the plant performance, herbivore resistance and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of plants from native (North American) and invasive (Finnish) populations of the species that were inoculated with intact or autoclaved soil from an invasive population. We found that plants of both origins greatly benefited from the intact soil inoculum with respect to all performance measures considered, suggesting that beneficial nitrogen-fixing rhizobia in the soil play a major role in shaping plant phenotypes. For three traits, effects of the intact soil inoculum were stronger in plants of native origin than in plants of invasive origin (number of leaves, herbivore resistance and total biomass). With the intact soil inoculum, plants of invasive origin were more resistant to snails than plants of native origin. Strikingly, differences in resistance to snails between plants of different origins disappeared entirely when soil microbes were reduced. Soil inoculum treatment altered the composition of the leaf VOC bouquet similarly regardless of plant origin. Synthesis. These results demonstrate the ability of Lupinus polyphyllus to associate with and benefit from putatively novel soil microbiota including rhizobia, which has likely contributed to its invasion success. Furthermore, it appears that the invasive populations have adapted to be less reliant on their symbionts, which further facilitates species spread. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that differences in herbivore resistance between native and invasive plant populations of the same species can depend entirely on soil microbiota.

AB  - Interventions to improve productivity in pastoral livestock systems of northern Kenya focus on the management of the rangeland resources and grazing areas with few initiatives on changes related to the livestock assets. However, changing climatic conditions with high frequencies of droughts have increased the vulnerability of pastoral communities and necessitate prompt interventions in animal management practices. In 2018, the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Irrigation in collaboration with the International Livestock Research Institute commenced a programme to build the resilience of pastoral holdings using their animal assets rather than depending on humanitarian emergency responses. Interventions necessitated changes in management practices related to sheep and goat production. Core innovation groups (CIG) each comprising 30 pastoral households in select communities were established to model new practices for wider adoption using participatory processes in Isiolo, Marsabit and Turkana Counties. CIG members went through a 3-year phased training programme on animal management practices for more efficient, resilient and productive animals. The adoption of new practices in CIG flocks was monitored by extension personnel. Data were analysed using logistic regression techniques to assess household-level adoption of livestock breed improvement, feeding and disease control interventions. The 3 years of the programme (2018-2021) were relatively satisfactory in terms of pasture availability; hence, communities pursued strategies to enhance their flocks. All CIG adopted more than one of the introduced technologies concurrently. Prevention of diseases was the most readily adopted, followed by crossbreeding using indigenous breeds of sheep and goats from other arid areas of Kenya. Turkana County had the lowest probability of adopting any of the technologies as previous devastating droughts have resulted in an increased emphasis on animals for survival rather than productivity. The study shows that pastoral communities are open to technological interventions for animal productivity. Adoption of the technologies was enhanced by the experiential capacity development activities adapted to the education level of the different communities.

AB  - To mitigate the decline of the Arabian Gazelle (Gazella arabica) in Oman, captive breeding centres and reintroduction programmes have been established. A key requirement for their success is a clear understanding of the species' genetic diversity and taxonomic status. We therefore analysed the genetic diversity of three captive populations in Oman. Genetic profiles of 65 gazelles were assessed using mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb), the control region (CR), and seven nuclear microsatellite markers. Interspecific comparisons based on phylogenetic analyses and median-joining networks of cytb (610 bp) confirmed that all gazelles studied in Oman belong to G. arabica. Some of the haplotypes are shared with other populations from the Arabian Peninsula. Intraspecific analyses of the first hypervariable region of the CR (299 bp) revealed high levels of both nucleotide and haplotype diversity across all three captive populations. Pairwise FST comparisons based on CR sequences indicated genetic homogeneity among populations, whereas microsatellite markers suggested weak to moderate genetic differentiation. Our results indicate high genetic diversity and genetic connectivity in the Omani Arabian Gazelle captive populations. Thus, the three captive populations represent a valuable source for reintroductions and breeding programmes in Oman.

AB  - The island rule, a general pattern of dwarfism in large species to gigantism in small species on islands relative to mainland, is typically seen as a macroevolutionary phenomenon. However, whether the ecological processes associated with abiotic and biotic factors generate a pattern of plant size variation similar to the island rule remains unknown. We measured plant height for 29,623 individuals of 50 common woody plant species across 43 islands in the Zhoushan Archipelago (8500 years old and yet to undergo major evolutionary adaptation) and the adjacent mainlands in China. We found pronounced variations in plant height, similar to those of the island rule. Interestingly, islands with low resource availability, such as low soil organic matter content and low precipitation, had a high degree of dwarfism; islands experiencing high environmental stress, such as high soil pH, had a high degree of dwarfism; and islands experiencing less plant-plant competition had a high degree of gigantism. The magnitude of plant dwarfism was higher on small and remote islands than on larger and nearer islands. These results highlight the importance of ecological processes associated with abiotic and biotic conditions in shaping the island rule-like patterns of plant size variation. Since our studied archipelago is too young to undergo major evolution, ecological processes likely played a prominent role in generating the observed pattern, challenging the notion that the evolutionary process is the dominant factor underlying the island rule. Future studies on the island rule need to perform experiments to disentangle evolutionary from ecological mechanisms. Copyright (c) 2024 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Identifying and quantifying the main factors that are jeopardizing amphibian communities worldwide is essential for planning effective amphibian conservation. We collected data on the presence/absence of salamanders and newts (Caudata) and frogs and toads (Anura) in >3600 water points from a large region (30,000 km(2)) in NW Spain during a 10-year period (2004-2013). We contrasted a large set of hypotheses explaining presence/absence as a function of anthropogenic factors across the regional elevation gradient (1-2036 m). Logistic regression modeling revealed that salamanders and newts were mainly influenced by pollution and by land use changes, and that the effect of these factors changed with elevation. However, frogs and toads were affected by a larger set of factors acting synergistically, although not including land use changes, and their effect operated at all elevation ranges, except in the case of biological factors (invasive species and wild boar abundance) with higher effects at low elevation. Changes in land use was the most common factor at any elevation and included the abandonment of rural areas, which favors shrub and tree encroachment on former open land, and loss of water points. The most resilient species at any elevation were two frogs, Pelophylax perezi and Rana parvipalmata. The least resilient species were two salamanders, Chioglossa lusitanica and Lissotriton helveticus, followed closely by two toads, Alytes obstetricans and Pelobates cultripes. Unoccupied sites had higher frequencies of biological effects and of changes in land use in the first 5 years of study and lower frequencies of direct human influence factors in the second period. Overall, our results showed that the studied amphibian metacommunity was negatively influenced both by direct and indirect anthropogenic factors, but also that many amphibian species were not only capable of occupying sites which had been altered by human action, but were even favored by land uses generating open habitat, a habitat type that is increasingly uncommon in the region, in the entire Iberian Peninsula and in Europe.

AB  - Invasive plants may display age or genotype-specific defenses against herbivory. Thus, the importance of herbivory for preventing or mitigating plant invasions may depend on genetics and age-structure of invader populations. We used an excised-leaf experiment to test whether constitutive herbivore defenses in Butomus umbellatus L. (flowering rush) plants decline with age between colonizing (1st year) and established (2nd year) plants and whether the decline was parallel between introduced diploid and triploid genotypes. Leaves from colonizing and established plants were fed to the generalist herbivore fall armyworm (FAW; Spodoptera frugiperda) and then short-term FAW development was measured. Additionally, leaf dry matter content (DMC), % carbon (%C), % nitrogen (%N), carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio, and total leaf phenolics were determined for leaves from a subset of test plants. FAW fed leaves from diploid plants grew 27 % less than those fed leaves from triploid plants but were only 1 % smaller when fed leaves from second-year versus first-year plants of either cytotype. DMC of diploid leaves was 11 % greater overall (11 % DMC) but the difference in cytotypes depended on age (1 % difference in colonizing plants vs. 21 % difference in established plants). In general, diploid plants were characterized by 29 % higher total phenolics, 17 % less leaf nitrogen, and 21 % higher C:N ratio, regardless of age. Measured traits were, on average, 27 % more variable for diploid than triploid plants, possibly a reflection of increased genetic diversity of diploid flowering rush populations used in the study. These results demonstrate that diploid B. umbellatus plants are, overall, better defended against generalist herbivory than triploid plants. Differences in herbivore performance on B. umbellatus lineages, and to a lesser extent plants of varying ages, may therefore contribute to spatial or temporal heterogeneity in the dominance of genotypes in areas where they grow together.

AB  - Nineteen red deer areas in a densely populated region with a huge network of fenced motorways and the division into administrative management units (AMUs) with restricted ecological connectivity were investigated. In the season 2018/2019, a total of 1291 red deer samples (on average 68 per area) were collected and genotyped using 16 microsatellite markers. The results show a clear genetic differentiation between most of the AMUs. Fourteen AMUs may be combined into four regions with a considerable internal genetic exchange. Five areas were largely isolated or showed only a limited gene flow with neighbouring areas. Ten of the 19 AMUs had an effective population size below 100. Effective population sizes greater than 500-1000, required to maintain the evolutionary potential and a long-term adaptation potential, were not achieved by any of the studied AMUs, even when AMUs with an appreciable genetic exchange were aggregated. Substantial genetic differentiation between areas can be associated with the presence of landscape barriers hindering gene flow, but also with the maintenance of 'red deer-free' areas. Efforts to sustainably preserve the genetic diversity of the entire region should therefore focus on measures ensuring genetic connectivity. Opportunities for this goal arise from the establishment of game bridges over motorways and from the protection of young male stags migrating through the statutory 'red deer-free' areas.

AB  - Sheep are among the earliest domesticated livestock species, with a wide variety of breeds present today. However, it remains unclear how far back this diversity goes, with formal documentation only dating back a few centuries. North European short-tailed (NEST) breeds are often assumed to be among the oldest domestic sheep populations, even thought to represent relicts of the earliest sheep expansions during the Neolithic period reaching Scandinavia <6,000 years ago. This study sequenced the genomes (up to 11.6X) of five sheep remains from the Baltic islands of Gotland and & Aring;land, dating from the Late Neolithic (similar to 4,100 cal BP) to historical times (similar to 1,600 CE). Our findings indicate that these ancient sheep largely possessed the genetic characteristics of modern NEST breeds, suggesting a substantial degree of long-term continuity of this sheep type in the Baltic Sea region. Despite the wide temporal spread, population genetic analyses show high levels of affinity between the ancient genomes and they also exhibit relatively high genetic diversity when compared to modern NEST breeds, implying a loss of diversity in most breeds during the last centuries associated with breed formation and recent bottlenecks. Our results shed light on the development of breeds in Northern Europe specifically as well as the development of genetic diversity in sheep breeds, and their expansion from the domestication center in general.

AB  - Aim It is generally assumed that the degree of resource specialization in herbivorous insects increases towards lower latitudes. However, latitudinal patterns in herbivore diet breadth at large spatial scales remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigated the drivers of latitudinal variation in lepidopteran 'fundamental' resource specialization, which we defined as the host breadth when not limited by interspecific interactions at the same trophic level. Location The Japanese archipelago (22 degrees N-45 degrees N), including hemiboreal, temperate and subtropical zones. Taxon Herbivorous butterflies. Methods Species-specific fundamental host breadth was calculated based on pooled host-use records. We investigated the latitudinal pattern and significant drivers of the degree of specialization in regional species pools at a 10-km grid level. As potential drivers, we focused on geography, current climate and diversity and body size of butterflies. Through Bayesian structural equation modelling, we investigated the complicated relationships between these variables and community-level resource specialization represented by three different indices of host breadth. Results We found that the fundamental resource specialization of butterfly communities increases towards higher latitudes. This pattern is contrary to the presumed general trend found in studies based on realized resource specialization within local communities. We found that the observed pattern is driven mainly by factors related to climate, butterfly diversity and body size in each community. Above all, annual mean temperature most strongly drove community-level fundamental host breadth of herbivorous butterflies. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that the fundamental resource specialization may show different latitudinal patterns from the conventional prediction based on knowledge of realized resource specialization. Our results emphasize the importance of the current climate as a major factor regulating butterfly morphology and fundamental host breadth, regardless of whether the impact is direct or indirect.

AB  - As biodiversity loss outpaces recovery, conservationists are increasingly turning to novel tools for preventing extinction, including cloning and in vitro gametogenesis of biobanked cells. However, restoration of populations can be hindered by low genetic diversity and deleterious genetic load. The persistence of the northern white rhino (Ceratotherium simum cottoni) now depends on the cryopreserved cells of 12 individuals. These banked genomes have higher genetic diversity than southern white rhinos (C. s. simum), a sister subspecies that successfully recovered from a severe bottleneck, but the potential impact of genetic load is unknown. We estimated how demographic history has shaped genome-wide genetic load in nine northern and 13 southern white rhinos. The bottleneck left southern white rhinos with more fixed and homozygous deleterious alleles and longer runs of homozygosity, whereas northern white rhinos retained more deleterious alleles masked in heterozygosity. To gauge the impact of genetic load on the fitness of a northern white rhino population restored from biobanked cells, we simulated recovery using fitness of southern white rhinos as a benchmark for a viable population. Unlike traditional restoration, cell-derived founders can be reintroduced in subsequent generations to boost lost genetic diversity and relieve inbreeding. In simulations with repeated reintroduction of founders into a restored population, the fitness cost of genetic load remained lower than that borne by southern white rhinos. Without reintroductions, rapid growth of the restored population (>20-30% per generation) would be needed to maintain comparable fitness. Our results suggest that inbreeding depression from genetic load is not necessarily a barrier to recovery of the northern white rhino and demonstrate how restoration from biobanked cells relieves some constraints of conventional restoration from a limited founder pool. Established conservation methods that protect healthy populations will remain paramount, but emerging technologies hold promise to bolster these tools to combat the extinction crisis.

AB  - ContextTopographic ruggedness has been examined in thousands of ecological studies and is a popular variable for characterizing habitat selection. Despite widespread adoption, ruggedness metrics are often applied uncritically and require systematic and thorough testing using both artificial landscapes and real-world applications.ObjectivesIn this paper we introduce a technique that removes the correlation of topographic ruggedness with curvature in order to more accurately represent fine-scale surface ruggedness.MethodsWe test our modified version of several ruggedness metrics against traditional ruggedness metrics using three ideal ruggedness criteria in artificial landscapes. We further tested our modified ruggedness measures using 449 real mountain ranges in Nevada, USA. Using desert bighorn sheep as a case study, we tested both modified and uncorrected ruggedness measures and slope in a multiscale context in order to examine habitat selection by female bighorn sheep.ResultsThe modified versions of the metrics passed all three criteria of the ideal ruggedness test and was able to accurately capture surface ruggedness. Modified versions of ruggedness differed from uncorrected versions by containing fewer highly rugged cells along ridgelines and drainages. Habitat relationships of desert bighorn sheep with ruggedness were scale-dependent, such that female sheep selected for steep slopes at fine spatial scales and ruggedness at moderate spatial scales.ConclusionsWe demonstrate that there are three components to ruggedness: elevation variation, aspect diversity, and surface ruggedness representing first, second, and third generation ruggedness indices. Our technique for removing underlying topographic variation provides an improved mapping of surface ruggedness and augments the other two generations of ruggedness metrics.

AB  - The larval period is a critical stage for many aquatic organisms, because larvae are small, fragile, and have high mortality rates. Amphidromous fish spend their larval stages in the sea, and larval durations vary, possibly reflecting their dispersal tendencies. The genus Rhinogobius (suborder Gobioidei) is widely distributed throughout Asia and exhibits a variety of migratory patterns. Despite some studies of their migratory histories, larval durations of Rhinogobius species are uncertain. This study used analyses of otolith microstructure and trace-elemental chemistry to investigate habitat use throughout the life history of R. nagoyae. Twenty-six adult gobies were collected from seven rivers on Sado Island, in northern Japan, and otolith Sr : Ca ratios were quantified using electron microprobe analysis to infer amphidromous movement. All individuals showed shifts in Sr : Ca ratio across the otolith transect, which indicated movement between freshwater and saltwater. Marine larval duration was estimated by otolith increment counting, combined with Sr : Ca ratio. Larval duration ranged from 29 to 45 days (mean, 35.3), and there were no significant differences among rivers on the island. The relatively short larval duration of R. nagoyae, compared with other amphidromous fish such as ayu and galaxids, may reflect environmental factors such as island size, cool weather or species characteristics.

AB  - Many large marine species are vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures, and substantial declines have been documented across a range of taxa. Many of these species are also longlived, have low individual resighting rates and high levels of individual heterogeneity in capture probability, which complicates assessments of their conservation status with capture-mark-recapture (CMR) models. Few studies have been able to apply CMR models to whale sharks Rhin-codon typus, the world's largest fish. One of their aggregation sites off Mafia Island in Tanzania is characterised by unusually high residency of this Endangered species, making it an ideal target for CMR methods. Three different CMR models were fitted to an 8 yr photo-identification data set to estimate abundance, population trend and demographic parameters. As anticipated, resighting rates were unusually high compared to other aggregations. Different CMR models produced broadly similar parameter estimates, showing a stable population trend with high survivorship and limited recruitment. Tagging and biopsy sampling for concurrent research did not negatively affect those sharks' apparent survival or capture probabilities. Scenario-based power analyses showed that only pronounced abundance trends (+/- 30%) would be detectable over our study period, at a 90% level of probability, even with the relatively high precision in yearly abundance estimates achieved here. Other, more transient whale shark aggregations, with reduced precision in abundance estimates, may only be able to confidently detect a similar trend with CMR models after 15-20 yr of observations. Precautionary management and long-term monitoring will be required to assist and document the recovery of this iconic species.

AB  - Natural forest regeneration is slow in abandoned continental Mediterranean cropland due to several abiotic and biotic factors. We aim at assessing the rates and limiting factors of woodland recovery following passive and assisted restoration of cropland by combing observational, quasi-experimental and experimental approaches. We quantified spontaneous plant recruitment, particularly of holm oak (Quercus ilex), after (1) 46 years of cropland abandonment and (2) 1-2 years of halted plowing in field strips with and without planted hedgerows and with introduced perches for birds, and (3) the effects of the protection with tree shelters of 1-2-year-old oak seedlings spontaneously established. The recruitment rate at the old-field plots was 2 oaks ha-1 yr-1 only. Field strips with planted hedgerows favored the spontaneous recruitment of oaks (rate was 22.7 ind. ha-1 yr-1) compared to unplanted strips (7.8 ind. ha-1 yr-1) hinting to the attraction of dispersers. Perches favored the recruitment of bird-dispersed species only in the long term provided they were fenced (up to 224 ind. ha-1 yr-1). Protection of oak seedlings did not increase survival, pointing out that herbivory was not a limiting factor of their early establishment. We conclude that, in continental Mediterranean environments, (1) natural regeneration is a slow but efficient nature-based solution to produce multifunctional and resilient landscapes provided there are abundant, nearby seed sources and (2) the recovery of woody vegetation is speed up by hedgerows in the short term and by fenced perches in the mid- to long-term, leading to enhanced biodiversity of agroecosystems.

AB  - Acute anomalous ocean warming events, including marine heatwaves (MHWs), have significant effects on reproduction and survival of piscivorous seabirds. Additionally, MHWs have negative effects on seabird fish prey, exacerbating these consequences and resulting in population implications for seabirds. We evaluated the relative body condition of Pacific sand lance Ammodytes personatus, an important seabird forage species, in Haro Strait, a highly productive region of southern British Columbia, Canada. We compared body condition and length of fish cohorts that experienced the 2016 MHW year (MHW cohorts) with fish hatched during 3 subsequent post MHW years (2017-2019). Age-0 MHW cohorts had a seasonal decline in body condition in age-0 fish from 100% in the summer to 81% in the winter, while age-1 fish showed a decline from summer-fall highs of 93.5% to wintertime low of 79.5%. In comparison, post MHW cohorts had a winter body condition that was 2-4 times higher than their MHW cohorts. Similar to previous studies in Alaska during the MHW, age-1 fish failed to grow and reach the typical size that distinguishes them from age-0 fish. Poor sand lance condition and growth in winter may explain the ramifications of a warming ocean for top predators, including seabirds and Pacific salmon, which depend on these prey fish in Haro Strait. Our results support the idea that Haro Strait, which is influenced by estuarine circulation resulting in cooler temperatures than surrounding areas, serves as a climate refugium for sand lance populations in summer and provides buffering capacity to ocean climate warming events.

AB  - Water quality can be improved by fencing off streams from livestock. However, the remedial effect of fencing can fail as livestock trample near stream areas. Water samples were taken every 3-4 wk, and flow was monitored over time in a headwater stream from 2003 to 2019. In November 2005, the stream edge and an area near the stream used for wallowing by farmed red deer was fenced off and planted in native trees, shrubs, and grasses. Contaminant (nitrogen and phosphorus species, sediment, and the fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli) concentrations decreased after fencing until at least 2013 (55-84%). However, nitrate concentrations more than doubled owing to the use of a portion of the catchment for a grazed winter forage crop in 2013. Most concentrations remained low after fencing, but sediment concentrations slowing increased (3% yr(-1)), which was attributed to animal tracking near the fence line. The presence of stock in the catchment enriched stormflow losses but prevented losses during baseflow. These data indicate that, when implemented well, fencing and planting could potentially sustain good water quality for decades in farmed red deer systems.

AB  - We investigated intraerythrocytic Babesia parasites in 21 Japanese wild boars, Sus scrofa leucomystax, captured in Wakayama Prefecture on the mainland from 2008 to 2009 and in 31 Japanese wild boars from 2011 to 2013 in Kochi Prefecture on Shikoku Island, Japan. We detected small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) gene (SSUrDNA) fragments of a Babesia species in 17 boars from Wakayama and 18 boars from Kochi. The nearly full SSUrDNA sequence (1669 bps) of this species was determined. A FASTA search revealed that the SSUrDNA sequence of the Babesia sp. in Japanese wild boars was the most homologous to those of several Babesia isolates reported as Babesia gibsoni. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Babesia sp. found in Japanese wild boars was the closest relative to B. gibsoni but made a different clade from B. gibsoni. The Babesia sp. in Japanese wild boars was completely different from Babesia sp. Suis found in a European domestic pig, Sus scrofa domesticus. By microscopic examination, ring-shaped, oval and pear-shaped small sized intraerythrocytic parasites were observed on blood smears of 12 of 18 Japanese wild boars whose blood smears could be examined in Wakayama. We also detected SSUrDNA fragments of a Hepatozoon species in 6 of the 21 wild boars from Wakayama. The nearly full SSUrDNA sequence (1774 bps) of the Hepatozoon sp. was shown to be identical to that of Hepatozoonapri.

AB  - Marking activity is important for intraspecific communication of carnivorans, and brown bear ( Ursus arctos L.), in particular. Marking, together with olfactory and visual signals, contribute to the spatial distribution of individuals, reduces the likelihood of unwanted encounters with representatives of same and other species, informs about the social status of individuals, facilitates the meeting of sexual partners during the rut, and accomplish the functions of territorial protection. Bears mainly choose trees as marking objects. To study brown bear communication system is important for understanding natural population processes whose disruption caused by human activities requires targeted conservation measures. The study site was located in the Vostochny Reserve on the eastern coast of Sakhalin Island (50 degrees 30'-50 degrees 42'N, 143 degrees 33'-143 degrees 42'E) in 2010-2012. The study area is characterized by mountainous relief with dark coniferous taiga as the dominant plant formation. We described 218 bear marking trees along routes in the basins of the Vengeri and Pursh-Pursh rivers and registered tree species and its trunk diameter, forest type, and terrain. To compare marking trees with unmarked, but available for bears' marking, we described all unmarked trees (n = 1479) within a 10 m radius from the marking trees, indicating their species and diameter. We registered and measured fresh (of the current year) and old signal marks on the trees: rubbing sings, debarking, and bear bites (See Fig. 1) and scratches. Brown bear pedal marks near marking trees were also registered. We found five species of trees marked by brown bears: Sakhalin fir ( Abies sachalinensis F. Schmidt) Mast.) ( See Fig. 2 ), Ayan spruce ( Picea ajanensis (Scibold & Zucc.) Carriere), Cajander larch ( Larix cajanderi Mayr), goat willow ( Salix caprea L.), and Erman's birch ( Betula ermanii Cham.). Most of the marking trees were Sakhalin fir (84.4% of all marking trees), which, according to the selection analysis were the only species preferred by bears (Jacobs' index = 0.23; see Fig. 3 ). Brown bears preferred to mark trees with a larger trunk diameter than available in the environment (average 29 and 25 cm, respectively; W = 191904; p < 0.001; see Table 1 ). Among the marking trees 90% were alive. Among the fresh marking signs on a marking trees rubbing signs were the most often (45.4%) and located at a height of 20 to 268 cm. The debarking of the current year was registered on 7.8% of marking trees, and the maximum damage height was 341 cm. Fresh bear claw scratches were on 35.2% of the marking trees. The average upper limit of scratches was 222.9 cm, with a maximum of 390 cm. Fresh bear bites were on 13.8% of the tree trunks, ranging up to a height of 321 cm. Many marking trees are permanent for bears and used annually; some of those are used most intensively. Repeated marking of the same objects by different individuals over a long period of time makes them communication centers of brown bears at the population level. We found bear pedal marks (depressions in the ground left by the bear's paws) around nine trees. They comprised 5-25 holes from paw prints. The nature of the marking signs left by the bears had similar features to those in the other parts of the species' area. Most of the marking trees (89.4%) were located in the floodplains and on the terraces, the rest were on the slopes of different exposure. Bears marked trees in the forests dominated by Sakhalin fir (73.9%), less often with dominance of Cajander larch (12.5%), Erman's birch (7.
   4%), Ayan spruce (5.1%), and in floodplain deciduous forests (1.1%). The vast majority of marking trees were located on bear trails (210 trees, 96.3%). The location of marking trees along the trails increases the effectiveness of trees involved in animals' communication activities, facilitating their detection. The marking complexes included two trees (27 times), three trees (10 times), four trees (5 times), five trees (2 times), and six and seven trees (1 time). The linear frequency of tree marking by bears on forest trails was 3.2 trees per 1 km. Such density of marked objects is relatively high, which is due to the relatively low anthropogenic pressure on the Reserve territory. The relative density of marking trees varies from site to site and depends on the bears number, the availability of trees suitable for marking, trails, anthropogenic pressure, and other factors. The frequency of tree -marking is a parameter that can be successfully used in determining the relative population density of brown bear and monitoring of its population state.

AB  - Pinus radiata (radiata pine or Monterey pine) is threatened in its native range in California and, at the same time, one of the most widely-planted tree species worldwide, especially in the southern hemisphere. It is affected by a wide range of plant-feeding insects both in its native range and in regions where it is planted as an introduced tree. In addition, there are many invasive insects that have colonised P. radiata, in some cases causing major damage. Here, our objectives were to provide a complete and up-to-date over-view of all insect species recorded from P. radiata worldwide, to summarise where these insects are native and which countries or regions they have invaded, to categorise them according to their impacts as dam-aging species or as vectors of plant pathogens, and to examine border interceptions to determine whether pathways exist that would allow these species to enter and potentially invade additional regions. Our com-pilation of insects feeding on P. radiata provides a list of 649 species (and an additional 11 species identi-fied at the genus level only). Coleoptera is the most represented order in the list (299 species), followed by Lepidoptera (224 species) and Hemiptera (65 species). We classified 28 species as high-impact, including 12 true bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), eight Lepidoptera, five other Coleoptera, two Hymenoptera and one Hemiptera. These species can cause substantial direct damage or act as vectors of highly-damaging plant pathogens. Other species cause only occasional damage, rarely requiring man-agement (classified as 'low-medium impact') or they are generally benign ('negligible impact'). Hemiptera and Scolytinae have a high proportion of species established outside their native range. The Nearctic and Neotropic regions have been invaded by the most high-impact species, mainly by species native to Europe. Border interceptions of 185 species (29% of those on our list) were recorded during import inspections between 1995-2021, indicating considerable potential for further invasions. The findings of our study can be used to identify potential high-impact invaders and the pathways that may require more phytosanitary attention. Furthermore, our analyses provide useful insights into the insect-plant interactions resulting from the global distribution of a tree species and the native and non-native insects feeding on it.

AB  - Dietary DNA metabarcoding enables researchers to identify and characterize trophic interactions with a high degree of taxonomic precision. It is also sensitive to sources of bias and contamination in the field and laboratory. One of the earliest and most common strategies for dealing with such sensitivities has been to remove all low-abundance sequences and conduct ecological analyses based on the presence or absence of food taxa. Although this step is now often perceived to be necessary, evidence of its sufficiency is lacking and more attention to the risk of introducing other errors is needed. Using computer simulations, we demonstrate that common strategies to remove low-abundance sequences can erroneously eliminate true dietary sequences in ways that impact downstream inferences. Using real data from well-studied wildlife populations in Yellowstone National Park, we further show how these strategies can markedly alter the composition of dietary profiles in ways that scale-up to obscure ecological interpretations about dietary generalism, specialism, and composition. Although the practice of removing low-abundance sequences may continue to be a useful strategy to address research questions that focus on a subset of relatively abundant foods, its continued widespread use risks generating misleading perceptions about the structure of trophic networks. Researchers working with dietary DNA metabarcoding data-or similar data such as environmental DNA, microbiomes, or pathobiomes-should be aware of drawbacks and consider alternative bioinformatic, experimental, and statistical solutions.

AB  - Purpose: Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL; Batten disease) are a group of rare inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by mutations in one of 13 ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal (CLN) genes. The diseases share a common set of symptoms, including motor and cognitive dysfunction, progressive loss of vision, and seizure activity. A naturally occurring model of CLN5 NCL exists in New Zealand Borderdale sheep, which exhibit similar clinical disease and post-mortem pathology to the human disease. Recent trials of concurrent intracerebroventricular and intravitreal gene therapy in sheep with CLN5 disease confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of this approach. Given the documented natural history of brain volume changes, detected by MRI, in sheep with CLN5 disease, the current study sought to utilize MRI as both a longitudinal readout and cross-sectional measure of therapeutic efficacy in treated sheep. Method: Sheep treated at a pre-symptomatic timepoint underwent five T1-weighted structural MRI scans between 5 and 18 months of age. Sheep treated at early and advanced symptomatic disease stages underwent a single MRI at 18 months of age. All scans from treated sheep were compared to historical healthy control and affected untreated sheep at each age. Finding: Pre-symptomatic treated sheep showed growth in intracranial volume at a comparable rate to healthy control sheep over the course of the study. Whilst grey matter volume decreased and cerebrospinal fluid volume increased in treated sheep, this was to a much smaller degree than in untreated affected sheep. The majority of the cortical regions assessed showed stable volumes over the course of the study, with the notable exception of the cerebellum. Both early and advanced symptomatic treated sheep showed intracranial volumes comparable to untreated affected sheep at 18 months of age. However, when individual tissue types were assessed, grey and white matter were significantly larger, and cerebrospinal fluid was significantly smaller in early symptomatic sheep compared to untreated affected sheep, while the same volumes in advanced symptomatic treated sheep were comparable to untreated affected sheep. Cortical regions assessed showed an age-at-treatment and dose effect.

Cortical regions assessed showed an age-at-treatment and dose effect. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated that MRI, a clinically relevant outcome measure, can be successfully utilized to assess therapeutic efficacy in a large animal model of CLN5 NCL, both in a longitudinal study and a cross-sectional study when robust natural history data is available for comparison.

AB  - Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) populations in the western United States have undergone widespread declines and extirpations since the late nineteenth century as a consequence of introduced diseases, competition with livestock, and unregulated hunting. Washington, Idaho, USA, and British Columbia, Canada were historically thought to be occupied by 2 bighorn lineages or subspecies: Rocky Mountain (O. c. canadensis) and California (O. c. californiana). The putative California lineage was completely extirpated in the United States, and reintroductions to reestablish populations were sourced directly or indirectly from a single region in southern British Columbia. Restoration efforts have attempted to maintain the diversity and divergence of these 2 lineages, sometimes referred to as subspecies although taxonomic classifications have changed over time. In this study we describe genetic variation in a subset of native and reintroduced herds of California and Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep. We examined genetic diversity and divergence between bighorn sheep herds using 15 microsatellite loci, including 4 loci linked to genes involved in immune function. We analyzed 504 samples from reintroduced herds in Washington (n = 10 California herds, n = 4 Rocky Mountain herds) and Idaho (n = 5 California), and source herds in Oregon (n = 1 Rocky Mountain) and British Columbia (n = 5 California, 1 Rocky Mountain). Genetic structure reflected known reintroduction history, and geographic proximity also was associated with decreased genetic divergence. Herds in Washington and Idaho sourced from California bighorn sheep were less genetically diverse than those sourced from Rocky Mountain herds. Also, levels of relatedness within and across California herds were higher than in Rocky Mountain herds and similar to what would be expected for full and half siblings. Lower diversity and higher relatedness among California herds is a concern for long-term fitness and likely related to past population bottlenecks, fewer source populations, and management history, such as entirely sourcing California herds from British Columbia. Genetic divergence of neutral loci between California and Rocky Mountain herds was greater than that of adaptive loci, potentially indicating that balancing selection has maintained similar genetic diversity across lineages in loci associated with immune and other adaptive functions. Thus, we recommend future reintroductions and augmentations should continue to use source populations from the appropriate California or Rocky Mountain lineage to avoid potential outbreeding depression and maintain possible adaptive differences. This could be accomplished by obtaining sheep from >= 1 source within the genetic lineage, while avoiding sourcing from admixed herds. Future work encompassing a broader geographic sampling of populations and a greater portion of the genome is necessary to better evaluate the degree to which contemporary divergence between lineages is associated with recent founder effects and genetic isolation or evolutionary adaptation.

AB  - The conservation and spatial management of marine species with limited adult mobility, such as queen conch, is dictated by larval connectivity. Effectively placed reserves provide larval spillover to harvested areas while replenishing their own population. In past studies proximate to the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park (ECLSP), surveys and probabilistic larval transport modeling demonstrated a spillover effect from the ECLSP to surrounding fished areas, while suggesting that incoming larval sources are lacking. Previous work was expanded in both upstream and downstream directions, enabling the statistical examination of (1) how queen conch abundance was linked to predicted larval transport from breeding populations in the ECLSP and (2) how age and size changed throughout the island chain as divided by management and connectivity. Biophysical modeling predictions of larval transport from breeding within the ECLSP were significantly associated with the relative abundance of juvenile conch observed across a nearly 200-km span. Further, the abundance and shell lip thickness (relative age) of adults and the size of juveniles were significantly larger in ECLSP than unprotected areas. This empirical support for an effective, well-enforced marine reserve and for using biophysical larval transport modeling as a spatial planning tool should be strongly considered in conch conservation and management.
   Dive surveys of queen conch confirm an earlier prediction of imbalanced connectivity in a marine reserve system. New evidence further supports a downstream population subsidized by a marine reserve and the extrication of upstream breeding sources. Conservation action is urgently needed before the senescing reserve population disappears. image

AB  - Prey populations significantly influence the distribution of top predators. The sika deer (Cervus nippon), a key prey species for the Amur tiger in Northeast China, plays a critical role in the recovery and dispersal of Amur tiger populations. Reintroduction is a pivotal strategy for restoring prey populations, but it presents challenges, especially in terms of adaptation to the natural environment during the natural training process before animals are released. In this study, we sampled six adult and six sub-adult sika deer and employed high-throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene to investigate changes in gut microbial diversity, composition, and function during natural training. The results showed that adult sika deer had higher gut microbiota diversity compared to sub-adults. However, as natural training progressed, the gut microbial diversity in sub-adults approached that of adults. Additionally, beneficial, fiber-digesting bacteria associated with adaptation to the natural environment tended to increase during nature training in both adult and sub-adult sika deer, while pathogenic bacteria tended to decrease. We also compared the metabolic function of the gut microbiota in adult and sub-adult sika deer, which showed that the carbohydrate metabolic function of both adults and sub-adults decreased significantly with natural training, declining more rapidly in sub-adults. Conversely, the lipid metabolic function in sub-adults increased significantly with natural training. Overall, a period of nature training is necessary before reintroducing animals to their natural habitats, and sub-adult sika deer, in particular, exhibit greater adaptability to environmental changes as reflected by their gut microbiota dynamics. These findings offer valuable insights for the reintroduction of sika deer and other ungulates. We recommend incorporating natural training in reintroduction programs and prioritizing sub-adult animals for reintroduction.

AB  - Knowledge of the role of individual associations has provided an insightful understanding of the structures of animal societies, especially in highly social mammals such as primates. Yet, this is unbalanced towards marine mammals, particularly to beaked whales, due to their elusive nature. In addition, information on the fundamental drivers of the social structure of these deep-diving animals is still scarce. Here, the hypothesis of female defence polygyny was tested in Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) and discussed within the context of marine and terrestrial organisms displaying similar patterns, by (i) estimating residency times to obtain information on the movements into and out of the area, (ii) analysing social networks to assess individual association metrics, (iii) measuring the strength of the associations to assess the existence of preferred or avoided relationships among individuals, and (iv) modelling different social structures to address temporal patterns in social relationships. Using a 9-year photographic dataset derived from the pelagic habitat, individual associations were inferred based on likelihood techniques. This approach allowed to infer on the species' social structure in relation to age class, sex, residency status, and spatio-temporal patterns, which can be a good practice to be applied for other taxa. Heterogeneity in capture probability and residency times was observed between age-sex classes, with adult females exhibiting long-term site fidelity. This suggests different habitat roles and spatial structuring within this social organisation. Strong and long dyadic associations occurred between adult females and immatures, contrarily to between males, and the best-fitting models of the temporal patterns suggested long-lasting and temporary associations. The present findings unravel a complex social structure stratified by age-sex class and influenced by female philopatry and defence polygyny, like an unimale group mating system, which varies from other beaked whales but is similar to some birds, pinnipeds, or non-human primates.

AB  - The Mycoplasma Immunoglobulin Binding/Protease (MIB-MIP) system is a candidate 'virulence factor present in multiple pathogenic species of the Mollicutes, including the fast-growing species Mycoplasma feriruminatoris. The MIB-MIP system cleaves the heavy chain of host immunoglobulins, hence affecting antigen-antibody interactions and potentially facilitating immune evasion. In this work, using -omics technologies and 5'RACE, we show that the four copies of the M. feriruminatoris MIB-MIP system have different expression levels and are transcribed as operons controlled by four different promoters. Individual MIB-MIP gene pairs of M. feriruminatoris and other Mollicutes were introduced in an engineered M. feriruminatoris strain devoid of MIB-MIP genes and were tested for their functionality using newly developed oriC-based plasmids. The two proteins are functionally expressed at the surface of M. feriruminatoris, which confirms the possibility to display large membrane-associated proteins in this bacterium. However, functional expression of heterologous MIB-MIP systems introduced in this engineered strain from phylogenetically distant porcine Mollicutes like Mesomycoplasma hyorhinis or Mesomycoplasma hyopneumoniae could not be achieved. Finally, since M. feriruminatoris is a candidate for biomedical applications such as drug delivery, we confirmed its safety in vivo in domestic goats, which are the closest livestock relatives to its native host the Alpine ibex.

AB  - Karst cave investigations in the south of Haida Gwaii have opened a small window on human and paleontological components of the early post-glacial landscape. At three cave locations (K1, Gaadu Din 1 and Gaadu Din 2) our investigations recovered a paleontological record extending from ca. 13,400 to 11,000 years ago and a small number of human artifacts dating from ca. 12,600 to 11,000 years ago. The animal bones recovered are dominated by black and brown bear remains, revealing that these caves were being used for winter dens. Other species present include deer, caribou, and salmon. Domestic dog remains with a direct radiocarbon age of 13,100 years ago are the earliest indicator of human presence from the cave assemblages, and are also the earliest known domestic dog remains reported on in the Americas. Brown bear and deer disappear from the paleontological record at the end of the Pleistocene, but other species persist into the Holocene, most of which continue to thrive on the islands to this day, with the exception of caribou which were extirpated in the early 20th Century. The stone tools that we found are predominately spearpoints and fragments thereof, which were used to hunt denning bears. Additional stone tool types from the Gaadu Din Caves reveal that they were occasionally used by humans as temporary shelters. As sea level was lower than today between 13,400 and 11,000 years ago, the caves provide an alternative target for late Pleistocene archaeological prospection that does not involve subtidal work. Our research demonstrates that karst caves on Haida Gwaii provided ecological and cultural focal points during the early post-glacial period. These caves remained sufficiently stable to preserve the residues of activities including bear denning and bear hunting. With the commencement of the Holocene, the record of animal and human use of the three caves diminishes. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil extracellular enzyme stoichiometry (EES) and microbial metabolic limitation deeply reflect soil quality. However, knowledge about the impacts of different grazing intensities on microbial metabolic limitation has not been well-documented. Herein, the influences of four sheep grazing intensities (ungrazed, UG; lightly grazed, LG; moderately grazed, MG; and heavily grazed, HG) on microbial metabolic limitation were investigated in typical steppe (14-year grazing) and desert steppe (17-year grazing). The activities of an extracellular enzyme (EEAs) involved in soil C, N, and P transformation were determined by fluorimetric microplate assay. We found that different grazing intensities significantly affected extracellular enzyme activities and EES. Compared to the treatments of UG, LG, and MG, microbial relative C limitation in the HG treatment increased by 30.5-64.7% and 18.9-33.1%, respectively, in typical and desert steppes, indicating that heavily grazing aggravated soil microbial relative C limitation. Moreover, along with grazing intensity, vector angle decreased from 50.3 degrees to 27.6 degrees and from 71.5 degrees to 58.9 degrees in desert steppe and typical steppe. This indicated that the pattern of microbial metabolism limitation shifted from P limitation to N limitation in desert steppe, and heavily grazing significantly aggravated microbial N limitation in desert steppe. In addition, the desert steppe was more pronounced than the typical steppe to grazing intensity increasing. Therefore, heavily grazing aggravated microbial metabolism limitation, deteriorated grassland quality. The outcomes of this study highlight that lightly grazing can be an effective management practice to maintain grassland ecological services in semi-arid areas from the perspective of soil microbial metabolic limitation.

AB  - With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, vehicle-mounted mobile monitoring systems have become increasingly integrated into wildlife monitoring practices. However, images captured through these systems often present challenges such as low resolution, small target sizes, and partial occlusions. Consequently, detecting animal targets using conventional deep-learning networks is challenging. To address these challenges, this paper presents an enhanced YOLOv7 model, referred to as YOLOv7(sr-sm), which incorporates a super-resolution (SR) reconstruction module and a small object optimization module. The YOLOv7(sr-sm) model introduces a super-resolution reconstruction module that leverages generative adversarial networks (GANs) to reconstruct high-resolution details from blurry animal images. Additionally, an attention mechanism is integrated into the Neck and Head of YOLOv7 to form a small object optimization module, which enhances the model's ability to detect and locate densely packed small targets. Using a vehicle-mounted mobile monitoring system, images of four wildlife taxa-sheep, birds, deer, and antelope -were captured on the Tibetan Plateau. These images were combined with publicly available high-resolution wildlife photographs to create a wildlife test dataset. Experiments were conducted on this dataset, comparing the YOLOv7(sr-sm) model with eight popular object detection models. The results demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP), with YOLOv7(sr-sm) achieving 93.9%, 92.1%, and 92.3%, respectively. Furthermore, compared to the newly released YOLOv8l model, YOLOv7(sr-sm) outperforms it by 9.3%, 2.1%, and 4.5% in these three metrics while also exhibiting superior parameter efficiency and higher inference speeds. The YOLOv7(sr-sm) model architecture can accurately locate and identify blurry animal targets in vehicle-mounted monitoring images, serving as a reliable tool for animal identification and counting in mobile monitoring systems. These findings provide significant technological support for the application of intelligent monitoring techniques in biodiversity conservation efforts.

AB  - Context Reduced connectivity across grassland ecosystems can impair their functional heterogeneity and negatively impact large herbivore populations. Maintaining landscape connectivity across human-dominated rangelands is therefore a key conservation priority. Objective Integrate data on large herbivore occurrence and species richness with analyses of functional landscape connectivity to identify important areas for maintaining or restoring connectivity for large herbivores. Methods The study was conducted on a landscape with a mosaic of multiple land uses in Laikipia County, Kenya. We used occupancy estimates for four herbivore species [African elephant (Loxodonta africana), reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata), plains zebra (Equus quagga), and Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi)] and species richness estimates derived from aerial surveys to create resistance surfaces to movement for single species and a multi-species assemblage, respectively. We validated single-species resistance surfaces using telemetry data. We used circuit theory and least cost-path analyses to model linkage zones across the landscape and prioritize areas for connectivity restoration. Results Resistance layers approximated the movements of our focal species. Results for single-species and multi-species connectivity models were highly correlated (r(p) > 0.9), indicating similar spatial patterns of functional connectivity between individual species and the larger herbivore assemblage. We identified critical linkage zones that may improve permeability to large-herbivore movements. Conclusion Our analysis highlights the utility of aerial surveys in modeling landscape connectivity and informing conservation management when animal movement data are scarce. Our results can guide management decisions, providing valuable information to evaluate the trade-offs between improving landscape connectivity and safeguarding livelihoods with electrified fences across rangelands.

AB  - The management of international students has become a new challenge that China and most countries in the world must face in the context of the "Belt and Road Initiative" (BRI) and the globalization of higher education. In this paper, we conducted an empirical study on international students in China (ISC) based on a combination of spatial econometric models and analytical methods such as BCG, GeoDetector, and DDCAM, trying to provide a basis for "evidence-based decision-making" by the government in the management of international students and talents. Quantitative analyses revealed significant diversity and spatial effects in the spatio-temporal dynamics of ISCs, with the emergence of star, gazelle, cow, and dog types, suggesting that the scientific management of ISCs requires both local adaptation (spatial differentiation and heterogeneity) and regional collaboration (spatial correlation and autocorrelation). There were many factors affecting the spatio-temporal dynamics of ISCs, and the force of different factors varied considerably, with the key factor more than 0.5 but the auxiliary factor being less than 0.2. Moreover, the factors had significant interaction effects, and a large number of super-interacting factor pairs emerged, with a joint force of more than 0.9, twice the force of a single factor. Generally, the factors had a complex driving mechanism, suggesting that ISC management requires identifying the key and important factors, while attaching emphasis to the synergistic effects among different factors. The recommendation is that China should manage ISCs in spatial zones and introduce differentiated development strategies and policies in different zones. In conclusion, this paper proposes a technical route integrating "dynamic analysis-driving mechanism-policy design" for international students, which is applicable to China, while providing a reference for the management and spatial planning design of international students in other countries in the world.

AB  - Globalization has led to a significant increase in the establishment of forest plantations with exotic species and to the accidental introduction of forest insects worldwide. Cumulatively, these factors contribute to the increased occurrence of novel associations between phytophagous insects and trees, leading to new interactions between species that have not historically co-occurred. Here, we reviewed the patterns of novel associations between herbivorous insects and pines and eucalypts at a global scale and identified factors that could favor the occurrence of novel associations and their impacts on forestry. We recorded 766 novel associations of insects with pines and 356 with eucalypts, involving 852 species of herbivorous insects. Most of the novel associations occurred in the Neotropic, Austro-Pacific, and Palearctic regions. In all biogeographic regions, novel associations involved mostly native insects on exotic trees, except for the Nearctic, where exotic insects were dominant. Generalist insects were more frequently involved in novel associations, but specialist ones caused higher damage levels. Foliage feeders and wood and phloem feeders were the most frequent feeding guilds involved in new associations, while sap feeders, shoot feeders, and fruit and seed feeders were rare. For pines, non-native insects were more frequently associated with trees phylogenetically related to hosts in their native range, and native insects were more frequently associated with unrelated hosts. However, for both exotic and native insects, novel associations with eucalypts primarily involved hosts that are unrelated to hosts in their native range. The significance of extensive forest plantations with non-native species and the biogeographic context are emphasized as factors associated with the occurrence of novel associations between insects and trees. This study highlights the importance of international collaboration in forest insect monitoring and surveillance programs to facilitate the early detection of novel associations as an important first step toward minimizing their impact.

AB  - Over one-third of elasmobranch fishes (sharks, rays, and skates) are threatened with extinction, mostly due to overfishing, habitat loss, and habitat degradation. Understanding the daily and seasonal movement patterns of these species can inform when and where populations are most susceptible to these threats, but these data are often lacking for nearshore species that are not actively managed. Two such species are the shovelnose guitarfish Pseudobatos productus and California bat ray Myliobatis californica; this study quantified the broad- and fine-scale movement patterns of these species using passive acoustic telemetry. Twelve guitarfish (10 female, 2 male) were surgically implanted with coded acoustic transmitters at an aggregation site off La Jolla (San Diego County), California, USA, and tracked for 849.5 +/- 548.9 d (mean +/- SD). Six bat rays (all female) were also implanted with transmitters and tracked for 1143.8 +/- 830.9 d. These animals were detected at 187 acoustic receiver stations between Point Conception, California, and San Quintin, Baja California, Mexico. Both species exhibited annual philopatry to La Jolla, especially in July, after traveling as far north as Santa Barbara (221 km away; guitarfish) and San Miguel Island (259 km away; bat rays), California. Based on their movement patterns and known reproductive phenology, we hypothesize that both species utilize the La Jolla aggregation site as a gestating ground and possibly also a mating, pupping, and nursery ground. This site is within a no-take reserve, and we recommend that similar sites also be protected, given the increased susceptibility to anthropogenic stressors when aggregating.

AB  - New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri) are expanding in numbers and distribution throughout New Zealand. The exception is the West Coast of the South Island, where there is documented decline due to decades of mortalities related to fishery. There are fur seal colonies south of these West Coast colonies, in Fiordland, which have never been accurately documented or monitored. Even for those that are documented, there are few records of pup numbers and no population estimates. Here, pups at colonies from Doubtful/Patea, Dusky, and Breaksea Sound, and Chalky Inlet were observed, and their numbers either counted directly or estimated using mark-recapture methods in February 2021. From these pup counts a coarse minimum population estimate of between 14-24 thousand fur seals is calculated for lower Fiordland. The pup counts and population estimates indicated the fur seal numbers are higher than previously recorded from estimates of walk through, boat or helicopter observations. During onshore surveys and from anecdotal evidence, it was noted that fur seals were rearing pups in forested areas. This paper outlines suggestions for the future monitoring of these colonies given, location, diverse geology and the difficulty of monitoring colonies on exposed west coast areas of New Zealand's Fiordland.

AB  - Host and pathogen dynamics are driven by seasonal variation, leading to complex epidemic patterns which are not well understood. Here, we linked demography and epidemiology in a single framework to reach a mechanistic understanding of disease dynamics in natural populations characterized by seasonality. We applied this approach to depict the interplay between a host, the wild boar, and a viral disease, African swine fever. This virus spreads in wild boar by direct-contact among living individuals or though contacts with infected carcasses. In this system, both host and pathogen show seasonal patterns: survival and reproduction probabilities vary across the year in the wild boar, and virus persistence in the environment is affected by temperature which influences the speed of carcasses degradation. Using a stochastic individual-based model, we showed that virus invasion success strongly varies according to the time of introduction due to the seasonal specific interaction between the virus and host. Furthermore, the shape of the following epidemic varies across seasons, with variation in speed and magnitude of the outbreak. Consequently, the host population response was also season-specific, both regarding the speed of the decline and the change in population structure. Overall, our study highlights the inextricable connections between host, pathogen and the environmental dynamics, and the importance to consider each component to understand disease dynamics.

AB  - The cactus Leptocereus grantianus is an endangered species endemic to the island municipality of Culebra, Puerto Rico. Given its critical population status, several conservation and restoration actions have been developed to restore its dwindling populations. However, the limited understanding of its biology and ecology has constrained such efforts. Our project aims to enhance the knowledge of L. grantianus demography by monitoring survival, growth, and phenology in three natural populations. After one year, survival rates ranged from 70% to 100%. The observed mortality was linked to basal dislodgement, which resulted from an unstable substrate. Conversely, growth rates (net change in branch length) were low, with mean rates not exceeding 0.32 cm per month in any of the studied populations. Nevertheless, significant seasonal variations were observed, with 46% of individuals exhibiting a reduction in length during the dry season compared to only 11% during the wet season. Flower-budding occurred year-round in all populations; however, flowering and fruit production were rare. The observed low growth rate and reproductive output may be adaptive strategies to enhance survival in the harsh environmental conditions of Culebra. Therefore, conservation and restoration initiatives should incorporate these insights to effectively address the challenges faced by L. grantianus and support its recovery.

AB  - When wild-caught Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) from the Slovak Carpathian Mountains were reintroduced to Central Switzerland in the early 1970s and spread through the north-western Swiss Alps (NWA), they faced a largely unfamiliar landscape with strongly fragmented forests, high elevations, and intense human land use. For more than 30 years, radio-collared lynx have been monitored during three different project periods (in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2010s). Our study explored, how lynx over generations have learned to adjust to the alpine environment. We predicted that (1) lynx nowadays select more strongly for open habitats, higher elevations, and steep slopes compared to the early stages of recolonization and that (2) consequently, there were significant changes in the Eurasian lynx' prey spectrum. To test our predictions, we analyzed telemetry data (VHF, GPS) of 13 adult resident lynx in the NWA over 35 years, using Resource Selection Functions. Furthermore, we compared kills recorded from different individuals inhabiting the same region during three project periods. In general, lynx preferred forested areas, but over the years, they avoided open habitat less. Compared to the early stage of the recolonization, lynx in the most recent project period selected for higher elevations and the proportion of chamois in their prey spectrum surmounted that of roe deer. Potential driving factors for the observed changes could be increasing tolerance to human presence, intraspecific competition, or fitness benefits through exploitation of new resources. Long-term studies like ours provide important insight into how animals can respond to sudden environmental changes, e.g., in the course of translocations into new areas or anthropogenic alterations of their habitats.

AB  - Climate change is expected to significantly impact bird species through changes to breeding and survival. Malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) are threatened mound-building birds that persist in uncleared mallee and shrubland vegetation in semi-arid parts of southern Australia. Our aim was to understand the relationship between environmental factors and mound breeding activity (a proxy for population trends) to identify likely climate change impacts and possible proactive management actions. We compared annual activity at grids that encompassed groups of mounds at six sites in South Australia for up to 24 years with a range of environmental and habitat variables, focussing on variables predicted to change with a warming climate. Mound activity declined significantly over the study period at five of the six sites. Activity was positively associated with increased cumulative rain in the previous 2 years, lower average maximum temperatures in the winter, higher-than-average Southern Oscillation Index (i.e. more rain) 2 years before breeding and greater winter vegetation cover. These results suggest that moisture and vegetation cover are important for higher breeding activity. Climate change is predicted to lead to drier conditions and more frequent fires in our study region, suggesting that Malleefowl populations will continue to decline. We urge conservation practitioners to minimise climate change impacts through implementing proactive management actions that increase habitat quality for Malleefowl: fire management to reduce the scale of fire events and controlling introduced and overabundant native herbivores to preserve vegetation cover, retain soil moisture, increase food resources and protect from temperature extremes.

AB  - The reintroduction of the Mexican wolf in the wilds of northwestern Mexico has allowed us to address its trophic ecology and elucidate conflicts with livestock producers: their main mortality factor. Our objective was to determine the feeding habits of wolves in Mexico, as well as the quantity and frequency of livestock predation in relation to seasonal and individual variables, through the analysis of genetically identified scats. During 2012-2022 we collected 1171 Mexican wolf scats. We extracted and sequenced DNAm and identified individuals and their sex using microsatellite analysis. We washed the scat and separated the undigested components for taxonomic identification. We estimated the frequency of prey items, the biomass it contributed to the diet, and compared prey consumption between sexes and between the birth and dispersal seasons. We constructed generalized linear models to identify the relationship between livestock presence in the diet and dietary prey richness with respect to environmental and individual variables. We identified 68 wolves that had consumed 30 species of vertebrates. Of these, white-tailed deer (36.12%), diversionary feeding (22.79%), and cattle (25.56%) had the highest contribution to biomass. The ingestion of items was independent of the sex of the wolves but was dependent on the season. The presence of deer and diversionary feeding decreased the likelihood of cattle being ingested but also decreased the richness of items of wild species in the wolf diet. Wolves in northwestern Mexico fed mainly on large prey available in the reintroduction area, including livestock. As wolves consume livestock, it increases the risk of retaliatory actions from ranchers. Our results serve as a basis for the implementation of strategies to reduce human-wolf conflicts and set a baseline for coexistence in northwestern Mexico.

AB  - The rapid diversification of notothenioid fishes in Antarctic waters is a prime example of the process of adaptive radiation. Within around 10 million years, Antarctic notothenioids have diversified into over 100 species with a broad range of lifestyles and ecological adaptations. However, the exact number of species within this radiation has long been unclear. Particularly challenging is the taxonomy of the genus Channichthys, for which between one and nine species have been recognized by different authors. The putative species of this genus are known from a limited number of specimens, of which most were sampled decades ago. Here, we investigated the mitochondrial genomes of museum specimens representing the four species Unicorn Icefish (C. rhinoceratus), Red Icefish (C. rugosus), Sailfish Pike (C. velifer), and Charcoal Icefish (C. panticapaei), complemented by morphological analyses. All analyzed specimens were collected in the 1960s and 1970s and fixed in formaldehyde, and their DNA has been heavily degraded. Applying ancient-DNA protocols for DNA extraction and single-stranded library preparation, we were able to obtain sufficient endogenous DNA to reconstruct the mitochondrial genomes of one specimen per species. These mitochondrial genome sequences were nearly identical for the three specimens assigned to Unicorn Icefish, Red Icefish, and Sailfish Pike, while greater divergence was observed for the Charcoal Icefish specimens. We discuss possible explanations of the contrast between these molecular results and the recognizable morphological variation found among the four species, and recommend that at least the Charcoal Icefish be included in the list of valid notothenioid species.

AB  - Blister blight (BB) disease is caused by the obligate biotrophic fungal pathogen Exobasidium vexans Massee and seriously affects the yield and quality of Camellia sinensis. The use of chemical pesticides on tea leaves substantially increases the toxic risks of tea consumption. Botanic fungicide isobavachalcone (IBC) has the potential to control fungal diseases on many crops but has not been used on tea plants. In this study, the field control effects of IBC were evaluated by comparison and in combination with natural elicitor chitosan oligosaccharides (COSs) and the chemical pesticide pyraclostrobin (Py), and the preliminary action mode of IBC was also investigated. The bioassay results for IBC or its combination with COSs showed a remarkable control effect against BB (61.72% and 70.46%). IBC, like COSs, could improve the disease resistance of tea plants by enhancing the activity of tea-plant-related defense enzymes, including polyphenol oxidase (PPO), catalase (CAT), phenylalanine aminolase (PAL), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), & beta;-1,3-glucanase (Glu), and chitinase enzymes. The fungal community structure and diversity of the diseased tea leaves were examined using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal rDNA genes. It was obvious that IBC could significantly alter the species' richness and the diversity of the fungal community in affected plant sites. This study broadens the application range of IBC and provides an important strategy for the control of BB disease.

AB  - The brachyuran crabs Carcinus maenas and Hemigrapsus sanguineus belong to the most 'successful' invaders along the oceans coasts. In 2009, H. sanguineus appeared at the rocky intertidal of the island of Helgoland in the North Sea, where it encounters the native Green shore crab, C. maenas. H. sanguineus established a self-sustaining population, approaching in numbers and biomass that of C. maenas. Both species are considered to be opportunistic omnivores with variable food preferences and, thus, are potential competitors for food. To evaluate the intrinsic properties of either species to utilize food, we analyzed their stomach content, the morphology of the gastric mills, which shred the ingested food, the activities of digestive enzymes during a seasonal cycle, and the stable isotope ratios. A huge share of the stomach contents was macerated and, thus, could not be identified. The shares of animal food and algae food were almost equal in C. maenas but algae food dominated over animal food in H. sanguineus. The gastric mill of C. maenas shows blunt medial tooth and rounded lateral teeth, which indicates efficient grinding of a carnivorous diet. In contrast, the gastric mill of H. sanguineus shows sharp ridges, which facilitate cutting of algal food. The activities of the proteolytic enzymes trypsin and leucine-aminopeptidase were almost equal in both species with slightly higher activities in C. maenas in summer. The activities of the carbohydrases laminarinase and amylase dominated in H. sanguineus during all seasons. Stable isotope ratios indicate a higher degree of carnivory in C. maenas. The morphological and biochemical features indicate that C. maenas is better suited to utilize animal food and H. sanguineus algal food. Upon scarcity of animal food or severe competition with C. maenas, H. sanguineus may be able to increase the amount of algal food and to utilize it efficiently.

AB  - Simple Summary After several years of inappropriate management, the pasture inside the enclosure for captive red deer in Paneveggio Pale di San Martino regional Park (TN, Italy) lost its nutritional value, due to the expansion of unpalatable tall grasses. Therefore, several measures to restore a suitable pasture composition were needed. The mowing activity represents a disturbance for the captive deer, which negatively affects the animals' well-being. To establish the more appropriate times/days to perform activities inside the enclosure, we observed the alarm reactions and relative intensity of animals exposed to different visual stimuli presented inside and outside the enclosure. Some differences were highlighted between the males and the nursery (females and fawns) groups. Considering the deer biology and the studied location, the best months in which it would be possible to plan activities inside the enclosure are March, April (if the snow is not present) and August. Data elaboration suggests that the best day to perform activities inside the enclosure is Wednesday because the animals showed less sensitivity to disturbances; Tuesday and Thursday may also be considered additional suitable days. The study analyzes red deer responses to disturbances during the day and different exposures to tourists, to establish the more appropriate times to carry out activities inside the Paneveggio deer enclosure. The alarm reactions of red deer were observed after presenting different types of visual stimuli inside and outside the fence, in order to answer some questions: Which stimuli produce the strongest reactions from the animals? Do animals differently react to stimuli presented outside and inside the fence? On which days and times are the animals more sensitive to disturbances? Are there different reactions between the males and females? The results suggest that the red deer adversely react to the disturbance at different degrees of intensity in relation to day, sex, tourist and where the stimuli are presented. It was observed that during the days with the highest tourist presence, the animals were particularly alarmed; discomfort accumulation produced the highest number of alarm reactions on Monday. For these reasons, it would be opportune to manage the pasture on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, scheduled at specific times of day, preferably far from the estimated presence of tourists.

AB  - Current theory (e.g., consumer-controlled theory) predicts that nutrient enrichment typically amplifies herbivory and thereby suppresses the growth and expansion of invasive plants. Herbivores can facilitate plant regrowth in the native community by stimulating complementary growth or ameliorating habitat conditions (e.g., by increasing soil oxygen and nutrient availability), but whether they have similar positive effects on invasive plants, especially under nutrient enrichment, remains unknown. Using a field nitrogen (N)-enrichment x crab exclusion experiment, we evaluated and compared the effects of both N enrichment and crab herbivory on the growth performance of a global invasive cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, and a co-occurring native plant, Phragmites australis. We found that crabs consistently suppressed P. australis by density and aboveground biomass regardless of N enrichment. In contrast, for S. alterniflora, the negative effects of crabs under ambient N were replaced by positive effects under N enrichment, with crabs stimulating complementary increases in density and aboveground biomass. The differing effects between the N treatments were driven by crab burrowing activity, which increased soil N availability, and the nutrient-use efficiency of S. alterniflora. Our findings revealed that native herbivores can have opposing effects on native and invasive plants, which broadens our understanding of how exotic plants can achieve dominance in a changing world.

AB  - In Nigeria, Chromolaena odorata poses significant threats to agriculture by disrupting ecosystem structure and function, thereby altering ecosystem services. However, our understanding of its impact, potential uses, and control measures, particularly from the perspective of local communities who interact directly with the plant, presents opportunities for a balanced approach to sustainable management. The aim of this study was to document the knowledge and perceptions of the introduction and spread of C. odorata, its ethnopharmacological applications, and its effects on crops, livestock, and wildlife, as well as discuss control strategies. Using participatory rural appraisal techniques, we administered semi-structured questionnaires to 150 respondents across six villages in Edo State, Nigeria. The findings reveal that C. odorata is a well-recognized invasive species that has been present for several decades and is commonly referred to by its local name, "Awolowo weed". Although many respondents were unsure of the reasons behind its introduction, most were familiar with its mode of dispersal. A significant proportion of respondents view the weed as a serious threat to agriculture and a major hindrance to human movement by foot to and from their farmlands where C odorata is dominant. However, many also reported its relative ease of management. Interestingly, 92.7% acknowledged the medicinal value of C. odorata, citing its use in treating fever, wounds, and stomach aches, while 84% reported its ability to enhance soil fertility. Most respondents did not perceive the plant as harmful to livestock or wildlife. Though many believe that the plant has continued to spread, 83.8% oppose its complete eradication. Instead, they highlighted Elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach) as a more problematic weed that requires immediate intervention. In summary, exploring the local benefits of C. odorata highlights the importance of leveraging local knowledge and practices to develop a robust, integrated approach for its sustainable long-term management.

AB  - Biomass allocation is a key mechanism for understanding the response of alpine meadow plants to environmental changes. However, the two major theories of plant biomass partitioning, that is, optimal and equidistant allocation, are highly controversial. This study aimed to test these hypotheses by using the biomass allocation pattern of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau alpine meadows under different herbivore assemblages and enclosures and to identify the key physicochemical factors driving changes in biomass allocation. The results showed that fencing and grazing lead to the allocation of more biomass to roots and shoots, respectively. Additionally, our results support the optimal allocation hypothesis, which is mainly regulated by changes in soil physicochemical properties. Specifically, the trade-off between aboveground- and belowground biomass negatively correlated with the soil bulk density, soil moisture, available nitrogen, and available phosphorus but positively correlated with available potassium. In terms of biomass trade-offs, co-grazing yaks and Tibetan sheep at a 1:6 ratio with moderate grazing intensity may be a reasonable method to use and protect alpine meadows on the QinghaiTibetan Plateau.

AB  - Introduction and objective. Reports on tick-borne infections in free-living juvenile animals and their impact on survival of cervids in nature are lacking. The aim of the study was to detect and identify the Babesia and Anaplasma phagocytophilum species/ecotypes that may have contributed to the death of juvenile animals from a wildlife rescue centre in spring 2020.
   Material and methods. PCR amplification and sequencing of two genetic markers (18S rDNA and cox1 for Babesia, 16S rDNA and groEL for A. phagocytophilum) were used for screening eleven samples derived from juvenile animals which died in a rescue centre (seven roe deer Capreolus capreolus, one elk Alces alces, one red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris, one European beaver Castor fiber, one red fox Vulpes vulpes). Phylogenetic analysis of full-length 18S rDNA sequence was performed to enable differentiation between two closely-related species infecting wild ungulates, Babesia capreoli and Babesia divergens (zoonotic).
   Results. The occurrence of the typical SNPs of B. capreoli at two discriminating positions in the 18S rRNA gene allowed identification of B. capreoli infection in a roe deer calf. In two calves, Anaplasma phagocytophilum ecotype 2 was identified, including the same calf co-infection. No Babesia DNA was amplified in an elk calf treated for babesiosis. Splenomegaly was recorded in roe deer calves with A. phagocytophilum and A. phagocytophilum + B. capreoli infection.
   Conclusions. The study revealed that tick-borne infections are common among juvenile, free-living cervids and may contribute to their mortality.

AB  - Impediments that constrain animal movements across spatiotemporally heterogeneous landscapes can result in reduced or complete loss of access to critical resources. Across their range in North America, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) are exposed to fences that can affect their ability to permeate the landscape, access critical resources, and respond to climatic variations. Understanding pronghorn movement responses to fences is essential for improving landscape permeability; however, prior studies provide only limited insight due to lack of information on fence characteristics and small sample sizes. Our study used hourly collar locations from adult female pronghorn in six herds in Montana, USA, and identified encounters with mapped fences to evaluate three movement responses (i.e., probability of an unaltered initial response, probability of crossing following an altered initial response, and passage time following an altered initial response) as a function of fence and landscape attributes. Based on 5581 encounters identified from movement pathways of 265 collared pronghorn and 979 km of mapped fences, we found that variability in pronghorn fence response was correlated with fence type. Woven wire fences substantially reduced unaltered initial and crossing responses and increased passage times as compared with low (i.e., average lowest wire height < 41 cm) or high (i.e., average lowest wire height & GE;41 cm) strand fences. Both low and high strand fences elicited similar responses of being relatively permeable at the initial encounter with reduced permeability thereafter. Fence crossing probabilities following altered initial responses increased through time modestly for strand fences but only negligibly for woven wire fences, with passage times averaging approximately 14 h. Pronghorn knowledge of and fidelity to specific permeable locations along fences, which may be due to inconsistent fence and landscape characteristics along the fence stretch, likely allow some woven wire fences and most strand fences, regardless of the average lowest wire height, to be permeable. Improving landscape permeability for pronghorn should focus on removing woven wire fences, replacing woven wire fences with strand fences, and incorporating variation in the lowest wire heights into new fence designs or modifications of existing fences.

AB  - Livestock depredation by large carnivores is a global conservation challenge, and mitigation measures to reduce livestock losses are crucial for the coexistence of large carnivores and people. Various measures are employed to reduce livestock depredation but their effectiveness has rarely been tested. In this study, we tested the effectiveness of tall fences to reduce livestock losses to snow leopards Panthera uncia and wolves Canis lupus at night-time corrals at the winter camps of livestock herders in the Tost Mountains in southern Mongolia. Self-reported livestock losses at the fenced corrals were reduced from a mean loss of 3.9 goats and sheep per family and winter prior to the study to zero losses in the two winters of the study. In contrast, self-reported livestock losses in winter pastures, and during the rest of the year, when herders used different camps, remained high, which indicates that livestock losses were reduced because of the fences, not because of temporal variation in predation pressure. Herder attitudes towards snow leopards were positive and remained positive during the study, whereas attitudes towards wolves, which attacked livestock also in summer when herders moved out on the steppes, were negative and worsened during the study. This study showed that tall fences can be very effective at reducing night-time losses at corrals and we conclude that fences can be an important tool for snow leopard conservation and for facilitating the coexistence of snow leopards and people.

AB  - Guerrilla rewilding, the unsanctioned release of species into the wild, is a controversial activity criticized by most conservation professionals. In this Forum article we argue that despite this criticism, it has played a significant but underexplored role in the UK's rewilding movement. Using examples including butterfly species, goshawk Astur gentilis, wild boar Sus scrofa, beaver Castor fiber and lynx Lynx lynx, we argue that examining these guerrilla rewilding acts provides valuable insights into public preferences for certain species, their perceived acceptability, and the ways in which they shape knowledge and practices of human-wildlife coexistence. However, our analysis also suggests that in some cases guerrilla rewilding can undermine the very species it seeks to restore. Animals released without preparation or monitoring, particularly those habituated to human presence, often lack the ability to survive independently, leading to welfare issues, human-wildlife conflict and wider ecological impacts. Furthermore, by circumventing the social and collaborative dimensions of rewilding, these actions risk deepening divisions among stakeholders, which are critical to ensuring long-term success. Nonetheless, this type of rewilding can also potentially trigger more positive emotions of recovery whilst raising the species' profile. We find that guerrilla rewilding has in some cases influenced formal rewilding practice and the broader discourse in the UK, in stark contrast to the official government position on nature recovery. This paper draws together some key learning points and highlights areas for future research on guerrilla rewilding.

Yet, bat populations are declining worldwide primarily due to habitat loss and other anthropogenic stressors. Thus, studies on bat ecology, particularly on environmental determinants of bat occupancy, are paramount to their conservation. High mobility, nocturnal behavior, and roosting site selection of bats make conventional surveys challenging. Moreover, little is known about geographic distribution, habitat suitability, and responses to climate change among tropical bat species. To bridge these research gaps, we applied ecological niche modeling to two Ceylonese bat species, Kerivoula malpasi and Kerivoula picta, to map their geographic distribution. Seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation were critical environmental predictors of bat distribution in general. Southwestern lowland forests contained the most optimal habitats for the relatively wide-ranging Kerivoula picta, while the central highlands provided the most suitable habitats for the narrow-ranging Kerivoula malpasi. No tangible changes in the highly suitable habitats were evident in response to projected climate change for either species. Yet, the optimal ranges of K. malpasi can become fragmented in the future, whereas the most optimal habitats for K. picta are likely to become spatially contiguous in the future. Habitat availability or fundamental niche alone is insufficient to reliably forecast species persistence, thus we caution against considering these two bat species as resilient to climate change. Our findings will enable the conservation authorities to initiate preemptive conservation strategies, such as the establishment of landscape-scale habitat connectivity and management of buffer zones around conservation lands. We also encourage conservation authorities to employ ecological niche models to map potential species distributions and to forecast range shifts due to climate change.

AB  - China has a vast territory and abundant resources, and there are significant differences in the development of pig breeding in different regions. Chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) produced in the process of pig breeding will affect China's environmental quality. In view of this, based on the Minimum Distance to Weak efficient frontier model, this paper constructs Metafrontier-Malmquist-Luenberger (MML) index considering negative output under the common frontier to comprehensively evaluate the green total factor productivity of Chinese pig breeding (GTCP). This has guiding significance for improving China's pork production and reducing pollution emissions. The results manifest that (1) no matter under the common frontier or the group frontier, GTCP presents large temporal and spatial differentiation characteristics. Compared with the central region and the western region, the eastern region has obvious advantages in GTCP. (2) GTCP has shown an upward trend as a whole, which is mainly due to the technical progress. (3) Compared with small-scale and medium-sized GTCP, large-scale GTCP has apparent superiorities. Based on the above outcomes, this paper finally raises policy recommendations for improving GTCP: (1) give full play to the advantages of pig breeding in different regions, (2) increase the research and introduction of pig breeding clean technology and improve the application efficiency, and (3) give full play to the scale effect and vigorously develop large-scale pig breeding.

AB  - The paper presents the results of telemetry observations of movements of individuals of the European elk Alces alces (Linnaeus, 1758) received in the period from 2021 to 2023. Two males were released into the wild after accidentally entering anthropogenic sites in St. Petersburg. Additionally, one female was released into the wild after a prolonged (about two years) existence in captivity. The individuals were equipped with collars containing GPS/GSM transmitters. The calculated values of the individuals' movements for one hour, as well as the values of the diurnal path and diurnal displacement, are presented. In 75% of the cases, the observed individuals did not move more than 200 m per hour. The highest median values of the diurnal path and diurnal displacement for the adult male were observed in June (4369 m/1649 m), and the lowest in February (677 m/195 m). For other individuals, due to the short term of monitoring, values were calculated for the entire observation period and were 2015 m and 619 m for the adult female, respectively, and 4297 m and 1431 m for the yearling male. Movements of the adult male indicate seasonal sedentariness and consistent habitat use in summer. We identified 5 spatially distinct habitat periods associated with the seasonal behaviour of the individuals: the readaptation area after release into the natural environment, summer habitat areas, autumn-winter traveling area, winter habitat area and spring migration. Further, we estimated individual home ranges using different methods: the minimum convex polygon, kernel density estimation, local convex hull and concave polygon alpha shape. Minimum convex polygon home range sizes (100% locations) were: for the adult male - 66692 ha in 22 months; for the adult female elk - 33178 ha in one month; for the yearling male - 6978 ha in 3.5 weeks. A brief literature review summarises previously published similar measurements made in Russia, Scandinavia, Canada and the USA. A comparison of the calculated values with the literature shows territorial and sex-age differences in the aspect of elk movement in space, as well as methodological differences in the assessment of habitat characteristics.

AB  - During a survey of headwater springs in France, an unknown Staurosirella taxon was observed that could not be identified using the currently available literature. Based on light and scanning electron microscopy observations, the taxon is described as a new species: Staurosirella lucectoriana. The new species is characterised by small isopolar, elliptical frustules, with a very small apical pore field, composed of only a few pores on one valve pole. Staurosirella lucectoriana is typically found in waters with high nitrate concentrations. A detailed comparison with morphologically similar species is provided.

AB  - Bison (Bison spp) are being reintroduced into semi-wild, spatially constrained herds across North America and Europe. Herd managers are concerned about gastrointestinal (GI) nematode parasites as they care for the health of their bison. We examine how demographics, grazing location, herd management, and anthelmintic treatments affect the fecal egg counts (FECs) of GI nematodes within a reintroduced Plains bison (Bison bison bison) herd in the Great Plains. Our results suggest that younger bison (<2 years of age) experience higher GI parasite eggs/oocysts per gram (epg/opg) and that some taxa are more prevalent throughout different periods of a bison's early years. Demographic findings suggest that calf and yearling (0-2 yrs age) bison have the highest FECs and that these decline until reaching a low in peak adulthood and thereafter (x > 6 yrs of age). FECs of both Trichuris spp. and particularly Nematodirus spp. were much more abundant, relatively, during the first year of a bison's life. This pattern was also true of Moniezia spp. and Eimeria spp., however, strongyle-type spp. FECs appeared to peak in relative abundance during the second year of life. Our data also indicate that FECs are influenced by differences in land-use histories of pastures previously grazed by cattle or by the proportion of frequent flooding in different pastures. Treatment results suggest that fenbendazole may more effective than moxidectin at lowering FECs of bison over the long-term, and lasting effects of at least one administered anthelmintic treatment. Multiplex PCR assays revealed that American bison share GI nematodes with cattle including: Ostertagia spp., Haemonchus placei, Cooperia onchophora, and Oesophagostomum spp, but did not detect the presence Trichostrongylus columbriformis. Our results may have wider conservation implications for reintroduction efforts of American bison, as well as the endangered European bison (Bison bonasus).

AB  - Invasive alien mammals cause huge adverse ecological impact on human society and natural ecosystems. Although studies have estimated economic costs of mammal invasions at regional scales, there is lacking the large-scale comprehensive assessment of currency costs for this taxon. Here, we estimated the economic cost of invasive alien mammals on a global scale using the most comprehensive global database compiling economic costs of invasive species (InvaCost). From 1960 to 2021, mammal invasions caused costs (summing damage costs and management costs) of US$ 462.49 billion to the global economy, while the total amount of robust costs reached US$ 52.49 billion. The majority of the total economic costs corresponded to damage costs (90.27 %), while only 7.43 % were related to management cost. Economic costs showed an increasing trend over time. The distribution of costs was uneven among taxonomic groups and regions, with the global total cost highly biasing toward to 5 species (European rabbit, Domestic cat, Black rat, Wild boar and Coypu), and North America reporting much higher costs (60.78 % of total economic costs) than other regions. The total costs were borne by agriculture, environment, authorities stakeholders and other sectors. Geographic and taxonomic biases suggested that total economic costs caused by invasive alien mammals were underestimated. Integrated research efforts are needed to fill in knowledge gaps in the economic costs generated by mammal invasions and to identify the drivers of the economic costs.

AB  - Marine mammal populations worldwide greatly benefitted from conservation measures put in place since the 1970s following overexploitation, and many pinniped populations have recovered. However, threats due to bycatch, interspecific interactions or climate change remain, and detailed knowledge on vital rates, population dynamics, and their responses to environmental changes is essential for efficient management and conservation of wild populations. In this study, we quantified pup abundance and survival of individually marked harbour seal (Phoca vitulina Linnaeus, 1758) pups during the preweaning period at Bic Island and Metis sites in the St. Lawrence Estuary from 1998 to 2019. We used mark-recapture models to evaluate competing hypotheses regarding variation in daily preweaning survival rates and capture probability during the pups' first 30 days of life. Pup abundance increased from 76 [95% CI: 59, 101] to 323 [95% CI: 233, 338] in the past two decades at Bic Island and from 66 [95% CI: 47, 91] to 285 [95% CI: 204, 318] at Metis. Preweaning survival was generally higher at Bic (0.73 [95% CI: 0.58, 0.82]) than at Metis (0.68 [95% CI: 0.52, 0.79]). We hypothesize that differences between habitats and human disturbance contribute to lower preweaning survival at Metis, but behavioural studies are needed to understand the impacts of disturbance on mother-pup interactions during the nursing period.

AB  - Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), Steinernema riobrave and Heterorhabditis floridensis are under evaluation for eradication of the southern cattle fever tick, Rhipicephalus microplus infesting nilgai antelope, in South Texas. Cattle fever ticks are a significant threat to the U.S. livestock industry. Although they have been eradicated in the U.S. they frequently re-invade along the Texas-Mexico border. Remotely operated field sprayers have been developed to directly treat nilgai antelope with EPNs as they transit fence crossings and as they contact wetted foliage and soil from the surrounding area. EPNs are known to be susceptible to mortality from ultraviolet light (UV) and desiccation. A sprayable fire gel, Barricade (R), has been reported to protect EPNs from UV and desiccation but has not been tested on animal hides. Barricade (R) at 1 and 2 percent rates was mixed with the water solution of S. riobrave and H. floridensis and applied to cowhides (to mimic direct treatment of nilgai) and filter paper and then these substrates were placed out of doors in 0, 30, 60 or 120 min of sunlight. Wax moth larvae, Galleria mellonella, were exposed to the cowhides and filter paper to determine efficacy of the EPNs. Efficacy of S. riobrave with 1 and 2% Barricade (R) gel applied to cowhides was significantly improved at 30 and 60 min as compared to the control. At 120 min mortality of the wax moth larvae was near zero for both the control and the treatments. Similar results were found with the filter paper test. In contrast, efficacy of H. floridensis with Barricade (R) applied to cowhides or filter paper was not significantly improved at 30, 60 or 120 min as compared to the water only control. Barricade (R) has the potential to improve the efficacy of S. riobrave and other EPNs by reducing mortality and desiccation, especially when used in the remotely operated sprayer developed for treatment of cattle fever tick infested nilgai.

AB  - Spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula White; SLF) is a phloem-feeding planthopper invasive to the Eastern United States that can feed on a range of wild and cultivated plant species. Since its 2014 introduction in the United States, large infestations and subsequent economic damage have been reported in cultivated grapevines, but no studies have detailed grapevine physiological responses to SLF phloem feeding. This study investigated grapevine-SLF interactions, detailing how different infestation densities affect leaf gas exchange and end-season concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates and nitrogen in vegetative and perennial tissues of two Vitis species. Effects on fruit ripeness parameters and dormant bud freeze tolerance were examined, in addition to other year-after effects. Phloem feeding by low densities (<= 4 SLF shoot(-1)) had minimal effects, whereas greater densities (5-15 SLF shoot(-1)) increasingly affected carbohydrate and nitrogen dynamics in both Vitis species. Phloem feeding substantially affected starch and, to a lesser extent, total nitrogen concentrations of woody roots. Prolonged exposure strongly reduced leaf gas exchange. We conclude that intensive late-season phloem feeding by large adult SLF population densities (>= 8 SLF shoot(-1)) can induce carbon limitation, with the potential for negative year-after effects in cases of severe belowground carbon depletion. This work presents novel insights into SLF-grapevine interactions, identifies avenues of future SLF-plant research, and assists the development of action thresholds for SLF management in vineyards.

AB  - The feeding ecology of scarinine parrotfishes on tropical coral reefs has received considerable attention in the past few decades; nonetheless, relatively few studies have been conducted in high-latitude reefs. Among the Indo-Pacific Scarus species, Scarus ovifrons is unique, being largely restricted to the warm temperate waters of Japan. Nonetheless, there is very little information available on the feeding ecology of this species. In this study, the authors used acoustic telemetry to detect the diel vertical movement patterns of S. ovifrons, video survey to detect its feeding depths and substrata and focal follow survey and genetic analysis to identify algae composition on the feeding scars at Kashiwajima Island, southwestern Japan (32 degrees 46 ' N, 132 degrees 38 ' E). Acoustic telemetry revealed that S. ovifrons spent most of its time in shallow water (<10 m) during the day and slept in deeper water (10-15 m) at night. Video and focal follow surveys revealed that most fishes of various sizes regularly took bites on epilithic algae and detrital materials on rocky substrata at depths of <10 m, but large fishes (>40 cm total length) sometimes took bites directly on live corals (Acropora solitaryensis) at the 5 m depth zone where live tabular corals dominated the benthos. Molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed that epilithic algae collected from feeding scars were mainly composed of Rhodophyta, and coralline algae were less often targeted. Overall, this study revealed that S. ovifrons feeds mostly at depths <10 m, and the feeding algae substrata of the species are similar to those of tropical coral reef parrotfishes.

AB  - Many animal populations are subject to hunting or fishing in the wild. Detailed knowledge of demographic parameters (e.g. survival, reproduction) and temporal dynamics of such populations is crucial for sustainable management. Despite their relevance for management decisions, structure and size of exploited populations are often not known, and data limited. Recently, joint analysis of different types of demographic data, such as population counts, reproductive data and capture-mark-recapture data, within integrated population models (IPMs) has gained much popularity as it may allow estimating population size and structure, as well as key demographic rates, while fully accounting for uncertainty. IPMs built so far for exploited populations have typically been built as age-structured population models. However, the age of harvested individuals is usually difficult and/or costly to assess and therefore often not available. Here, we introduce an IPM structured by body size classes, which allows making efficient use of data commonly available in exploited populations for which accurate information on age is often missing. The model jointly analyzes size-at-harvest data, capture-mark-recapture-recovery data and reproduction data from necropsies, and we illustrate its applicability in a case study involving heavily hunted wild boar. This species has increased in abundance over the last decades despite intense harvest, and the IPM analysis provides insights into the roles of natural mortality, body growth, maturation schedules and reproductive output in compensating for the loss of individuals to hunting. Early maturation and high reproductive output contributed to wild boar population persistence despite a strong hunting pressure. We thus demonstrate the potential of size-class-structured IPMs as tools to investigate the dynamics of exploited populations with limited information on age, and highlight both the applicability of this framework to other species and its potential for follow-up analyses highly relevant to management.

AB  - Plants may produce induced defenses such as longer thorns or secondary compounds to cope with higher levels of herbivory. However, it is unclear if physical and chemical plant defenses increase incrementally along a gradient of herbivore densities. We hypothesized that physical and chemical anti-herbivore defenses in selected shrubs increase with increasing herbivore density. We tested our hypothesis using four 0.81 km2 paddocks on each of two ranches in southern Texas, USA, that were fenced to exclude ingress and egress by white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus). Target densities of deer on each ranch were 0 (control), 25, 49, and 74 deer/km2. Pelleted feed was provided ad libitum in each paddock. In July 2014, we selected ten plants of blackbrush acacia ( Vachellia rigidula), twisted acacia ( Vachellia schaffneri), and spiny hackberry ( Celtis ehrenbergiana) in each of the four research paddocks on each ranch. We marked stems on each plant and recorded length of the main stem, lateral stems, and thorns during July 2014-2016. We collected leaf and stem samples from 20 plants of each of the three browse species during July and October 2014 and 2015 for analysis of crude protein and tannins. Branch density of blackbrush acacia was 38 % (25 deer/km2) to 123 % (49 deer/km2) greater in deer density treatments and thorn density of blackbrush acacia was 27 % greater in treatments with 74 deer/km2 than in control treatments. Spiny hackberry branch density was 2.5 times greater in treatments with 49 deer/km2 than in control treatments. Induction of plant antiherbivore defenses with increasing deer density occurred primarily in blackbrush acacia. A key finding is that induced physical and chemical defenses in shrubs can respond to increasing herbivore density in a non-linear fashion and the combination of defense strategies can vary depending on herbivore density.

AB  - The critically endangered Mona Island iguana, Cyclura stejnegeri, is threatened by nest predation by feral pigs, invasive plants that reduce nesting area, and high juvenile mortality. Even though studies in the last 45 years have been sporadic, they had led to different management actions such as protecting nesting areas from feral pig incursion and expanding suitable nesting sites by eradicating the Australian pine (Casuarina equisetifolia) and other invasive plant species. In addition, from 1999 to 2016 a head-start program (HST) was implemented, to increase the recruitment and survival of juvenile iguanas. In 2021, we conducted a 10-week mark-recapture study to survey the population. Data obtained suggest that the Mona iguana lifespans can exceed 32 years, iguanas are very philopatric staying in the same areas over many years, and that health parameters for HST individuals are similar to those of wild ones. These findings provide new information that should be considered when implementing management actions directed at guaranteeing the survival of the Mona iguana.

AB  - Scope Currently knowledge is weak about which plant species boundaries are determined directly by climate and soil factors, versus which are mediated by biotic interactions, such as exclusion by superior competitors or by pathogens. Under moving climate zones the difference is important. For example, will warm boundaries shrink poleward of their own accord, or only following invasion by other species? What research will most effectively strengthen our understanding of this fundamental issue in ecology? Conclusions Traditionally the required experiment has been transplant beyond the species boundary, together with density manipulation of putative competitors, herbivores, pathogens or facilitators. But now climate zones are being moved across species distributions, creating a different sort of experiment. In order to learn efficiently from this massive inadvertent experiment, exposure to new climate needs to be combined with experimental manipulation of other factors. Because range extensions are likely to be spatially patchy, these experiments need to be geographically extensive, to be sustained over 2-4 decades, and to be twinned with wide-area population monitoring via drones and other remote sensing. Highest priorities for experimental manipulation would be removal of competition, and provision of seedlings. Highest priorities for locations would be zones where vegetation physiognomy changes, such as woodlands into grasslands, or rainforest into fire-prone forest.

AB  - Introduced Phragmites (Phragmites australis ssp. australis) forms part of an invasion assemblage in North America that includes non-native insect herbivores and parasitoids, some of which are now found on both the introduced and native subspecies of Phragmites (P. australis ssp. americanus). This insect assemblage is key to understanding the impact of P. australis invasion and interpreting the efficacy of biological control used against introduced P. australis. Our study provides the first dedicated comparison of insect assemblages associated with native and introduced P. australis in Canada. From a 2016 to 2017 survey of 28 geographically paired sites across Ontario, Canada, fourteen insect taxa were recorded from both subspecies. Genotype had no effect on alpha-diversity but stem attack rates from at least one herbivore were higher on native populations than on paired introduced populations (+ 18.6%). We report the first record of Chaetococcus phragmitis (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae) and Rhizedra lutosa (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Canada and of R. lutosa and Lasioptera hungarica (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) on native P. australis in North America.

AB  - Although roads are central to human society, they have many negative environmental impacts and create risk for traveling motorists. Our aim was to evaluate the spatiotemporal evolution of ungulate-vehicle collision (UVC) hotspots in response to major road construction. We examined two different locations and scales in the province of Alberta, Canada: (1) a highway bypass adjacent to a large city with 4.5 km of wildlife mitigation measures (wildlife fencing and two underpasses) and (2) 55 km of rural highway that was converted from a two-lane to a four-lane divided highway. Using government police collision and carcass data (2000-2021), beforeafter and control-impact analyses were used to assess changes in UVC rates. Our approach is novel in that we tested the paired use of a clustering method known as kernel density estimation plus and a spatiotemporal stepwise modification of this method to monitor UVC hotspots. By monitoring UVCs over space and time, we could identify stable vs. ephemeral UVC hotspots, a fence-end effect, and a barrier effect due to traffic volume, and we could explore hotspot stability before and after construction. The wildlife mitigation measures along the highway bypass resulted in 86% fewer UVCs compared to an unmitigated highway. At a larger scale, however, net benefits were affected by road density. The construction of a four-lane divided highway with no wildlife mitigation measures and an increase in the posted speed limit resulted in a slight increase in UVCs and the reemergence of the majority of historical UVC hotspots. Our analysis highlighted the need to incorporate wildlife considerations at a variety of scales throughout the transportation planning and mitigation evaluation process.

AB  - Hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae; HWA), an invasive aphid-like insect, was first documented on the East Coast of the United States in the 1950 s. Hemlock woolly adelgid is an herbivore which primarily feeds at the needle base of hemlock tree species (Pinaceae: Tsuga). With no evolutionary defenses and few biotic controls, the eastern and Carolina hemlock (Tsuga canadensis and Tsuga carolinensis) serve as the primary diet of HWA in eastern North America. The invasive pest began to spread rapidly throughout the hemlock's range causing defoliation and death of the trees within 4 -10 years. With the loss of the foundational species, Tsuga canadensis, several microenvironmental changes were documented. Microenvironmental changes in response to biological invasions and anthropogenic forestry practices can lead to shifts in populations of physiologically sensitive taxa such as salamanders and their prey, terrestrial arthropods.
   National Park Service (NPS) staff at Great Smoky Mountains National Park manage HWA by treating eastern hemlocks with the neonicotinoid pesticides, imidacloprid and dinotefuran. To measure indirect effects of eastern hemlock mortality, and HWA management, this study collected data on several parameters in hemlock-dominated stands that have been repeatedly managed by the NPS and stands which were un-managed and where HWA has reduced the hemlock canopy. Our major objectives were to assess microenvironmental, vegetative, and arthropod community differences between managed and un-managed eastern hemlock stands and analyze those differences with respect to woodland salamander abundance. Answering these questions should provide insight into indirect impacts of the invasive species, HWA, on indicator species, terrestrial salamanders, through changes in prey availability and microenvironmental parameters. A mixed effects linear model using elevation range as a random effect or block was used to model salamander abundance with prey availability, microenvironmental parameters, and HWA management as a factor. Our results indicate that HWA management was the strongest predictor of total salamander abundance and for Plethodon jordani and Desmognathus wrighti abundance individually. We found over five times the relative salamander abundance in sites which had been managed for HWA compared to sites which had been left un-managed.

AB  - Simple Summary Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an acute viral disease of sheep, goats, camels and some wild ruminant species. It is widespread in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, where it causes heavy economic losses. The disease is currently targeted by the Global Eradication Program (PPR GEP), aimed at eradicating the disease by 2030. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) national animal health plan adopts mass vaccination to control and eradicate PPR from the country. In this study, using the historical and real-time animals' identification and registration data together with different PPR occurrence risk factors, a mathematical algorithm was developed to intellectually design and implement a PPR vaccination campaign in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The algorithm was capable of prioritizing animal holdings at risk of PPR infection to be targeted by vaccination, facilitated the mobilization of vaccination teams in the field and resulted in an increased vaccination coverage of the targeted livestock population in a short time. Such achievements will enhance the UAE national PPR eradication plan to be fulfilled.Abstract Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a contagious and economically important transboundary viral disease of small ruminants. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) national animal health plan aimed to control and eradicate PPR from the country by following the global PPR control and eradication strategy which adopts small ruminants' mass vaccination to eradicate the disease from the globe by 2030. A smart vaccination approach, which is less expensive and has longer-term sustainable benefits, is needed to accelerate the eradication of PPR. In this study, a mathematical algorithm was developed based on animals' identification and registration data, belonging to the Abu Dhabi Agriculture and Food Safety Authority (ADAFSA), and other different parameters related to PPR risk occurrence. The latter included animal holding vaccination history, the number of animals per holding, forecasting of the number of animals and newborns per holding, the proximity of an animal holding to a PPR outbreak and the historical animal holding owner vaccination rejection attitude. The developed algorithm successfully prioritized animal holdings at risk of PPR infection within Abu Dhabi Emirate to be targeted by vaccination. This in turn facilitated the mobilization of field vaccination teams to target specific sheep and goat holdings to ensure the generation of immunity against the disease on a risk-based approach. The vaccination coverage of the targeted livestock population was increased to 86% and the vaccination rejection attitude was reduced by 35%. The duration of the vaccination campaign was reduced to 30 compared to 70 working days and hence can alleviate the depletion of human and logistic resources commonly used in classical mass vaccination campaigns. The results obtained from implementing the algorithm-based PPR vaccination campaign will reduce the negative impact of PPR on the UAE livestock sector and accelerate the achievement of the national PPR eradication plan requirements.

AB  - The Shortnose Guitarfish, Zapteryx brevirostris, is endemic to the Southwest Atlantic and its geographic range is commonly reported from Southeastern Brazil to Northern Argentina. However, range limits are imprecise or inconsistent in some cases. These inconsistencies were addressed in this study based on 1,363 specimens collected since 1865. These records were obtained from scientific collections, a systematic review of literature, and an on-board observation database. According to the data collected in this study, the known northernmost distributional limit of the species lies at the mouth of the Doce River, Northern Espirito Santo State, in Southeastern Brazil (19 degrees S). As for the other extreme of its range, the known southernmost distribution limit refers to the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) (53 degrees S). This represents more than 2,000 km of coastline geographic range extension - in comparison to the previous known southernmost range limit for this species. The geographical range of Z. brevirostris seems to follow biogeographic patterns operating at an ecosystem level in which biotic (especially in the north) and abiotic factors (especially in the south) play a role in imposing limits to its distribution range.

AB  - Natural populations evolve in response to biotic and abiotic changes in their environment, which shape species interactions and ecosystem dynamics. Agricultural systems can introduce novel conditions via herbicide exposure to non-crop habitats in surrounding fields. While herbicide drift is known to produce a variety of toxic effects in plants, little is known about its impact on nontarget wildlife species interactions. In a two-year study, we investigated the impact of herbicide drift on plant-herbivore interactions with common weed velvetleaf (Abutlion theophrasti) as the focal species. The findings reveal a significant increase in the phloem-feeding silverleaf whitefly (Bermisia tabaci) abundance on plants exposed to herbicide at drift rates of 0.5% and 1% of the field dose. We also identified a significant phenotypic trade-off between whitefly resistance and herbicide resistance in addition to whitefly resistance and relative growth rate in the presence of dicamba drift after increasing the populations grown in Year 2. In a follow-up greenhouse study, we found evidence that dicamba drift at 0.5% of the field dose significantly increased the average chlorophyll content (in milligrams per square centimeter) along with a positive correlation between whitefly abundance and chlorophyll content. Overall, these findings suggest herbicide exposure to nontarget communities can significantly alter herbivore populations, potentially impacting biodiversity and community dynamics of weed populations found at the agro-ecological interface.

AB  - Most phytophagous insects are specialists, so availability of suitable host plants often may be a critical factor limiting establishment of non-native insect species. Here we investigate the extent to which established nonnative tree-feeding insects utilize hosts that are native to the invaded range as well as hosts that are themselves non-native. We accomplish this by comparing host use among all native and non-native bark beetles and pinhole borers (Scolytinae and Platypodinae) established in Europe and North America reported in the literature. These groups of insects are well-known for the disparity among species in specialized behavior and development tied to host physiology. We find considerable variation in host breadth, as measured by species-level and genuslevel host richness and phylogenetic diversity of hosts, among different feeding guilds (ambrosia beetles, true bark beetles, twig beetles, and others). In each region, ambrosia and twig beetles exhibit the greatest diversity of hosts. Host breadth on native plants was generally greater for native beetle species than for non-native beetle species. In contrast, host breadth of non-native beetles is generally greater on non-native plants than on plants native to the focal region. These results indicate that successful invasion of these insect herbivores is dependent on the prior introduction of their non-native host plants, or the availability of native hosts that are closely related to their ancestral host plants.

AB  - Reintroduction and rewilding initiatives are key strategies to reverse human impacts on ecosystems and re-establish natural processes. However, rewilding may involve complex management scenarios, because many expanding species can have economic impacts and cause human-wildlife conflicts. Conflicts can be particularly challenging when carnivores, large herbivores and ecosystem engineers are involved. The Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) is a key ecosystem engineer that was once present in a large part of the Palearctic, but in Medieval times underwent a severe decline due to the joint effects of habitat loss and hunting. Subsequent legal protection and reintroductions triggered the recovery of the species through most of its original range. Eurasian beavers recently started the recolonization of Italy, because of the joint effects of natural dispersal (from Austria to northern Italy) and illegal reintroductions (central Italy). The lack of data on the most likely colonization routes hampers appropriate management of this species. Here, we identified the areas where beaver populations are most likely to arrive in the near future within Europe, with a specific focus on Italy. First, we developed spatially cross-validated species distribution models to identify the areas with the highest suitability for the Eurasian beaver in Europe. Second, we used connectivity modelling to assess the possible expansion routes of this species in Italy. Large areas of Europe are suitable for the beaver and may soon be colonized. The connectivity model showed a high potential for expansion from central Italy to surrounding areas, while the high isolation of northern Italy populations suggests a slower expansion. Our results can help environmental managers to understand where to focus both the future monitoring of beaver populations and actions aimed at preventing and mitigating possible human-wildlife conflicts that could arise from the expansion of an environmental engineer such as the beaver.

AB  - Wildlife animals are recognized as reservoirs for zoonotic fungi and their faeces might play an important role in introducing pathogens into the environment. Thought wild boar (Sus scrofa) population has dramatically increased across Europe, information about their possible role in dissemination of zoonotic pathogenic yeasts in the environment is scant. Therefore, fecal samples (n = 124) from wild boars from Campania region (Southern Italy) were collected and yeasts identified biochemically and molecularly by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region and their phylogenetical relationship assessed. The antifungal susceptibility profiles of yeasts were also investigated using AFST-EUCAST method. Yeasts were isolated from 50.1% of the samples with the highest occurrence in samples from the province of Salerno (61.1%). A total of 368 Candida strains belonging to nine species were identified, with Candida albicans (45.7%), followed by Candida krusei (15.2%), Kazachstania slooffiae (9.8%) and Candida parapsilosis (7.6%) as the most prevalent identified species. Among C. albicans four sequence types (i.e., ST1-ST4) were identified with an intraspecific nucleotide difference up to 0.21%. The ML tree grouped all representative sequence types as paraphyletic clades with those of the references yeast species, respectively and supported by high bootstrap values. Fluconazole was the less active drug whereas, posaconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole the most active one. No resistance phenomena were observed for C. albicans and high MICs values for 5FC, azoles and echinocandines were registered in non-albicans Candida spp. This study showed, for the first time, the important role of wild boars in dissemination of pathogenic fungi in the environment. The absence of resistance phenomena in the Candida spp. might reflect environmental free from residues of azoles antifungals pollution or chemicals and suggests the role of wild boar as bio indicators of environment quality.

AB  - 1. The impacts of natural disasters on marine mammals are poorly understood and difficult to study, which can hamper management responses following such events.
   2. This study provides the first distribution and abundance assessment of New Zealand fur seal (NZFS: Arctocephalus forsteri) colonies around Kaikoura, New Zealand, since a 7.8 magnitude earthquake in November 2016 caused substantial changes to both the local marine and terrestrial environments, and led to the reconstruction of a major highway that runs adjacent to NZFS colonies.
   3. Mark-recapture and direct counts in the 2022-2023 breeding season estimated pup production for NZFS breeding colonies along the Kaikoura coast. Using established multipliers, pup estimates were used to provide the first comprehensive population estimate for Kaikoura's NZFS population since the earthquake.
   4. Three new colonies and three new subcolonies were assessed and recorded, additional to reassessments of two established colonies. Overall, Kaikoura's NZFS population has grown and spread post-earthquake, with an upper total population estimate of between 21,560 and 28,327 animals in the 2022-2023 breeding season. Some sites, such as Lynch's Reef, appear to have benefited from earthquake-induced coastal uplift, with pup production increasing. Contrastingly, the estimated 2,401 (+/- 99) pups produced at (O) over bar hau Point in 2023 is similar to preearthquake estimates. This indicates that the earthquake has disrupted previously documented growth at this site. The distribution of NZFS breeding at (O) over bar hau Point has also changed substantially since the last pre-earthquake assessment.
   5. From these findings, alterations to the (O) over bar hau Point New Zealand Fur Seal Sanctuary and similar protections at other locations on the Kaik (o) over bar ura coast are suggested, as greater numbers of NZFSs are now accessible to human interaction and disturbance. The results demonstrate both how natural disasters and subsequent infrastructure modifications can impact coastal species and how conservation measures may need to be amended accordingly.

AB  - Herbivore outbreaks cause serious damage to forest trees. In recent decades, outbreaks of the gall midge Schizomyia castanopsisae (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) inducing inflorescence galls on Castanopsis sieboldii (Fagaceae) occurred in the Izu Islands, Tokyo, Japan. We investigated the gall density on the islands and estimated the larval population on Miyakejima Island. We also surveyed seasonal changes in larval age structure, presence of natural enemies, larval cold tolerance, and thermal effects on the adult emergence. In addition, we conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses of S. castanopsisae populations among different localities. The gall density was particularly high in southern parts (from Miyakejima to Aogashima) of the Izu Islands. The gall midge seemed to have been expanding its range toward northern parts in recent years. On Miyakejima, the larval population was estimated to be approximately 158 and 36 bn in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Parasitoids were not found in the dissection of galls. A cold temperature treatment did not affect the percentage of adult emergence. Developmental zero and thermal constant during the period from larval departure to adult emergence were estimated to be 4.7 degrees C and 588.2 degrees C-days in males and 7.4 degrees C and 476.2 degrees C-days in females, and the adults were predicted to emerge in April. Populations in Kyushu were genetically distinct from those in Okinawajima and the Izu Islands, but a common haplotype was found between the latter two localities. These imply that S. castanopsisae on the Izu Islands may be a recent invasion, and the absence of natural enemies causes its outbreaks.

AB  - Over the last century, water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms, has invaded freshwater systems in more than 50 countries, causing changes in biodiversity and widespread ecological damage. It also disrupts fisheries, navigation routes, power generation, and water supply. Although water hyacinth has invaded all tropical and subtropical countries and some parts of the Mediterranean basin, recent climate change models suggest that its distribution may soon expand into higher latitudes as temperatures rise within Europe, unless effective preventative management measures are put in place. In this paper, we explore the potential ecological and socioeconomic impacts of water hyacinth invasion using well-documented case studies from Lake Victoria. We also consider the relative effectiveness of biological, chemical, and mechanical control measures on established populations. We conclude that water hyacinth is almost impossible to remove once established, and that controlling its spread into new areas is probably the most cost-effective way of reducing its impact. We propose a framework for the preventative management of this weed by combining the use of environmental DNA as an early warning system with heightened biosecurity to prevent accidental introductions and the physical removal of invasive plants before they become established. We also recommend that nutrient concentrations be lowered in waterbodies to reduce their susceptibility to water hyacinth invasion and reduce its growth rate if introduced accidentally.

AB  - Home ranges are vitally important to an animal's behavior, survival, and reproduction. Variation in environmental conditions and landscape composition coupled with differences between sexes can influence home range structure, and understanding these differences is important for species management. Elk (Cervus canadensis Erxleben, 1777) are a widespread culturally important ungulate that has been well studied over portions of its range. Reintroduced populations in eastern North America, where conditions differ dramatically from those in the west, are comparatively understudied. Using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck movement models, we calculated season- and sex-specific home range and core areas for elk in Pennsylvania, USA. Results showed strong seasonal variation in sizes of core areas and home ranges, with summer ranges consistently smaller than other seasons. Home ranges were largely forested. However, forest cover of core areas was lower than home ranges. Proportion of open cover types was greater in core areas than home ranges. Use of timber harvests overall was low. However, among individuals with highly forested home ranges, timber harvests were strongly selected for in spring. This work highlights the regional specificity in the size, composition, and seasonality of elk home ranges, and stresses the need for additional context-specific research in understudied elk populations of forested eastern landscapes.

AB  - Knowledge on how adaptive evolution and human socio-cultural and economic interests shaped livestock genomes particularly in sub-Saharan Africa remains limited. Ethiopia is in a geographic region that has been critical in the history of African agriculture with ancient and diverse human ethnicity and bio-climatic conditions. Using 52K genome-wide data analysed in 646 individuals from 13 Ethiopian indigenous goat populations, we observed high levels of genetic variation. Although runs of homozygosity (ROH) were ubiquitous genome-wide, there were clear differences in patterns of ROH length and abundance and in effective population sizes illustrating differences in genome homozygosity, evolutionary history, and management. Phylogenetic analysis incorporating patterns of genetic differentiation and gene flow with ancestry modelling highlighted past and recent intermixing and possible two deep ancient genetic ancestries that could have been brought by humans with the first introduction of goats in Africa. We observed four strong selection signatures that were specific to Arsi-Bale and Nubian goats. These signatures overlapped genomic regions with genes associated with morphological, adaptation, reproduction and production traits due possibly to selection under environmental constraints and/or human preferences. The regions also overlapped uncharacterized genes, calling for a comprehensive annotation of the goat genome. Our results provide insights into mechanisms leading to genome variation and differentiation in sub-Saharan Africa indigenous goats.

AB  - The density of insect herbivores is regulated by top-down factors (e.g., natural enemies), bottom-up effects (e.g., plant defenses against herbivory), or a combination of both. As such, understanding the relative importance of these factors can have important implications for the establishment of effective management options for invasive species. Here, we compared the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up factors on the abundance of hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae. HWA is invasive in eastern North America, but its native range includes the Pacific Northwest of North America where it has co-evolved with western hemlock, Tsuga heterophylla. Eastern hemlock, Tsuga canadensis, can also be found planted in city and park settings in the Pacific Northwest and the presence of both host species allowed us to directly compare the importance of predators (top-down) and host plant resistance (bottom-up) on HWA abundance by placing mesh exclusion bags on branches of both species and monitoring HWA abundance over two years. We found no evidence for bottom-up control of HWA on western hemlock (a native host). HWA established more readily on that species than on eastern hemlock on which it is a major pest in eastern North America. We found strong evidence for top-down control in that both summer and winter-active predators significantly reduced HWA densities on the branches of both tree species where predators were allowed access. These findings support the validity of the biological control program for HWA, the goal of which is to reduce outbreak populations of HWA in eastern North America.

AB  - The Lori-Bakhtiari fat-tailed sheep is one of the most important heavyweight native breeds of Iran. The breed is robust and well-adapted to semi-arid regions and an important resource for smallholder farms. An established nucleus-based breeding scheme is used to improve their production traits but there is an indication of inbreeding depression and loss of genetic diversity due to selection. Here, we estimated the inbreeding levels and the distribution of runs of homozygosity (ROH) islands in 122 multi-generational female Lori-Bakhtiari from different half-sib families selected from a breeding station that were genotyped on the 50k array. A total of 2404 ROH islands were identified. On average, there were 19.70 +/- 1.4 ROH per individual ranging between 6 and 41. The mean length of the ROH was 4.1 +/- 0.14 Mb. There were 1999 short ROH of length 1-6 Mb and another 300 in the 6-12 Mb range. Additionally long ROH indicative of inbreeding were found in the ranges of 12-24 Mb (95) and 24-48 Mb (10). The average inbreeding coefficient (F-ROH) was 0.031 +/- 0.003 with estimates varying from 0.006 to 0.083. Across generations, F-ROH increased from 0.019 +/- 0.012 to 0.036 +/- 0.007. Signatures of selection were identified on chromosomes 2, 6, and 10, encompassing 55 genes and 23 QTL associated with production traits. Inbreeding coefficients are currently within acceptable levels but across generations, inbreeding is increasing due to selection. The breeding program needs to actively monitor future inbreeding rates and ensure that the breed maintains or improves on its current levels of environmental adaptation.

AB  - Trapania is a genus of dorid nudibranchs and one of the lesser studied members in the family Goniodorididae. Previous studies have been limited to using morphological data for producing phylogenies and establishing species relationships. This study presents the first molecular phylogeny for the genus Trapania with the goal of resolving questions that surfaced in previous morphological studies and enhancing our understanding of Trapania clade structure and species relationships. Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood and two types of species delimitation analyses reveal 15 previously described species and nine new species, which are described: Trapania kahel sp. nov., Trapania kamagong sp. nov., Trapania kanaloa sp. nov., Trapania lemanioides sp. nov., Trapania stegodon sp. nov., Trapania tamaraw sp. nov., Trapania tatsulok sp. nov., Trapania tigger sp. nov. and Trapania undulata sp. nov. Preliminary evidence presented here suggests that Atlantic and eastern Pacific species form a distinct clade and diverged from ancestors that were more widespread. An Indo-Pacific clade is sister to this clade, but stronger support and broader taxon sampling are required to test this hypothesis.

AB  - Introduction: Insect herbivores and biotrophic pathogens are major stressors influencing natural regeneration in woodlands. Information on the effect of elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) on plant-insect-pathogen interactions under natural conditions is lacking.Methods: We studied the effects of eCO(2) on leaf-out phenology, as well as on levels of insect herbivory and powdery mildew (PM), i.e., reduction of leaf photosynthetic material. We then assessed the combined impacts of these biotic stressors and eCO(2) on seedling photosynthesis and growth. A total of 92 naturally recruited and 114 potted seedlings of 5 temperate tree species (Quercus robur, Acer pseudoplatanus, Corylus avellana, Crataegus monogyna, and Ilex aquifolium) within a mature oak woodland were studied.Results: We found that eCO(2) advanced leaf-out phenology and was a significant explanatory variable for growth and physiological performance in potted seedlings. Potted oak seedlings experienced 11-fold higher tissue loss from insect herbivory than natural seedlings. The earliest leaf-flushing species, hawthorn, and the evergreen holly were resistant to insect attack and were not affected by PM. Oak was defoliated most but showed the highest regeneration capacity. Hazel was more resistant to PM infection than oak and sycamore. Despite being highly infected by PM, sycamore was less affected than oak. The more vigorous sycamore and oak seedlings suffered more severe PM disease.Conclusion: No evidence emerged that eCO(2) enhances natural regeneration under biotic stress for any of the species studied.

AB  - This article analyzes how the "risky" mobilities of animals and viruses provoke government reactions that result in bordering processes: From 2020 onwards, German authorities erected hundreds of kilometers of fence along the Eastern border with Poland in response to the spreading of African swine fever (ASF), a highly contagious viral disease that affects both wild boars and domesticated pigs. The government's main intention behind fencing was to secure the German borderline against the unwanted border crossings of potentially infected wild boars from Poland. At this point in time, the animals were framed as a disease reservoir, while their wayward spatial movements were depicted as a biosecurity threat to the export-dependent German pig sector. Drawing on qualitative fieldwork in the state of Saxony, the article illustrates how government actors employed three techniques seeking to depoliticize the erection of veterinary fences, presenting them as an apolitical matter of concern, while withdrawing them from public scrutiny and contestation: first, re-scaling authority to the sub-national level; second, securitization; and third, disinformation. Yet, adopting a more-than-human approach to the study of borders, the article also points out how a number of human and nonhuman entities forged wayward relations that worked towards a repoliticization of the fences, while counteracting government intentions in the management and control of disease.

AB  - The fish families Scaridae and Acanthuridae are herbivorous that control algal growth on corals. Their exclusion due to illegal fishing and coastal development quickly leads to the dominance of macroalgae on the reef. To estimate the density and intensity of grazing of Scaridae and Acanthuridae and their relationship with macroalgae cover, two terraces were selected in the Guanahacabibes National Park (PNG) and one in Havana (LH), the latter with high andropic degradation. Video-quadrants of 1 m(2) were used to obtain the density of fish (individuals/m(2)) and grazing intensity (bites/5 minutes*m(2)) and quadrants of 25x25 cm for the relative abundance of macroalgae. Ten species were identified, Scaridae predominated in PNG and Acanthuridae in LH. The loss of Scaridae in LH implies that Acanthuridae represents an excess of a functional group that does not provide the bare substrate for coral recruitment. There was a strong positive correlation between the density and intensity of grazing of Scaridac with Halimeda, since in PNG this alga is favored and constitutes a recurrent and efficient food for Scaridae. In LH, eutrophication bioindicator algae such as Stypopodium predominated and only showed a positive correlation with Acanthuridae. These fish consume the epiphytes on Stypopodium, and their grazing rates are higher, which contributes to the cultivation of turf algae, strong competitors for space with corals. Hence the importance of presenting more equitable communities with different functional groups of herbivorous fish that contribute to a more effective control of macroalgac.

AB  - Carnivores tend to exhibit a lack of (or less pronounced) genetic structure at continental scales in both a geographic and temporal sense and this can confound the identification of post-glacial colonization patterns in this group. In this study we used genome-wide data (using genotyping by sequencing [GBS]) to reconstruct the phylogeographic history of a widespread carnivore, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), by investigating broad-scale patterns of genomic variation, differentiation and admixture amongst contemporary populations in Europe. Using 15,003 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 524 individuals allowed us to identify the importance of refugial regions for the red fox in terms of endemism (e.g., Iberia). In addition, we tested multiple post-glacial recolonization scenarios of previously glaciated regions during the Last Glacial Maximum using an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach that were unresolved from previous studies. This allowed us to identify the role of admixture from multiple source population post-Younger Dryas in the case of Scandinavia and ancient land-bridges in the colonization of the British Isles. A natural colonization of Ireland was deemed more likely than an ancient human-mediated introduction as has previously been proposed and potentially points to a larger mammalian community on the island in the early post-glacial period. Using genome-wide data has allowed us to tease apart broad-scale patterns of structure and diversity in a widespread carnivore in Europe that was not evident from using more limited marker sets and provides a foundation for next-generation phylogeographic studies in other non-model species.

AB  - Simple Summary Charismatic Sumatran mammals (i.e., the elephant, orangutan, and tiger) play a pivotal role in maintaining ecosystem balance. Nevertheless, these species have encountered multifaceted threats due to habitat disturbances, leading to their potential extinction. Thus, understanding current species ranges, together with investigating the most essential factors for the species, are crucial for developing conservation strategies. We predicted the potential range of three charismatic mammals in Sumatra Island using anthropogenic, biophysical, topographic, and climatic parameters based on ensemble machine learning algorithms. This study also comprehensively describes how land ownerships can shape the existence of these three species. Finally, we provide recommendations based on our findings for species conservation planning and management options. Tropical Rainforest Heritage sites of Sumatra are some of the most irreplaceable landscapes in the world for biodiversity conservation. These landscapes harbor many endangered Asiatic mammals all suffering multifaceted threats due to anthropogenic activities. Three charismatic mammals in Sumatra: Elephas maximus sumatranus, Pongo abelii, and Panthera tigris sumatrae are protected and listed as Critically Endangered (CR) within the IUCN Red List. Nevertheless, their current geographic distribution remains unclear, and the impact of environmental factors on these species are mostly unknown. This study predicts the potential range of those species on the island of Sumatra using anthropogenic, biophysical, topographic, and climatic parameters based on the ensemble machine learning algorithms. We also investigated the effects of habitat loss from current land use, ecosystem availability, and importance of Indonesian protected areas. Our predictive model had relatively excellent performance (Sorensen: 0.81-0.94) and can enhance knowledge on the current species distributions. The most critical environmental predictors for the distribution of the three species are conservation status and temperature seasonality. This study revealed that more than half of the species distributions occurred in non-protected areas, with proportional coverage being 83%, 72%, and 54% for E.m. sumatranus, P. abelii, and P.t. sumatrae, respectively. Our study further provides reliable information on places where conservation efforts must be prioritized, both inside and outside of the protected area networks, to safeguard the ongoing survival of these Indonesian large charismatic mammals.

AB  - Warming climate and increasing desertification urge the identification of genes involved in heat and dehydration tolerance to better inform and target biodiversity conservation efforts. Comparisons among extant desert-adapted species can highlight parallel or convergent patterns of genome evolution through the identification of shared signatures of selection. We generate a chromosome-level genome assembly for the canyon mouse (Peromyscus crinitus) and test for a signature of parallel evolution by comparing signatures of selective sweeps across population-level genomic resequencing data from another congeneric desert specialist (Peromyscus eremicus) and a widely distributed habitat generalist (Peromyscus maniculatus), that may be locally adapted to arid conditions. We identify few shared candidate loci involved in desert adaptation and do not find support for a shared pattern of parallel evolution. Instead, we hypothesize divergent molecular mechanisms of desert adaptation among deer mice, potentially tied to species-specific historical demography, which may limit or enhance adaptation. We identify a number of candidate loci experiencing selective sweeps in the P. crinitus genome that are implicated in osmoregulation (Trypsin, Prostasin) and metabolic tuning (Kallikrein, eIF2-alpha kinase GCN2, APPL1/2), which may be important for accommodating hot and dry environmental conditions.

AB  - Invasive species are widely implicated in the decline of songbird populations, potentially via indirect effects such as the restructuring of ecological communities by non-native plants. We used stable isotope analysis to investigate whether ground foraging, generalist insectivore ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla (Linnaeus, 1766)) shifted diets following invasion by a non-native shrub, Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii DC.), in a temperate woodland system in New York, USA where barberry was previously linked to trophic downgrading in the leaf litter arthropod community. Assimilated ovenbird diets were primarily composed of predatory invertebrates followed by sucking herbivores, chewing herbivores, and detritivores. The only notable changes in assimilated ovenbird diets were a modest 14.7% decrease in chewing herbivore contributions and a minor 7.0% increase in sucking herbivore contributions in forest patches with high barberry densities. Our results indicate that the effects of non-native plants on connections between higher trophic levels are context-dependent, and comparisons with other studies suggest that community complexity and time since introduction are key contextual differences that affect the outcome of an invasion. Our results may reflect compensatory shifts in individual foraging effort by ovenbirds, but, in combination with our previous research, provide little evidence that barberry affects ovenbird condition and therefore downstream outcomes.

AB  - The wild boar (Sus scrofa) originates from warm islands but now inhabits large areas of the world, with Antarctica as the only continent not inhabited by this species. One might be tempted to think that its wide distribution results from increasing environmental temperatures. However, any effect of temperature is only indirect: Abundant availability of critical food resources can fully compensate the negative effects of cold winters on population growth. Here, we asked if temperature as a habitat factor is unimportant compared with other habitat indices, simply because wild boars are excellent thermoregulators. We found that the thermoneutral zone in summer was approximately 6-24 & DEG;C. In winter, the thermoneutral zone was lowered to 0-7 & DEG;C. The estimated increase in the heart rate and energy expenditure in the cold was less than 30% per 10 & DEG;C temperature decline. This relatively small increase of energy expenditure during cold exposure places the wild boar in the realm of arctic animals, such as the polar bear, whereas tropical mammals raise their energy expenditure several fold. The response of wild boars to high Ta was weak across all seasons. In the heat, wild boars avoid close contact to conspecifics and particularly use wallowing in mud or other wet substrates to cool and prevent hyperthermia. Wild boars also rely on daily cycles, especially of rhythms in subcutaneous temperature that enables them to cheaply build large core-shell gradients, which serve to lower heat loss. We argue it is predominantly this ability which allowed wild boars to inhabit most climatically diverse areas in the world.

AB  - Objectives: The Holocene arrival of humans on Madagascar precipitated major changes to the island's biodiversity. The now-extinct, endemic "subfossil" megafauna of Madagascar were likely hunted by early human inhabitants. Perhaps in part due to preferential hunting of larger prey, no surviving endemic species on Madagascar is >10 kg. Moreover, some subfossil bones of extant lemurs are considerably larger than those of the modern members of their species, but subfossil versus modern locale differences for the comparisons conducted to date lead to uncertainty about whether these size differences reflect in situ change or pre-existing ecogeographic variation. Here, we revisited this question with samples from nearby locales.
   Materials and Methods: We used high-resolution 3D scan data to conduct comparative morphological analyses of subfossil and modern skeletal remains of one of the larger extant lemurs, Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi) from subfossil and modern sites only similar to 10 km apart: Taolambiby (bones dated to 725-560-1075-955 cal. years before present) and Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, respectively.
   Results: The mean aggregate score for all subfossil elements (n = 12; 0.089 +/- 0.117) is significantly greater than that for the modern individuals (n = 31; 0.009 +/- 0.045; t-test; p = 0.039). We found that the average subfossil sifaka bone is similar to 9% larger than that of modern sifakas (permutation test p = 0.037).
   Discussion: We cannot yet conclude whether this size difference reflects evolutionary change or an archaeological aggregation/taphonomic process. However, if this is a case of phyletic dwarfism in response to human size-selective harvesting pressures then the estimated rate of change is greater than those previously calculated for other archaeological cases of this phenomenon.

AB  - Wildlife crossing structures and road calming measures are frequently implemented to improve habitat connectivity and mitigate the risks of wildlife-vehicle collisions on roads. Although Southeast Asia is a known biodiversity hotspot, majority of studies assessing effectiveness of such structures were conducted outside the region. Existing studies also tended to be non-comparative and focused on crossing structures in silo. We addressed this gap by simultaneously surveying and comparing the usage frequency of mammals across three crossing types-culverts, roads and rope bridges-along a road surrounded by forests in Singapore. This allowed us to evaluate the preferences of mammals, assess usage patterns and investigate factors influencing the use of different crossing types. Using camera traps and closed-circuit televisions, we documented 1133 independent crossing events across a 9-month study period from March to November 2021. Fourteen mammal species were detected across all crossing types, with wild boar (Sus scrofa) being the most prevalent species (68.2%). Locally critically endangered species such as the Malayan porcupine (Hystrix brachyura), Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica), and Raffles' banded langur (Presbytis femoralis femoralis) were also recorded to use culverts, roads, and rope bridges for crossings, respectively. Although many species used multiple crossing types, most species had a preferred crossing method. Between culverts and roads, factors that influenced crossing preferences included group size for wild boars and time of day and presence of fences for other mammals. Even though such culverts were intended for drainage, they were still widely used by mammals. Overall, all three crossing methods were crucial in facilitating the movement of animals between habitats. Thus, a variety of infrastructure and measures to accommodate the diversity of wildlife moving across forest patches in a fragmented landscape is recommended.

AB  - Fencing is a ubiquitous feature of our agricultural landscape. Fences necessarily have the potential to reduce habitat connectivity for resident ungulate populations. Unsuccessful fence crossings have the potential to cause injury or death to wildlife, as well as resulting in damage to the fence in terms of time and maintenance costs. Wildlife friendly fence designs may provide landowners and ungulate managers the opportunity to mitigate risks associated with wildlife crossings. Using remote cameras (n = 12) along the perimeter fence of the Wainwright Dunes Ecological Reserve, Alberta, we quantified and compared elk crossing behaviors at standard 4 strand fences and gates as well as 3 strand fences and gates both with experimentally modified top and bottom strand heights. We found that wildlife friendly designs promoted behavioral options for elk of various demographic classes to cross fences. Our results suggest that the number of strands and the height of the top and bottom strand are important determinants for animals deciding to cross over, through, or under fences. While difficult or problematic crossings were primarily determined by how the individual crossed and made up a proportionally small number of crossings, the sheer volume of crossings we observed suggests that any modification which increases fence permeability to elk will likely result in less damage to fences and the crossing individuals.

AB  - The glacial cycles of the Quaternary heavily impacted species through successions of population contractions and expansions. Similarly, populations have been intensely shaped by human pressures such as unregulated hunting and land use changes. White-tailed and mule deer survived in different refugia through the Last Glacial Maximum, and their populations were severely reduced after the European colonization. Here, we analyzed 73 resequenced deer genomes from across their North American range to understand the consequences of climatic and anthropogenic pressures on deer demographic and adaptive history. We found strong signals of climate-induced vicariance and demographic decline; notably, multiple sequentially Markovian coalescent recovers a severe decline in mainland white-tailed deer effective population size (Ne) at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum. We found robust evidence for colonial overharvest in the form of a recent and dramatic drop in Ne in all analyzed populations. Historical census size and restocking data show a clear parallel to historical Ne estimates, and temporal Ne/Nc ratio shows patterns of conservation concern for mule deer. Signatures of selection highlight genes related to temperature, including a cold receptor previously highlighted in woolly mammoth. We also detected immune genes that we surmise reflect the changing land use patterns in North America. Our study provides a detailed picture of anthropogenic and climatic-induced decline in deer diversity and clues to understanding the conservation concerns of mule deer and the successful demographic recovery of white-tailed deer.

AB  - Brown Skua (Stercorarius antarcticus-lonnbergi) and South Polar Skua (Stercorarius maccormicki) occur throughout the Antarctic Peninsula and are sympatric in distribution over 500 km. In this region, hybridization between a male South Polar Skua and a female Brown Skua producing viable and fertile offspring. The present study aims to review the evolutionary history of South Polar Skua and Brown Skua to understand the hybridization process between these species better. To assess the evolutionary history between these species, 67 DNA samples were sequenced for AK1 locus, 70 samples for RAG1 locus, and 96 samples for Cytb locus, from individuals sampled at King George Island and Elephant Island. Cytb and RAG1 loci showed greater genetic diversity in samples from hybrid birds than those of non-hybrid individuals and may reflect the outcome of the heterosis. Overall, Brown Skua had higher genetic diversity than South Polar Skua. In addition, South Polar Skua showed probable populational expansion signals, in contrast to Brown Skua which showed population stability through time. However, our phylogenetic analysis did not corroborate the reciprocal monophyly between these species. Thus, South Polar Skua and Brown Skua show incomplete lineage sorting, indicating these species are a single taxonomic group.

AB  - Quantifying spatiotemporally explicit interactions within animal populations facilitates the understanding of social structure and its relationship with ecological processes. Data from animal tracking technologies (Global Positioning Systems ["GPS"]) can circumvent longstanding challenges in the estimation of spatiotemporally explicit interactions, but the discrete nature and coarse temporal resolution of data mean that ephemeral interactions that occur between consecutive GPS locations go undetected. Here, we developed a method to quantify individual and spatial patterns of interaction using continuous-time movement models (CTMMs) fit to GPS tracking data. We first applied CTMMs to infer the full movement trajectories at an arbitrarily fine temporal scale before estimating interactions, thus allowing inference of interactions occurring between observed GPS locations. Our framework then infers indirect interactions-individuals occurring at the same location, but at different times-while allowing the identification of indirect interactions to vary with ecological context based on CTMM outputs. We assessed the performance of our new method using simulations and illustrated its implementation by deriving disease-relevant interaction networks for two behaviorally differentiated species, wild pigs (Sus scrofa) that can host African Swine Fever and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) that can host chronic wasting disease. Simulations showed that interactions derived from observed GPS data can be substantially underestimated when temporal resolution of movement data exceeds 30-min intervals. Empirical application suggested that underestimation occurred in both interaction rates and their spatial distributions. CTMM-Interaction method, which can introduce uncertainties, recovered majority of true interactions. Our method leverages advances in movement ecology to quantify fine-scale spatiotemporal interactions between individuals from lower temporal resolution GPS data. It can be leveraged to infer dynamic social networks, transmission potential in disease systems, consumer-resource interactions, information sharing, and beyond. The method also sets the stage for future predictive models linking observed spatiotemporal interaction patterns to environmental drivers.

AB  - Introduction: Plants and their insect herbivores represent a large fraction of the species in Amazonian forests and are often directly implicated in the origin and maintenance of biodiversity at local and regional scales. How these interactions may change over geographic distance is unknown because very few studies have investigated the herbivore fauna and defense chemicals of any host plant species at multiple sites in tropical forests. One hypothesis, the Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution, predicts that if herbivore assemblages turn over in different parts of a plant's range, then plant defense chemicals should also change, reflecting local selection pressures.
   Methods: We tested this theory by studying 12 species of Protium (Burseraceae) trees that occur in both Iquitos, Peru, and Manaus, Brazil, in rainforests separated by 1500 km. We surveyed all insects observed directly feeding on the plants in both locations for 48 weeks in Manaus and 64 weeks in Iquitos. We analyzed the secondary metabolites in the leaves of all species in both locations using GC/MS and HPLC.
   Results and Discussion: Although in both locations we found that Protium herbivores were dominated by insects from the orders Hemiptera, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, we found almost complete turnover in the herbivore species composition in the two sites, and each host plant species had a different assemblage of herbivores in each location. Comparing the phylogenetic beta-diversity, we found low similarity in herbivore phylogenetic relatedness between host plant species in the two locations. However, the secondary metabolites found within a Protiumspecieswere similar across the two locations. We found no strong evidence that individuals from a host plant species in Iquitos or Manaus expressed locally-adapted defense chemicals, as individuals from geographic locations did not form clusters when looking at patterns of chemical similarity. These results are not consistent with the Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution. The most intriguing pattern we found was a strong correlation between the diversity of herbivores per host plant species in both locations. We also found that plants with high chemical richness had lower numbers of herbivore species and numbers of total herbivores in both locations. We conclude that high chemical diversity is the most effective strategy for Protium trees to reduce insect herbivore attacks. We speculate that each secondary metabolite is effective at repelling only a few insect herbivores, and that different chemicals are likely effective in different parts of a plants' geographic range. Future studies should investigate additional locations and additional natural enemies (i.e., fungal pathogens) to test the hypothesis that chemical diversity reduces attack from natural enemies and may explain the ecological and evolutionary success of rainforest trees over time and space.

AB  - It is largely unknown how mammalian genomes evolve under rapid speciation and environmental adaptation. An excellent model for understanding fast evolution is provided by the genus Sus, which diverged relatively recently and lacks postzygotic isolation. Here, we present a high-quality reference genome of the Visayan warty pig, which is specialized to a tropical island environment. Comparing the genome sequences and chromatin contact maps of the Visayan warty pig (Sus cebifrons) and domestic pig (Sus scrofa), we characterized the dynamics of chromosomal structure evolution during Sus speciation, revealing the similar chromosome conformation as the potential biological mechanism of frequent postdivergence hybridization among Suidae. We further investigated the different signatures of adaptive selection and domestication in Visayan warty pig and domestic pig with specific emphasize on the evolution of olfactory and gustatory genes, elucidating higher olfactory diversity in Visayan warty pig and positive and relaxed evolution of bitter and fat taste receptors, respectively, in domestic pig. Our comprehensive evolutionary and comparative genome analyses provide insight into the dynamics of genomes and how these change over relative short evolutionary times, as well as how these genomic differences encode for differences in the phenotypes.

AB  - The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) is increasingly threatened by habitat loss, climatic extremes, and genetic isolation. Kangaroo Island hosts the only introduced population of the species outside its natural range, offering a rare opportunity to examine population resilience under environmental stress. We conducted live-trapping surveys in the Rocky River catchment in 2021 and 2022, following severe drought, bushfires, and flooding, and compared results with historical data from 1998 to 2000. Capture rates in 2021-2022 were approximately half those recorded two decades earlier, with declining catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) observed further upstream, suggesting altered spatial dynamics or reduced abundance. Juveniles were captured in both years, indicating continued reproduction despite recent disturbances. Dietary analysis showed a shift in prey composition, with a higher prevalence of Decapoda in 2022, and blood analyses identified year-to-year differences in red cell counts, haemoglobin, and glucose concentrations. These findings point to a population that remains reproductively active and behaviourally flexible, but potentially vulnerable to ongoing environmental change. Given the catchment's limited extent, low genetic diversity, and projections of increasing drought frequency and reduced rainfall, this population may face heightened extinction risks in the coming decades. Continued monitoring of abundance, health, and habitat use is essential for assessing long-term viability and informing conservation strategies, both for this population and as a model for managing isolated platypus populations under climate stress.

AB  - Context Wild-pig hunting is a culturally significant recreational and commercial activity in Texas, but the overall impacts are contested. Except for one 1980s study, there has been no research to formally quantify any economic benefits of wild-pig hunting in Texas, which is an important component for weighing the costs and benefits of wild-pig presence in the state.Aims and methods To fill that research gap, we surveyed a sample of resident and non-resident 2018-2019 hunting-license holders in Texas about various topics related to their wild-pig hunting activities, including expenditures.Key results On the basis of the 37,317 responses received, we estimated that the marginal annual direct economic benefit of wild-pig hunting to the Texas economy ranges between US$68.5 million and US$188.0 million (2022 dollar values). Given that we were not able to distinguish whether purchases were made in or out of state for expenses provided, we believe this range is an upper estimate.Conclusion and implications Although hunting is an important consideration in the discussion of wild-pig management, this estimate is dwarfed by the estimated total damage costs associated with wild pigs in Texas.

AB  - Introduction The Sanzenbacher Ranch deposit represents an early Permian plant assemblage in north-central Texas predominantly composed of pteridosperms, of which callipterids are dominant. This study investigates the interactions of a taxonomically broad range of plant hosts with insects, mites, and pathogens to assess the richness and frequency of damage.Methods We used standard methods of the functional feeding group--damage type system and analyses graphically illustrated as nonmetric multidimensional scaling.Results Of the total surface area represented, we quantified the fraction of the area herbivorized, providing a comparative perspective with regard to several similar studies of herbivory at nearby plant assemblages from the late Paleozoic. To assess insect herbivory, 1,361 plant specimens were analyzed, including fronds, leaves, reproductive structures, axes, and wood impressions. A total of 205 specimens presented one or more instances of insect herbivory (11.17%). Callipterid-peltasperms exhibited the highest number of interactions, with Autunia conferta, Rhachiphyllum schenkii, cf. Lodevia sp., cf. Comia sp., and an unidentified callipterid accounting for 49.34% of all interactions. Medullosans represented 10.53%, followed by lyginopterids with 8.55%. Forty-eight damage types (DTs) were recognized and classified into the nine functional feeding groups of hole feeding, margin feeding, surface feeding, piercing and sucking, oviposition, galling, seed predation, borings, and pathogens.Discussion When compared to analogous late Paleozoic plant assemblages in Texas, Sanzenbacher Ranch exhibited almost all herbivore functional feeding groups, high richness of DTs, and low herbivory index of 0.26. This record shows high plant diversity in a seasonally dry environment that supports a trend of an early Permian increase in DT diversity in southwestern Euramerica. Sanzenbacher Ranch, different from other early Permian plant assemblages, sheds light on the dynamic ecological interactions of these ancient ecosystems.

AB  - Hard ticks (Ixodidae family) are primary vectors of zoonotic diseases, including severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTSV), anaplasmosis, babesiosis, Lyme borreliosis, and ehrlichiosis. The roe deer (Capreolus pygargus tianschanicus), a key host for tick-borne diseases, is widely distributed on Jeju Island, Republic of Korea (ROK). Although the increased interactions between deer, livestock, and humans have raised concerns about zoonotic disease transmission, this area has remained understudied. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the species diversity of ticks infesting roe deer and the prevalence of major tick-borne diseases in this region. From 2018 to 2020, 1832 ticks were collected from 154 roe deer. Four tick species were identified: Haemaphysalis longicornis (50.1 %), H. flava (47.9 %), Ixodes nipponensis (1.7 %), and H. megaspinosa (0.3 %). This study reports the first detection of H. megaspinosa in the ROK. Pathogen screening detected Anaplasma spp. (minimum infection rate, MIR: 0.38 %), Babesia spp. (0.05 %), and Ehrlichia spp. (0.44 %); however, sequencing was only successful for Anaplasma spp. These findings highlight the importance of continued tick surveillance and research on the zoonotic risks associated with emerging tick species in the ROK.

AB  - The Sandwich Plate is known as one of the tectonically most active regions in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica, characterised by a subsurface chain of active volcanic islands (the South Sandwich Arc), submarine volcanic features, an earthquake rich area along the South Sandwich Trench and hydrothermal vents on segments of the East Scotia Ridge. In 2013 and 2019 we investigated eight potential hydrothermally active sites in the forearc, island arc and back arc of the Sandwich Plate from shallow (60 m) to abyssal (3886 m) depths. All Protector Seamounts sites, Protector Shoal, Quest Caldera, and an unnamed submarine volcano, showed thermal anomalies, as did the East Scotia Ridge segment E5 back arc site. At Quest Caldera, chimney structures, bacterial mats and mineral precipitates were observed in a depression on the caldera rim. The investigated forearc sites showed hydroacoustic, but not temperature anomalies. None of the sites showed evidence of megafauna associated with hydrothermal venting or hydrocarbon seep sites, but did have evidence of both unexpectedly dense and sparse communities of Southern Ocean taxa in the vicinities of the anomalies. Overall, our investigations showed that the benthic habitats and communities of the Sandwich Plate are still barely known.

AB  - The fish incidence, particularly notothenioids and myctophids, in the diet of non-breeding male Arctocephalus gazella in the western Antarctic Peninsula (AP) region is widely variable according to the studied locality. We made a comparative diet analysis on 158 fecal samples collected in summer 2005 at Hope Bay (HB), AP and at Stranger Point (SP), South Shetland Islands (SSI). The frequency of occurrence of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and fish as prey was similar at HB, whereas krill was predominant at SP. For each fish species identified based on the otoliths found, their relative importance in the diet was evaluated using the IRI index. Notothenioid fish prevailed at HB, Pleuragramma antarctica being the most important prey. Contrarily, the myctophids Gymnoscopelus nicholsi and Electrona antarctica predominated at SP. Both benthopelagic and pelagic fish species were represented at HB, while the latter were more important at SP. Demersal nototheniid species (e.g., Trematomus spp.) were scarcely represented and only at HB, which might be related to a preference of fur seals for the more abundant pelagic prey there. At SP, demersal nototheniids were not represented in the scats. The fish species consumption was higher in diversity at SP in comparison with HB but low in overlap between the two sites. We surmise that the differences found in the dietary composition of fur seals from both sites could be related to 1-different topographical and hydrological conditions associated to the study areas; 2-historical finfish fisheries, which took place during the late 1970s at the SSI, but not in the AP. Our findings are compared with studies from other localities of the AP and the Scotia Arc.

AB  - 1. Reintroduction programmes are an important tool for the conservation of threatened and endangered carnivores, but their effectiveness has rarely been assessed when wild-born, captive-raised orphans are released. 2.We monitored and evaluated the success of captive-raised orphaned cheetahs (n = 25) that were rehabilitated and released into the wild as adults across three private reserves in Namibia. We estimated time to independence, hunting success and prey composition, and for one reserve we derived prey preference and hunting habitat use. 3. Seventeen cheetahs achieved independence (68%) whereas eight were returned to captivity. With one exception, solitary or coalition cheetahs made their first kill 6 +/- 2 days post-release. Hunting success was on average 56%, with solitary females having the highest success. We documented 13 species of wild prey killed by rehabilitated cheetahs, primarily ungulates (n = 170). Steenbok (Raphicerus campestris) were the preferred prey, although avoided by artificially formed female cheetah coalitions, which primarily killed juvenile eland (Tragelaphus oryx). Cheetahs used a wide range of vegetation for hunting, although coalition males appeared to use somewhat denser areas. 4. Rehabilitated wild-born captive-reared cheetahs can be successfully released if prey availability and human-wildlife conflict potential are considered, and food supplementation and intensive monitoring are undertaken.

AB  - After the first introduction of African swine fever (ASF) in the European Union in 2014, the ASF virus (ASFV) has steadily spread in the European Union. The virus has occasionally been transmitted over unexpectedly large distances that are believed to be related to human-mediated spread. Hunting tourism has been mentioned as a potential contributor to these long-distance jumps, although evidence is lacking. In this study, the possible role of hunters carrying ASFV-contaminated wild boar products (WBP) from hunting trips in affected countries was evaluated. A quantitative risk model was developed to estimate the expected annual number of ASF exposures of wild boar and domestic pigs in the Netherlands via this introduction route. Main input data into the model were the ASF prevalence in hunted wild boar, the number and destination of hunting trips of Dutch hunters, and the probabilities that hunters take WBP home and dispose leftovers such that wild boar or domestic pigs have access. The model indicated that the total expected annual number of exposures (wild boar and domestic pigs together) in the Netherlands is 0.048 (95% uncertainty interval 7.5 x 10-3 - 0.15). Model results were most sensitive to uncertainty on leftovers fed to domestic pigs (swill feeding), which is an illegal practice. Uncertainties on the ASF prevalence of hunted wild boar and the probabilities that hunters take WBP home also impacted model results. Default model results were based on the 2019 situation. Alternative scenarios were run with the model to account for the change of ASF status of Belgium (recovery of ASF-free status) and Germany (ASF-infected) in 2020. Results indicated that especially the presence of ASF in Germany increased the incursion risk. However, this increase might be counteracted by a change in travel behavior of hunters.

AB  - The exploitation of deep-sea polymetallic nodules has attracted global attention. To mitigate its impact on deepsea ecosystems, accurate identification of benthic megafauna is essential for developing science-based mining strategies. Deep learning has emerged as an promising approach in biological identification, offering significantly improved efficiency and reduced reliance on taxonomic expertise. However, challenges such as similar species characteristics, occlusion, and species abundance imbalance hinder accurate recognition of deep-sea benthic megafauna. To address these issues, the present study proposes Benthic Megafauna-YOLO (BM-YOLO). backbone integrates deformable convolutions, attention mechanisms, and ResNet structures to improve feature extraction and reduce background interference. Additionally, a transformer-enhanced PAFPN incorporates global context, improving occluded target recognition. To address the challenge of low-abundance species, we introduce a varifocal head that enhances the focus of the model on rare species. To address the lack of relevant datasets, we constructed the Pacific Ocean Benthic Megafauna dataset using images collected during the China Oceanic 45 and 50 surveys. Notably, BM-YOLO achieved AP50 scores exceeding 90 % and 95 % for six and four species, respectively. Furthermore, the model achieved the mAP50 and mAP50:95 values of 85.9 % and 56.2 respectively, improving on YOLOv8s by 2.6 % and 4.6 % and YOLOv11s by 0.7 % and 1.5 %. On the public underwater dataset DUO, BM-YOLO achieved mAP50 and mAP50:95 values of 82.4 % and 62.7 %, respectively, outperforming YOLOv10s by 2.0 % and 2.9 %. These results highlight the potential of BM-YOLO in automated deep-sea species identification. We also identified key factors influencing species recognition accuracy through experimental analysis.

AB  - Hippoboscid flies, also known as louse flies, are obligate blood-feeders ectoparasites of birds and mammals. By studying louse fly parasites of four Passeriformes species, Eurasian blackbird (Turdus merula), Eurasian blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla), common chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs) and European robin (Erithacus rubecula), with dissimilar time of colonization of Azores islands, we tested whether: (i) island host populations have lower parasite richness than the mainland one; (ii) island host populations undergo higher parasite prevalence, mean intensities and mean abundance than the mainland one; (iii) island parasite diversity are composed exclusively by specific parasites and (iv) parasite richness is positively correlated with the island area and proximity to the continent. For these purposes, 775 birds were sampled for presence of louse flies, by modified fumigation chamber method, from Azores Islands (Sa?o Miguel, Terceira and Flores) and Portugal mainland. Insular and mainland parasite assemblages were statistically compared. We record for the first time to Azores, Ornithomya fringillina and Icosta minor from Portugal mainland. Louse flies had highest prevalence and abundance from Azores Islands compared to those observed in mainland birds, especially blackbirds. The insular parasite diversity of Azores blackbirds, blackcaps and chaffinches was richer than the one observed in mainland population. None of the hippoboscid flies observed on the islands and mainland were host-specific. Thus, our findings provide an upgrade of parasite island syndromes knowledge, in the context of the ectoparasites, namely to the hippoboscid flies case.

AB  - BACKGROUND Fences are one of the most widespread manmade features in nature, constituting an artificial limitation to the movement of wildlife. To date, their effects on wildlife behavior have been understudied but this knowledge is required to design effective management procedures. Using 21 GPS-monitored wild boar, we evaluated the permeability of different types of fences and described temporal patterns and spatial hotspots for crossing events. A fence's permeability was inferred by the crossing success, i.e., the number of times that animals crossed a barrier vs the number of times they did not cross. The vulnerability of fences at watercourses was explored by assessing whether the frequency of crossings was higher around watercourse intersections than expected by chance. RESULTS Well-maintained big game proof fences were the most effective in reducing successful wild boar crossings; they were, on average, 30% more efficient than livestock type fences. Crossing success was higher for males than females and during the food shortage period than in the food abundance period. The frequency of crossings around watercourses was higher than expected by chance, especially in moderately and well-maintained big game proof type fences. CONCLUSION While no fence type was 100% wild boar proof, well-maintained big game proof fences substantially constrained the movement of boar. However, they are vulnerable around watercourses. Managing the conflicts in which this species is involved, such as shared infections and agricultural damage, would require fences that are even more effective than the ones analyzed here, ideally in conjunction with other preventive actions.

AB  - The use of predator control as a conservation tool, for example to protect ground-nesting bird populations, remains a subject of ongoing debate. To justify the control or eradication of a predator, managers need to provide evidence on the success of the program. We evaluated the effectiveness of a raccoon dog control program (2021-2024) organized by governmental bodies around wetlands important for waterfowl conservation in Finland. The raccoon dog is an invasive species and a nest predator of waterfowl. We assessed control effectiveness by analysing how hunting methods and effort influenced catch and how varying hunting intensity across wetlands affected raccoon dog abundance measured with camera-traps. There was a moderate negative relationship between previous hunting efforts and monthly catch, indicating diminishing returns, but full eradication was not achieved. Among the four used hunting methods, hunting from dens proved the most efficient hunting method in relation to time used. The impact of catch on the subsequent number of camera-trap observations varied. Winter camera-trap data from feeding sites showed no decline in raccoon dog presence, potentially due to autumn immigration. However, hunting success showed a negative effect on raccoon dog camera-trap observations in spring (waterfowl breeding season), suggesting a substantial, but incomplete, raccoon dog population reduction. Consistent with this, raccoon dog predation of artificial nests decreased, without compensatory increases by other predator species, resulting overall in reduced nest predation. We conclude that control efforts reduce raccoon dog numbers and potentially benefit wetland bird species, but long-term success requires substantial and sustained effort.

AB  - Citizen science invites the public to participate in both scientific thinking and data collection. Citizen science adds new collaborators whose contributions help to gather or analyse data on a large scale particularly relevant for emerging questions about the distribution and abundance of organisms across space and time. Syngnathids are cryptic fishes that inhabits temperate and tropical sheltered, coastal marine waters. Pipefishes and seahorses are threatened by habitat loss and degradation. Unfortunately, data on biological and ecological aspects and population trends are rarely available in most species. More than half of the thirteen-syngnathid species inhabiting Spanish coasts are considered Data Deficient for population evaluation. Citizen science is an opportunity to improve data availability for the study of syngnathid population tendencies and monitoring. This contribution describes and discusses the approach followed by Sea Watchers citizen science platform. We analysed and discussed the data provided by the observers, and the distribution data of species based on citizen science surveillance. Citizen science achieved the expansion of spatial and temporal dataset of syngnathid distribution. However, the obtained information is affected by observers' behaviour and suggest that the observers performed focussed surveys to find individuals of these slow motion iconic fishes, introducing biases in the data.

AB  - Populations of the green turtle (Chelonia mydas), a mega-herbivore that consumes seagrasses, are recovering worldwide. Understanding green turtle adaptations to herbivory and responses to changes in seagrass availability will be critical to interpreting plant-herbivore interactions as green turtle populations continue to rebound. Ingesta particle size and diet composition of two green turtle foraging aggregations (Bermuda, 32.3 degrees N, 64.8 degrees W; U.S. Virgin Islands [USVI], 17.8 degrees N, 64.6 degrees W) in the Northwest Atlantic (NWA) were evaluated to assess the prevalence of herbivory across foraging sites and life stages, determine if there is an optimum ingesta particle size, and evaluate green turtle responses to changes in seagrass availability. Both aggregations were herbivorous (> 90% seagrass/algae) across size classes (straight carapace length, SCL). Ingesta particle size (mean +/- SD) did not differ between Bermuda (2.6 +/- 1.4 cm) and the USVI (2.3 +/- 1.2 cm). Of seagrass leaves ingested, 20-30% were 1.7 cm in length, indicating a potential optimum for maximizing digestion rates. Turtle size (SCL) had a significant effect on particle size in Bermuda (p = 0.01, R-2 = 0.16) (35.1 +/- 9.9 cm SCL) but not in the USVI aggregation, which was comprised of larger turtles (49.0 +/- 6.1 cm SCL). In Bermuda, there was no apparent response to the declines in seagrass availability. Ingesta particle size and volume of seagrass leaves did not decline from 2015 to 2019, nor was there an increase in volume of seagrass roots and rhizomes. These results indicate herbivory is prevalent across size classes at two NWA foraging sites and ingesta particle size has important implications for optimizing the green turtle grazing strategy and facilitating ontogenetic diet shifts to herbivory in juveniles. Ingesta particle size is a valuable tool for assessing green turtle responses to seagrass declines that should be interpreted within the context of population demographics.

AB  - Post-introduction evolution of plant defense traits is fundamental to several important theories for plant invasiveness. Research on chemical defense traits of invasive plants has focused mostly on targeted chemical analysis, however, such analyses restrict novel insights to known compounds. Here, we provide an untargeted metabolomic analysis of native and invasive Purple Loosestrife populations and we experimentally test if admixture between introduced populations provides a basis for rapid defense chemistry evolution. Invasive populations showed improved growth and generalist herbivore resistance, but lower resistance to a specialist weevil, consistent with the Shifting Defense Hypothesis of plant invasions. Metabolomic profiling revealed large shifts in chemistry between native and invasive populations, including differences in alkaloids and flavonoids. Experimental admixture increased chemical diversity and plant growth in the native populations, indicating its potential to fuel rapid evolution, but admixture did not affect generalist and specialist herbivory. Our untargeted metabolomics analysis provides novel insights in the evolutionary changes in the chemistry of invasive plants, and reveals the chemical associations of a shift from defenses against specialist to generalist herbivores in invasive populations.

AB  - Coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros; CRB) was discovered in 2015 in a small outbreak in Honiara, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands. This was the first record of CRB from Solomon Islands and a response plan was prepared. An awareness programme was launched and where CRB sightings were confirmed, delimitation surveys were carried out. Following the launch of the awareness programme, later in 2015, CRB was also reported from the Shortland Islands in the Western Province. Other islands were surveyed from 2015 to 2020. If CRB presence was confirmed, beetles were collected and analysed for haplotype and presence of the classical biological control agent, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV). A distribution map and timeline of invasion were developed. The initial populations belonged to two distinct haplotypes: CRB-G (clade I-A) in Honiara and CRB-S (clade II) in Shortland Islands. Despite control measures, by 2020 CRB-G had spread to islands in eight provinces and CRB-S had spread to islands in seven provinces. CRB-S and CRB-G co-occur in Guadalcanal and Malaita provinces. In 2019, OrNV was detected from field collected CRB from Guadalcanal and has since spread to Malaita Island. In both cases the virus was detected where CRB-G and CRB-S co-occur. Other outbreak areas in Solomon Islands remain OrNV-free. The two haplotypes appear to have spread following patterns of air and sea movement between the point of origin (CRB-G from Honiara and CRB-S from the Shortland Islands) to other islands/provinces.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are major drivers of biodiversity decline, reducing connectivity among populations and leading to genetic isolation, loss of diversity, increased inbreeding, and reduced fitness. Translocations that promote gene flow by introducing genetically distinct individuals-a process known as genetic rescue-can mitigate these effects by increasing genetic diversity, alleviating inbreeding, and improving adaptive capacity. However, a limited understanding of a population's demographic history, genetic differentiation, and connectivity can hinder the effective application of genetic rescue. We used the Stephens' kangaroo rat (Dipodomys stephensi), a species threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation in southern California, as a model for developing range-wide genetic management strategies. We analyzed mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite data to investigate genetic structure and estimate both historical and recent demographic patterns, and we used landscape resistance modeling to assess the impacts of natural and anthropogenic barriers on gene flow. Genetic analyses suggest a relatively recent diversification of Stephens' kangaroo rat populations, with higher allelic diversity concentrated in central populations and reduced diversity in isolated northern and southern populations. Although natural geographic features explain much of the genetic structure, landscape resistance models showed that anthropogenic barriers (e.g., roads, development) play a key role in current genetic isolation and are expected to continue driving population differentiation. To guide management, we used population viability simulations to test translocation strategies aimed at reversing genetic erosion. Repeated translocations were far more effective than single events at boosting heterozygosity and population persistence. The frequency and size of translocations were less important than their continued implementation. For very small populations, concurrent habitat restoration to increase carrying capacity was essential to prevent extirpation. Our findings highlight the value of integrating genetic, demographic, and landscape data into conservation planning. This approach is broadly applicable to other species experiencing habitat fragmentation and population isolation.

AB  - Background and Research Aims: Negative interactions with wildlife hinder biodiversity conservation, and attempts to devolve wildlife management to local communities near protected areas have had limited success. This study applied Citizen Science Theory (CST) as a bottom-up approach to examine the role of Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) in reducing human-wildlife conflicts in the eastern buffer zone of the Selous Game Reserve. Methods: Data were collected from 240 households through surveys, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. Qualitative data were analyzed via content analysis, while quantitative data were processed using SPSS version 26. Results: Following the establishment of WMAs, 67.5% and 83% of respondents reported decreases in illegal wildlife offtake and habitat destruction, respectively. However, incidents of crop damage, livestock predation, and human attacks caused by wild animals increased by 28.6%, 40.6%, and 79.2%, respectively. Regarding interaction patterns, annual crop damage was higher near WMAs, averaging 7.2 +/- 0.1 acres, compared to 0.6 +/- 0.1 acres in areas farther away. Similarly, approximately 83 livestock were attacked within 500 meters of WMA boundaries, while only 11 livestock were attacked beyond 30 kilometers. About 72% of respondents indicated that human attacks occurred primarily during farming activities, with lions, leopards, hyenas, crocodiles, elephants, buffalo, and hippopotamuses identified as the responsible species. Conclusion: We concluded that the expansion of wildlife habitats through a community-based conservation approach increased wildlife populations; however, it also heightened the challenges posed by wild animals to local communities. Implications for conservation: WMAs inception is paramount to wildlife conservation particularly those requiring large home ranges. Enhancing wildlife control by encouraging local monitoring, using sound and odor deterrents, and promoting public education on safely interacting with wild animals, strengthening traditional enclosures using predator-proof materials such as thorny bushes or modern steel fences to reduce nighttime attacks, should be prioritized to mitigate negative interactions with wildlife.

AB  - The present study aimed to (i) characterize the seasonal dynamics of coat morphology and skin evaporation (SE) as adaptive indicators, (ii) evaluate milk production and composition throughout the lactation period, and (iii) investigate the relationships between these adaptative traits and milk production in Majorera and Palmera goats raised on Tenerife Island (28 degrees N). Morphological data, skin evaporation and milk production (MP) and composition of 30 Majorera and 20 Palmera lactating and non-pregnant goats of similar reproductive age were collected over 18 months period. Except for coat diameter, all variables showed an interaction effect (p < 0.001) between season and breed. Coat thickness was greater (p < 0.001) in the Palmera breed than in Majorera goats in all seasons. Hair length was greater (p < 0.001) by more than 200% in Palmera goats than in Majorera goats in all seasons. Except for summer, skin evaporation (SE) was higher (p < 0.001) for the Palmera than Majorera. Majorera goats showed higher MP (p < 0.001) throughout all months of the lactation period compared to Palmera goats. The average total MP over the 210-day lactation period was 338.46 for Majorera and 207.3 L for Palmera. Regarding milk composition, Palmera goats had higher fat (p = 0.007) content than Majorera goats, whereas protein content was similar (p = 0.358) between breeds. Canonical correlation analysis indicated that the climate of Tenerife Island exerts a greater influence on coat morphological traits and SE in Palmera goats (r(c)(2)= 0.38; p < 0.001). These climate effects on adaptive traits showed a stronger tendency to be associated with MP (r(c)(2)= 0.29; p = 0.058). In contrast, although the climatic influence on morphological traits and SE was lower in Majorera goats (r(c)(2)=0.22; p < 0.001), these adaptive variables were not significantly related to MP (r(c)(2)=0.25; p = 0.160). Majorera and Palmera goats exhibited distinct seasonal responses in coat traits and SE under the climate of Tenerife. Palmera goats, with longer and denser coats, showed greater susceptibility to heat stress and a stronger tendency for adaptive traits to influence MP. In contrast, Majorera goats, whose coats favored heat dissipation, had higher MP and greater productive stability under environmental fluctuations. These findings highlight the importance of including coat traits in genetic improvement programs for dairy goats in temperate regions.

AB  - A central goal in ecology is to predict what governs a species' ability to establish in a new environment. One mechanism driving establishment success is individual species' traits, but the role of trait combinations among interacting species across different trophic levels is less clear. Deliberate or accidental species additions to existing communities provide opportunities to study larger scale patterns of establishment success. Biological control introductions are especially valuable because they contain data on both the successfully established and unestablished species. Here, we used a recent dataset of importation biological control introductions to explore how life-history traits of 132 parasitoid species and their herbivorous hosts interact to affect parasitoid establishment. We find that of five parasitoid and herbivore traits investigated, one parasitoid trait-host range-weakly predicts parasitoid establishment; parasitoids with higher levels of phylogenetic specialization have higher establishment success, though the effect is marginal. In addition, parasitoids are more likely to establish when their herbivore host has had a shorter residence time. Interestingly, we do not corroborate earlier findings that gregarious parasitoids and endoparasitoids are more likely to establish. Most importantly, we find that life-history traits of the parasitoid species and their hosts can interact to influence establishment. Specifically, parasitoids with broader host ranges are more likely to establish when the herbivore they have been released to control is also more of a generalist. These results provide insight into how multiple species' traits and their interactions, both within and across trophic levels, can influence establishment of species of higher trophic levels.

AB  - Despite being resident or reintroduced to multiple South African protected areas, spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) have been subject to limited population monitoring and are not managed in the same intensive way as other large carnivores. Considering the species' significant influence on ecosystem processes, robust estimates of population density are necessary to inform conservation management. In this study, we ran a single-season camera trap survey in the Main Camp section of Addo Elephant National Park (Addo), South Africa, and used spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models to estimate spotted hyaena population density. Spotted hyaena density was estimated to be 11.13 (+/- SE 1.96) individuals/100 km(2), with an estimated abundance of 37 (+/- SE 6.44) individuals. Using our database of sexed spotted hyaena individuals, we found no significant difference for sex-specific SCR parameters (baseline encounter probability and spatial scale parameter), suggesting the incorporation of sex-specific information may not be as necessary for spotted hyaena as it is for territorial felids and other species with more pronounced differences in range size. Spotted hyaena density in Addo was comparable to previous SCR studies and towards the higher end of known densities. Our estimate provides an important baseline for monitoring reintroduction success in Addo, and we advocate for increased SCR monitoring of spotted hyaena in South African protected areas to inform a metapopulation approach to the species' management.

AB  - Reproductive success in flowering plants depends on floral biology, breeding system, and availability of compatible mates and pollinators. Here, we examine the pollination biology of Linum arenicola (Small) H.J.P Winkler (Linaceae), sand flax, a federally endangered herb of pine rocklands in the Lower Florida Keys (USA). We observed the timing of floral anthesis, fruiting, florivory, and frequency of flower visits by insects. We compared fruiting in flowers that were open-pollinated, bagged to exclude floral visitors, and self-pollinated by hand to determine whether pollinator visits enhance or are necessary for reproduction. Fruit set was equally high be-tween flowers open to pollinators and those that were hand-pollinated, but both were significantly higher compared to flowers from which pollinators were excluded. We observed that the wilting of petals late in the day in unvisited flowers often initiates self-pollination, but flowers are frequently visited by small bees and flies earlier in the day, suggesting that early day visits by those insects increase pollen deposition and potential for outcrossing. Despite high fruit set from autonomous self-pollination and occasional flower visitation, sexual reproduction is limited by herbivores: nearly half of all flowers produced were consumed by Key deer and galling midges. Optimum fruit set is not achieved from autonomous selfing alone, and pollinators play an important role in fruit production of the rare sand flax. Conservation efforts that enhance populations of suitable pollinators could increase the likelihood of fruit set from a diversity of pollen parents in rare plants like the endangered sand flax.

AB  - Rhizosphere microbes play pivotal roles in regulating the soil ecosystem by influencing and directly participating in the nutrient cycle. Evidence shows that the rhizosphere microbes are highly dependent on plant genotype and cultivars; however, their characteristics in soils with different tea (Camellia sinensis L.) cultivars are poorly understood. Therefore, the present study investigated the rhizosphere soil properties, microbial community composition, and their potential functions under four tea cultivars Huangjinya (HJY), Tieguanyin (TGY), Zhongcha No.108 (ZC108), and Zijuan (ZJ). The study found a minor impact of cultivars on rhizosphere soil properties but a significant influence on microbial community structure. Except for available potassium (AK) (HJY > TGY > ZC108 > ZJ), tea cultivars had no significant impact on other soil properties. The tea cultivars resulted in substantial differences only in the diversity of soil bacteria of lower taxonomic levels (family to species), as well as significantly changed communities' structure of bacteria and fungi (R-2 = 0.184, p = 0.013 and R-2 = 0.226, p = 0.001). Specifically, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteriota, and Firmicutes accounted for approximately 96% of the bacterial phyla in the tea soils, while Ascomycota, Mortierellomycota, Rozellomycota, Basidiomycota, and Monoblepharomycota (90% of the total) predominated the soil fungal community. Redundancy analysis (RDA) identified soil pH (14.53%) and ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N; 16.74%) as the key factors for the changes in bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. Finally, FAPROTAX analysis predicted significant differences in the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (C-N-S)-cycling among the soils with different tea cultivars, specifically, ZJ cultivar showed the highest C-cycling but the lowest N- and S-cycling, while FUNGuild analysis revealed that the pathotroph group was significantly lower in ZC108 than the other cultivars. These findings improve our understanding of the differences in microbial community characteristics among tea cultivars and provide a basis for precisely selecting and introducing excellent tea varieties in the agriculture practices.

AB  - Granivorous rodents have been traditionally regarded as antagonistic seed predators. Agoutis (Dasyprocta spp.), however, have also been recognized as mutualistic dispersers of plants because of their role as scatter-hoarders of seeds, especially for large-seeded species. A closer look shows that such definitions are too simplistic for these Neotropical animals because agoutis can influence plant communities not only through seed dispersal of large seeds but also through predation of small seeds and seedlings, evidencing their dual role. Herein, we summarize the literature on plant-agouti interactions, decompose agouti seed dispersal into its quantitative and qualitative components, and discuss how environmental factors and plant traits determine whether these interactions result in mutualisms or antagonisms. We also look at the role of agoutis in a community context, assessing their effectiveness as substitutes for extinct megafaunal frugivores and comparing their ecological functions to those of other extant dispersers of large seeds. We also discuss how our conclusions can be extended to the single other genus in the Dasyproctidae family (Myoprocta). Finally, we examine agoutis' contribution to carbon stocks and summarize current conservation threats and efforts. We recorded 164 interactions between agoutis and plants, which were widespread across the plant phylogeny, confirming that agoutis are generalist frugivores. Seed mass was a main factor determining seed hoarding probability of plant species and agoutis were found to disperse larger seeds than other large-bodied frugivores. Agoutis positively contributed to carbon storage by preying upon seeds of plants with lower carbon biomass and by dispersing species with higher biomass. This synthesis of plant-agouti interactions shows that ecological services provided by agoutis to plant populations and communities go beyond seed dispersal and predation, and we identify still unanswered questions. We hope to emphasise the importance of agoutis in Neotropical forests.

AB  - Body size is a key morphological attribute, often used to delimit species boundaries among closely related taxa. But body size can evolve in parallel, reaching similar final states despite independent evolutionary and geographic origins, leading to faulty assumptions of evolutionary history. Here, we document parallel evolution in body size in the widely distributed leaf-nosed bat genus Hipposideros, which has misled both taxonomic and evolutionary inference. We sequenced reduced representation genomic loci and measured external morphological characters from three closely related species from the Solomon Islands archipelago, delimited by body size. Species tree reconstruction confirms the paraphyly of two morphologically designated species. The nonsister relationship between large-bodied H. dinops lineages found on different islands indicates that large-bodied ecomorphs have evolved independently at least twice in the history of this radiation. A lack of evidence for gene flow between sympatric, closely related taxa suggests the rapid evolution of strong reproductive isolating barriers between morphologically distinct populations. Our results position Solomon Islands Hipposideros as a novel vertebrate system for studying the repeatability of parallel evolution under natural conditions. We conclude by offering testable hypotheses for how geography and ecology could be mediating the repeated evolution of large-bodied Hipposideros lineages in the Solomon Islands.

AB  - Natural areas in cities are important refugia for wildlife, but some species also use developed areas. Such adaptation may be facilitated at the ecotone between natural and residential areas where wildlife encounter anthropogenic resources. We quantified human activities and objects that potentially attract coyotes (Canis latrans) by providing shelter, food, prey habitat, and novelty items where backyards back onto natural areas in Edmonton, Canada. We related attractant abundance and human demographic variables to coyote access to backyards, scat abundance, and the number and nature of reports detailing interactions with coyotes near the ecotone. Among 468 surveyed backyards, 31% were accessed by coyotes, and we detected 2055 instances of attractants. Coyotes selectively accessed unfenced backyards with food and novelty items, and backyard access was most common along transects where fences were infrequent, and shelter was abundant. Evidence of deer on transects was weakly correlated with increased prevalence of scats. Public reports describing conflict with coyotes were more frequent in areas with more coyote access to backyards, fewer fences, and more shelter. Weak evidence indicated that food abundance, scat prevalence, and backyard access were higher in areas with larger houses and more university-educated and retired residents. These results suggest that coyotes frequently access attractants at the ecotone between natural and residential areas, which may promote habituation, food conditioning, and human-wildlife conflict. These effects could be reduced, and coexistence could be promoted with clearer boundaries separating natural and residential areas, opposing conventional recommendations for reserve design that encourage gradual transition zones.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous parasite increasingly detected in marine mammals and suspected to contribute to limited recovery of endangered populations. This study reports on the exposure of the Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) to this protozoon using archived adult and pup sera from three island colonies in South Australia. Modified agglutination testing (MAT) detected a seroprevalence of 30.4% (95% CI 13.2-52.9: n = 23) and high antibody titers (512 to > 2048 IU/ml) in adult females (median age 9.5 y, range 5.5-14.5 y) at Dangerous Reef, a felid-free island. Antibodies weren't detected in any surveyed pup (97.5% CI 0.0-2.0%, n = 184) at two felid-free islands (Dangerous Reef: n = 21; Olive Island: n = 65), nor at Kangaroo Island (n = 98), which has a high-density feral cat population. Kangaroo Island pups of known age were 7-104 d old, while standard length and bodyweight comparison suggested younger and older pup cohorts at Dangerous Reef and Olive Island, respectively. This study provides the first quantification of disease risk in this endangered species from T. gondii exposure. The absence of detectable pup seroconversion supports the lack of detectable congenital transmission, maternal antibody persistence or early post-natal infection in the sampled cohort yet to commence foraging. An extended serosurvey of N. cinerea colonies is recommended to confirm the hypothesis of predominantly forage-associated exposure to T. gondii in this species. Findings have implications for parasitic disease risk in wildlife inhabiting Australia's islands and for the feral cat control program on Kangaroo Island.

AB  - Grazing fish play a role of controlling autochthonous primary production and converting it to secondary production by consuming benthic algae. Moreover, they will also provide autochthonous particulate organic matter (POM) for freshwater ecosystems by dislodging the benthic algal matrix while feeding. However, it has not been confirmed whether grazing fish induce POM production during their feeding on benthic algae. To verify this POM production during grazing by fish, short-term (90 min) feeding experiments were conducted by introducing grazing fish Plecoglossus altivelis into indoor aquaria with benthic algal mats. We found that the fish can generate POM by feeding on benthic algae. Although POM was generated in the aquaria where the fish had not grazed on the benthic algal mats at all, the concentration of POM in the aquaria increased with the frequency of the acts of scraping benthic algae by the fish. Furthermore, we observed that the fish egested faeces which corresponded to about 44% on average of the ingested benthic organic matter. In some cases, the fish generated POM that corresponded to 88% of the removed (dislodged and ingested) benthic organic matter through their feeding and defecation. This study suggested that grazing fish have a function of providing autochthonous POM to freshwater ecosystems both via dislodging benthic algae during feeding and through egestion of consumed benthic algae.

AB  - Herbivorous fish are generally considered to be diurnal feeders, but the disappearance of seaweeds at night has been observed in Japan. We conducted field experiments using an infra-red time-lapse camera to identify fish browsing on seaweed at night at two sites on Fukue Island, western Japan. At both sites, brown chub (Kyphosus bigibbus) were photographed around transplanted seaweed from sunset to sunrise, and the seaweed declined after the appearance of K. bigibbus. This study is the first report of nocturnal browsing in a purely herbivorous fish.

AB  - Introduction Xenophyophores are large benthic agglutinated Foraminifera that are a major component of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone megafauna.Methods Two xenophyophore specimens were obtained and submitted to genomic investigations.Results For both specimens, it was possible to obtain a ca. 25 kb circular xenophyophore-associated mitochondrial genome (XAM) showing similar gene contents with other Retaria, with which they are associated by a maximum likelihood multiprotein phylogeny. One of the specimens yielded a complete cluster of nuclear rRNA genes, the first to be obtained from a xenophyophore. Another full cluster of rRNA, likely belonging to Endomyxa parasites, was found within both specimens.Discussion Although the agglutinated nature of xenophyophores currently prevents a definitive conclusion, the mitogenomes obtained may represent the first to be obtained from those foraminifera. Deeper enquiries are required in order to properly ascribe these genomes to their host organism and to clarify the nature of the possibly parasitic Rhizaria associated with the xenophyophores.

AB  - Electric fences are an effective means of mitigating human-wildlife conflict; however, some fences are not impenetrable and allow some animal intrusion. This study revealed the most appropriate height of fence lines for target species and whether line tension affected their effectiveness. Nine study plots were used, and an equilateral triangular area of 3.2 m per side (4.43 m(2)) was enclosed by an electric fence. Electric lines were set at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, and 160 cm, and all lines were connected to the positive terminal of an energizer. The following electric fence conditions were provided for the animals: (i) three levels of voltage (1500, 4000, and 10,000 V), (ii) two types of grounding (soil and metal mesh), and (iii) two levels of line tension. There were nine target species. Two cameras were set up in each study plot, and attractants were placed inside and outside the fence. Animals were observed and recorded both inside and outside the fence. The most touched height of the electric lines was half the adult shoulder height of each species. In addition, the height at which most animals passed through the fence was below their shoulder height. Moreover, high-tensile electric fences were twice as likely to electrify animals than low-tensile fences. These results highlight the importance of understanding the height and tension of electric lines. Thus, the fence line should be set at a high tension and lower than half of the shoulder height of the target species.

AB  - 1. Wildlife translocation is an important conservation tool for restoring species and reducing global biodiversity decline; however, this practice is challenging for wildlife, and translocated individuals must adjust to their release landscapes for restoration success. The period following release is a vulnerable time for wildlife and determining when animals acclimate following translocation improves long-term estimates of population dynamics and allows researchers to efficiently tailor translocation design and post-release management to each population's needs.2. We evaluated demographic acclimation and investigated changes in post-release survival of a population of 106 elk Cervus canadensis translocated to Missouri, USA, in 2011-2013 using generalized survival modelling. We defined the acclimation period as the duration of time prior to stabilization in mortality risk relative to time from release, and we evaluated acclimation duration from flexible plots of estimated mortality hazards across time. We simultaneously investigated factors contributing to post-release survival and compared survival rates and mortality sources observed during acclimation and post-acclimation periods.3. Elevated mortality risk for translocated elk spanned a 5-month acclimation period following release, with an additional 1-year period reflecting reduced, but still elevated, mortality hazards. Baseline hazards during the initial 5-month acclimation period were approximately four times higher than the subsequent 4.4 years following release.4. Release cohort, but not age class or sex, was associated with post-release mortality risk, and mortality sources within the acclimation period tended to be undetermined with greater frequency relative to mortalities occurring after the acclimation period.5. Our results highlight the utility of flexible modelling approaches to evaluate dynamic post-release responses of translocated populations. Translocated elk demonstrated a pronounced demographic acclimation period that spanned 5 months following release. Changes in mortality sources and the timing of stabilization in mortality hazards suggest that demographic acclimation in translocated elk was associated with adjustments in physiological stress and movement rates which stabilized over a similar post-release duration. Improving post-release monitoring and assessment of restored populations by evaluating temporal dynamics of manifold biological and ecological responses as translocated animals acclimate to their new landscapes is vital to successful restoration efforts.

AB  - The prickly pear (Opuntia megasperma var. orientalis), a pivotal species for the ecological balance of Espanola Island in Galapagos, has witnessed a severe decline in its population due to the enduring presence of introduced feral goats over several decades. Additionally, the inherent slow recovery of this species, requiring several years of development, has contributed to its population decline. Several attempts were carried out to restore this species, but they were not successful due to the island's extreme arid conditions. Subsequently, innovative water-saving technologies were introduced to ensure the survival and growth of the Opuntia species. Two water-saving technologies, Groasis Waterboxx (R) and Hydrogel, were applied in two distinct treatments, the first involving Waterboxx solely, and the second combining Waterboxx with Hydrogel, alongside a control group. Planting involved two types of cacti: cladodes and seedlings. To safeguard against potential damage from giant tortoises and local birds, protective mesh fencing was installed around the plants. Each monitoring session recorded plant survival and growth, evaluating the impact of water-saving technologies on cactus survival, maximum plant height reached, age at the time of plant death, and growth achieved since planting. Additionally, the study assessed the influence of climate on plant survival and growth. Unfortunately, the employment of protective mesh fences and Waterboxx containers resulted in the unintended loss of specific bird species. Consequently, a decision was taken to remove these protective measures, resulting in a substantial rise in herbivorous activity, and the subsequent mortality of nearly all plants. Our findings underscore the efficacy of water-saving technologies in Opuntia restoration. However, successful application necessitates a better understanding of these technologies within the unique conditions of the island. Future endeavors should focus on refining these techniques to minimize avian mortality while fostering biodiversity and restoring ecological equilibrium.

AB  - To elucidate genetic variability in vigilance behaviour for reindeer with historical differences in their interactions with predators and humans, we measured vigilance frequency and duration for grazing reindeer in Southern Norway (Rondane and Norefjell-Reinsjofjell), Svalbard (Edgeoya and Nordenskiold Land) and Barf/Royal Bay and Busen in the southern Hemisphere (South Georgia). Averaged for all areas, frequency and duration of vigilance bouts were less than 0.5 and 2.5 s, respectively. Frequency was insignificantly 1.3 times higher in Rondane than Edgeoya, and significantly 2.0, 3.5, 5.2 and 12.4 times higher than Norefjell, Nordenskiold Land, Barf/Royal Bay and Busen, respectively. Duration per vigilance bout was not different amongst the areas. Thus, while frequency varied considerably, duration remained constant, supporting a hard-wired adaptation to, among other suggestions, an open landscape. Plasticity in frequency allows for flexible behavioral responses to environmental factors with predation, domestication and hunting key drivers for reindeer. Other factors include (1) the open, treeless alpine/Arctic environment inhabited by Rangifer subspecies allowing warning time, (2) grouping behaviour, (3) relative low density of predators and (4) the anatomy and physiology of ungulate vision.

AB  - Research Highlights: The regeneration of Quercus species is usually very difficult in many oak woodlands transformed by livestock farming. Some studies have reported that shrubs can facilitate regeneration. However, the strength of interaction may vary depending on, among other factors, the shrub species and the stress tolerance of the oak species. Moreover, further studies are necessary to clarify the relative importance of the two facilitation mechanisms in the same community. Background and Objectives: Cytisus multiflorus (L'Her.) Sweet is a predominant shrub species in the Mediterranean grazed open-oak-woodlands found in the central west of the Iberian Peninsula (bioclimatic limit) and is present with Quercus pyrenaica Willd and Quercus ilex subsp. ballota Samp trees. Thus, we assessed the effect of these native shrubs and acorn size, and the effect of excluding large herbivores, on the seedling emergence of two contrasting co-occurring Quercus species under a bioclimatic limit. Materials and Methods: A manipulative field experiment was carried out considering four treatments as a combination of shrubs (shrub/no-shrub) and fence (fenced/open) factors. A total of twenty plots, five replicates for each treatment were available. In each plot, 20 acorns were sown: 10 acorns (5 small and 5 large) for each Quercus species. Acorn emergence was recorded during the first four years following the sowing. Results: Seedling emergence took place mostly in the spring of the first year after sowing. The presence of shrub was the main significant factor and incremented the emergence of both Q. ilex and Q. pyrenaica. The effect of the fence depended on the Quercus species considered, improving only the emergence of Q. pyrenaica. A negative effect with the small acorns was detected but only for Q. pyrenaica. In all treatments, Q. ilex emerged more than Q. pyrenaica. Conclusions: C. multiflorus had a clear facilitative effect on the seedling emergence of Q. ilex and Q. pyrenaica, which was much greater than the physical effect that acorn size and excluding large herbivores had. As such, this native shrub may have a key role in oak regeneration in Mediterranean grazed areas. Furthermore, in these areas of contact between marcescent and sclerophyllous Quercus species, Q. ilex currently emerges more than Q. pyrenaica. This could be indicative of a shift towards more xeric climatic conditions, which could lead to a change in the dominant tree species in the future. However, this change could be modulated by the effects of native shrub and large herbivores.

AB  - Bushmeat consumption and trade plays a relevant role in many tropical countries as a source of protein and income for rural populations. In Madagascar, rural populations depend heavily on natural resources and wildlife as source of income and protein. The bushpig (Potamochoerus larvatus) is the largest mammal available in the island and regularly hunted. However, little is known about the importance and characteristics of this activity and its implication as a potential source of pathogens for both humans and domestic animals. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2014-2015 in five different regions of rural Madagascar suspected to have significant bushpig populations to (i) quantify and characterize the importance of bushpig hunting, (ii) assess the socioeconomic impact of bushpig trade, (iii) evaluate the potential pathogen transmission between bushpigs, domestic pigs and humans. A total of 77 hunters, 10 butchers and 95 pig farmers were individually interviewed. Hunting seasonality and the perception of local hunters with regards to the dynamics of bushpig populations in the last decade differed between the tropical dry and tropical sub-arid climatic zones. The top reason for hunting bushpigs was crop protection but personal consumption and selling of meat were also common. Hunting efficacy was largely dependent on the technique used. Snares and traps, the most widely used techniques, allowed the majority of hunters to catch from one to 10 bushpigs per year. Limited commercial bushpig trade was observed with only 0.8 bushpig sold in average per year and per hunter, representing a 16 USD income. The average price per kilo sold was USD 0.8 and the average profit received by each butcher/collector after the sale of a carcass was USD 11.9. No perception of disease risks nor precautions were taken to prevent potential pathogen transmission from bushpig to humans or pigs. Most of the hunters (68%) indicated that they had never seen a diseased bushpig. Bushpig hunting in our study areas in Madagascar was basically a small-scale subsistence hunting, very different from commercial bushmeat hunting described in areas of Central Africa or the Amazon Basin. More research is needed to verify the sustainability of bushpig hunting and its potential role in terms of reducing pressure on other endemic wildlife species and transmitting pathogens to humans and pigs.

   center dot The fate of some mammal species in the 2019-20 wildfires was a high-profile emblematic - concern for the community, with such attention catalysing concerted responses by many organisations.
   center dot The impacts of the wildfires were superimposed on a prevalent pattern of decline for many Australian mammals.
   center dot Post- fire recovery of many mammal species will be challenging, given the individual and compounding impacts of other threats and a changing fire regime likely to be characterised by more frequent comparable fires.
   center dot On-ground research following the 2019-20 wildfires has provided some evidence about population-level impacts at some sites.
   Main findings
   The 2019-20 wildfires burnt at least 50% of the distributions of five mammal species and 30-50% of the distributions of a further 18 mammal species.
   center dot Including subspecies, the most extreme fire overlap (95% of range burnt) was for the Kangaroo Island dunnart (Sminthopsis griseoventer aitkeni).
   center dot Post- fire sampling has confirmed marked population losses in burnt areas for a range of mammals, especially where fires were of high severity.
   center dot Population losses due to the 2019-20 wildfires are likely to have been of sufficient magnitude to render five mammal taxa newly eligible for listing as threatened.
   center dot Many government agencies and other groups instituted management interventions in the immediate aftermath of the fires. These efforts are likely to have achieved some local benefits.
   center dot Most of the fire-affected mammal species are unlikely to recover to their pre-fire population size over the next decade; and ongoing decline of many species is likely should comparable fires recur in the future.

AB  - Introduction: Seagrasses are a key habitat for the green turtle (Chelonia mydas). At Cahuita National Park (CNP), seagrass have been monitored since 1999. Over time, the canopy complexity of the dominant seagrass species (Thalassia testudinum) has declined. However, seagrass spatial variability and the turtle's interactions with meadows at Cahuita remain poorly studied. Objective: We aimed to assess the distribution and composition of seagrass meadows in CNP and quantify the intensity of C. mydas herbivory. Methods: Seagrass meadows characterization was done in 2019 and 2021. Sampling points were distributed systematically every 200 m. When seagrasses were present, points were sampled every 50 m for greater resolution. Water depth and seagrass cover by species were quantified at each point. In 2019, additional metrics included sediment carbon content, shoot density, photosynthetic biomass, and leaf area index. Sea turtle density was calculated using aerial video transects, and abundance estimated from density and reef lagoon area. Herbivory rates were estimated by seagrass tethering experiments and underwater videos in 2021. Results: Seagrass meadows were found at depths between 0.4 and 5.3 m. Mean sediment organic carbon was 2 % and increased slightly at higher seagrass biomass. Carbonate was 40 % and did not vary spatially. Seagrasses at CNP were dominated by T. testudinum, with minimal presence of Syringodium filiforme, Halodule wrightii, and Halophila decipiens. Between 2019 and 2021, seagrass cover declined by 52 %, from 54.7 to 24.7 ha in the area sampled both years. Sea turtle length ranged from 20 to 80 cm. Estimated density was 0.6 +/- 0.6 turtles/ha and abundance was 36 to 211 turtles within the reef lagoon. Underwater videos showed that C. mydas is the main herbivore of T. testudinum in the meadow, with herbivory rates from 12 to 182 cm(2)/s. Conclusions: Chelonia mydas plays a significant role in shaping seagrass canopy complexity and distribution at CNP, highlighting the need for integrated ecological monitoring and conservation efforts, particularly under the challenges posed by climate change and anthropogenic pressures.

AB  - Here, we provide an overview on Reeves' muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) in Austria, a deer species originating from southeastern China and introduced to Europe at the end of the 19(th) century. Muntiacus reevesi is currently established in several countries of the European mainland and the British Isles, and was included in the list of invasive alien species of Union concern, due to its potential detrimental impacts, such as feeding damage, competition, and car accidents. In Austria three confirmed observations of Reeves' muntjac in the wild were reported, in the federal states Salzburg, Upper Austria and Styria. All observations were made between 2016 and 2022 and were of single individuals that had likely escaped from captivity. Most recently, in April 2022 in Upper Austria a male individual has been observed for several days and was captured thereafter. Although to date there is no evidence of persistent populations in the wild, we argue that future establishment of the species in Austria is possible due to several factors. Those include the ongoing spread of Reeves' muntjac in several countries of the European mainland, its elusive lifestyle and low detectability in initial invasion stages, as well as its ability to thrive from very small founding populations. In the light of the precautionary principle, we advocate for careful monitoring and rapid reaction while still feasible.

AB  - AimsTransformation of species and functional composition on subtropical reefs are ongoing due to poleward range shifts of some tropical species, with largely unknown consequences to ecosystem functioning. Trait-based approaches are powerful tools to quantify such changes. Here, we evaluated changes in the trait composition of coral-associated fish assemblages along a tropical-to-temperate environmental gradient of ca. 1400 km in southern Japan with abundance-weighted trait expression to assess how trait composition changes with increasing latitude.LocationRyukyu Islands and southern Pacific coast of Japan.TaxonReef fish.MethodsWe tested for shifts in trait space and functional redundancy, based on five morphological, life history and behavioural traits: maximum length, pelagic larval duration, trophic level, substrate preference and reproductive mode. Our trait database was coded with two approaches, first, by attributing a single value to each trait per species, and second, by fuzzy coding that allows more than one value per trait and hence considers some intraspecific trait variation.ResultsWe found a reduction in specialist habitat traits (coral substrate preference, nesters and herbivores) and an increase in generalist traits (predators) with increasing latitude, along with a contraction in trait space from tropical-to-temperate reefs. Functional redundancy declined with increasing latitude. These trends were closely linked with latitudinal gradients in temperature, along with changes in other environmental factors such as turbidity and photosynthetically active radiation.Main ConclusionFunctional turnover and contractions are thus likely due to the marginal conditions for coral-associated fishes at higher latitudes, favouring generalist species, whereas increased resources at lower latitudes favour high redundancy and niche partitioning. Accounting for intraspecific trait variation indicated the same trends but highlighted increased functional vulnerability across all sites. We show that trait complexity in coral-associated fish communities decreases from tropical-to-temperate reefs, highlighting the reduced functional scope that comes with marginal environmental conditions.

AB  - Identifying sources, transfer, conversion and retention of diet sources in consumers of aquatic and terrestrial food webs is essential to understand how dietary nutrients are conveyed within and across ecosystems. Here we review current knowledge of trophic biomarkers and introduce state-of-the-art research of diet tracers. In addition to commonly used bulk stable isotopes we synthesise how lipids and their fatty acids are used as diet tracers in aquatic and terrestrial food webs and pay particular attention to recently developed compound-specific stable isotopes of fatty acids and show how carbon and hydrogen stable isotopes of fatty acids can be applied to answer questions of ecosystem-specific diet sources and endogenous conversion of ingested fatty acids. We provide examples of organisms in aquatic food webs and present data showing that hydrogen stable isotopes of fatty acids (d2HFA) vary much more strongly than their carbon stable isotopes (d13CFA), indicating that d2HFA values are more sensitive to environmental and ecophysiological changes than d13CFA values. This chapter covers examples of diet tracers in aquatic and terrestrial food webs and finishes with perspectives on diet source characterisation using fatty acids and stable isotopes, and a combination thereof of terrestrial, aquatic and avian food webs.

AB  - African Swine Fever (ASF) is a contagious viral disease of domestic and wild pigs, listed as notifiable by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). It causes substantial economic losses to pig farming in the affected countries, with consequent enormous damage to livestock production due to mortality of the animals, and to the restrictions on national and international trade in pigs and derivative products that the presence of the infection implies. To prevent or reduce the risk of ASF introduction, the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the OIE recommend preventive and control measures, such as the ban of live swine and their products traded from ASF-affected to ASF-free countries or zones. The current spread of ASF into Europe poses a serious risk to the industrialized and small-scale pig sector, as demonstrated by observed cases in different EU areas. In this paper the authors discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ASF, and the indirect effects including the impact on animal health and disease management. They suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected animal disease surveillance control. ASF requires rapid responses and continuous monitoring to identify outbreaks and prevent their spread, and both aspects may have been greatly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - <bold>Dubautia haupuensis </bold>is newly described from windswept ridgelines near the summit of H & amacr;upu, in an isolated range noted for floristic endemism on Kauai, in the Hawaiian Islands, where only two clusters of plants are currently known. Based on molecular phylogenetic data, this highly endangered shrub of the Hawaiian silversword alliance belongs to a recently resolved clade of endemic Kauai taxa, mostly from wet or bog habitats, including D. imbricata subsp. acronaea, D. imbricata subsp. imbricata, D. kalalauensis, D. kenwoodii, D. laevigata, D. syndetica, and D. waialealae. Unlike its close relatives and other members of Dubautia, D. haupuensis has the following unique combination of morphological characteristics: well-branched shrubs with leaves opposite, sessile, and glabrous, leaf venation +/- parallelodromous, with 5 to 9 basal nerves, capitulescences densely corymbiform to paniculiform, peduncles hirsute, peduncular bracts lance-linear to ovate, with faces glabrous and margins ciliate, heads 7- to 12-flowered, paleate throughout, the paleae each partially clasping a floret, with faces glabrous and distal margins ciliate, corolla tube/throat sessile-glandular, the throat dilated <= 2 x tube width, and pappus +/- equaling corolla, of 20 to 31 setiform to narrowly subulate, densely ciliate scales, the cilia < 0.5 mm long. It also is distinguished from all other taxa of the silversword alliance by diagnostic nuclear ribosomal DNA nucleotide states. Six of the seven taxa that constitute a clade with D. haupuensis have highly restricted distributions on Kauai and are of significant conservation concern, as reflected by listing of most of them as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Dubautia haupuensis is also exceedingly rare and in need of immediate conservation action to prevent its extinction. Invasive plants (especially melastomes), potential ungulate activity, lack of opportunity for outcrossing, and any mortality from stochastic events are major threats to the species, in addition to possible impacts of anthropogenic climate change.

AB  - Using the 16 S rDNA high-throughput sequencing, the effects of interplanted pecan (Carya illinoinensis) in a typical tea (Camellia sinensis) plantation on soil bacterial species composition and marker species were comparatively analyzed to determine whether nested pecan increases soil microbial diversity in the tea tree rhizosphere. We explored the effects of the underlying mechanisms of this complex ecosystem on tea quality by determining soil physicochemical properties using two types of planting modes: intercropping with pecan versus tea tree monoculture. Our results showed that Rhizobium (Allorhizobium, Neorhizobium, Pararhizobium, and Rhizobium), and Enterobacter, had pollution-degrading effects and were enriched in the soil bacterial communities of the pecan interplanted model. There was a significant enrichment of prebiotic functional bacteria, such as Pedosphaeraceae and Coriobateriaceae_UCG-002, which stimulate plant growth and improve disease resistance, while the functions of Chloroflexi and Firmicutes, which are dominant denitrifying bacteria in the soil, were inhibited. The average degree of soil microbial co-occurrence network increased from 13.40 to 18.17, and the number of nodes in the network increased from 117 to 166, indicating that the network increased in complexity and decreased in mutual exclusivity, and the complex interactions among bacterial populations tended to be stable. The intercropping mode reduced the phenol/ammonia ratio in tea from 2.37 to 1.38, improving the tea quality. Therefore, the soil microbial community composition under this complex model promotes material cycling in microecosystems and effectively reduces the transmission risk of soil-borne diseases. The soil microbial community structure of the tea rhizosphere could be re-balanced and shifted toward a more favorable tea quality formation by the introduction of pecan into tea plantations.

AB  - Teaching ecological concepts and field methods for introductory biology courses can be challenging, especially when class sizes are large and activities or topics depend on environmental conditions that can change dramatically from semester to semester. We provide a laboratory module that can be used throughout the year, where students can explore plant-insect interactions on campus trees in urban environments using nondestructive measures. Students are provided a transparent grid, a measuring tape, and a random selection protocol to estimate gloomy scale (Melanaspis tenebricosa) insect density on preselected Acer rubrum tree trunks. Students are also given a pace-to-plant protocol to evaluate how impervious surfaces around trees in urban environments may be associated with scale insect abundance. This module highlights ecological concepts, such as population dynamics, species interactions, competition, and food webs, among others. Through this module, students also learn skills in ecological field sampling techniques, particularly how to randomly sample, how to estimate insect abundance, and how to use observation skills to inform scientific inquiry.

AB  - Changes in Southern Ocean thermohaline conditions could drive changes in phytoplankton community composition propagating into upper-trophic levels, from the abundance and composition of mid-trophic level communities to foraging behaviour of top marine predators. Studies exploring the ecological consequences of such processes are largely limited by our in-situ observation capacity. The simultaneous deployment of a miniature sonar tag, combining active acoustics and movement sensors, with oceanographic tags on 4 adult female southern elephant seals from the Kerguelen Islands provided in-situ measurements of thermohaline conditions, mid-trophic level abundance and seal-foraging behaviour. In addition, chlorophyll-a concentration and relative abundance of different phytoplankton size classes were assessed from satellite ocean colour data. This study reveals that east of the Kerguelen Islands, the subsurface scatterer abundance (related to mid-trophic level organisms) assessed by the sonar tag was partly positively linked to surface satellite-derived microphytoplankton biomass, especially in colder waters and frontal zones. Female elephant seals were found to dive shallower with higher subsurface scatterer abundance, which indicated a better prey accessibility, and were found to catch more prey when foraging in shallow and/or frontal zones. This study highlights the usefulness of the sonar tag, deployed on deep-diving elephant seals, to link thermohaline conditions and phytoplankton community composition in mid-trophic levels. Our result suggests that in addition to phytoplankton biomass, mid-trophic level abundance and distribution might be key factors in influencing top-marine predator foraging performances.

AB  - When encountering an insect species that targets high-value plants, such as acacia in large-scale tree programs like the Great Green Wall (GGW), it is essential to assess the phytosanitary risks associated with this species. When it has not previously been described locally, accurate taxonomic identification is a crucial pre-requisite. The DNA-barcoding approach is relevant for delineating and assigning unidentified specimens to species or molecular operational taxonomic units already listed in reference DNA databases. From 2020 to 2023, in the Ferlo region of Senegal, where GGW's reforestation activities were implemented, a defoliator caterpillar species not previously reported in the region was observed causing damage to three indigenous acacia species (Vachellia tortilis raddiana, V. nilotica, Senegalia senegal). The barcoding approach coupled with external and/or internal morphological observations of the various stages collected enabled us to assign the specimens to Isturgia pulinda deerraria (Geometridae) but confronted us with the ongoing nomenclatural problem associated with this taxon. Interestingly, based on 122 mitochondrial barcode sequences (78 from our study, 44 retrieved from genetic databases), high intraspecific genetic diversity was revealed both in Senegal and worldwide, with two weakly divergent geographical lineages, an African-Eastern lineage and a Mediterranean lineage. The observation of the species from 2020 to 2023, both at the end of the rainy season and during the dry season on nurseries or plantations of acacia (Fabaceae) in the 5 localities studied and incidentally on Moringa oleifera (Moringaceae) suggests that, even at low numbers, it could pose an additional biotic threat to woody vegetation-based programs.

AB  - The decomposition of carrion is crucial to the functioning and nutrient cycling of ecosystems, and many species use this high-quality resource. However, the availability and reliability of carrion differs across environments. Modified landscapes, such as farms and roads, often produce a high density of carcasses, with disproportionate benefits for generalist mesoscavengers that can tolerate, or are attracted to, human presence. In this study, we placed carcasses strategically across two large islands in southern Australia and used camera traps to investigate how different scavengers locate and use carrion in forested, farmland and roadside habitats. Forest ravens, an avian generalist, were the dominant scavengers across all three habitat types but were three times more likely to discover carcasses deployed in modified landscapes. Raptors were twice as likely to discover and use carcasses in farmland habitats, indicating enhanced scavenging opportunities in these areas. The discovery rate and use of carcasses by feral cats did not differ between habitat types. In this setting, differences in carrion use between diurnal and nocturnal scavengers are potentially due to the absence of top mammalian carnivores (Tasmanian devils and quolls). Diurnal scavengers, such as forest ravens and raptors, followed expected habitat preferences, albeit with greater access to carrion due to increased persistence. However, feral cats demonstrated no preference for carcasses across habitats, likely due to the reduced landscape of fear. Overall, our study underscores the important role of native mammalian carnivores in structuring scavenger communities and further validates the value of trophic rewilding to restore key ecological functions.

AB  - Hybridization between native and introduced species is one of the most important reasons underlying the impact on biodiversity exerted by biological invasions and also one of the hardest to be detected. The East-Asian sika deer Cervus nippon has been introduced to several European countries, where it is known to generate fertile offspring with the congeneric native red deer C. elaphus, threatening its local populations with genetic pollution. Most studies on hybrid populations have been carried out in northern and eastern Europe, whereas introductions of this deer and their effects are still poorly known in Southern countries. In this study, we updated the distribution of sika deer in Italy, where the species has been present since at least 25 years ago, but where no formal assessment has ever been conducted. We confirm the occurrence of sika deer genes in formerly pure red-deer populations in central Italy by means of genetic analyses. Further range expansion of invasive sika deer and red x sika deer hybrids is likely to lead to further hybridisations and introgression, with implications for the genetic integrity of native red deer populations.

AB  - Herbivorous fishes are the major consumers of macroalgae on coral reefs. Macroalgae are then degraded by fish gut microbiota. Despite the importance of this process, there remains a lack of information about the gut bacterial community of herbivorous fishes in coral reefs. This study examined the composition and potential metabolic functions of gut microbiota through full-length 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing for coral reef fish species from the Xisha islands of China, including five herbivorous species (Naso unicornis, N. lituratus, N. brevirostris, Ctenochaetus striatus, and Siganus argenteus) and one carnivorous species (Myripristis kuntee). The composition of the gut bacterial community and potential functional genes were observed and significant differences were identified between herbivorous and carnivorous fish species. The bacterial diversity (Shannon and Simpson indexes) in herbivorous fish was significantly higher than in carnivorous fish. Clostridium was significantly more abundant in carnivorous fish than herbivorous fish (p < 0.05). Conversely, Niameybacter, Alistipes, Desulfovibrio, and Akkermansia were more abundant in herbivorous fish (p < 0.05). These bacterial genera, which are shared among herbivorous fish, are believed to play crucial roles in macroalgae metabolism. A principal coordinate analysis further revealed that the gut bacterial composition of the five herbivorous fish species could be divided into two distinct clusters, which was influenced by selective feeding behaviors on different macro-algae types. Functional analysis of gut bacteria in herbivorous fishes showed a high abundance of carbohydrate metabolism pathways. Through comparison with the carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZy) database, eight glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and one glycosyltransferase (GT) were identified in herbivorous fishes, providing further insights into the roles of gut microbiota in macroalgae metabolism. This study provides valuable insights into the roles of the gut microbiota in herbivorous fishes with regard to metabolizing various types of macroalgae.

AB  - The tule elk (Cervus canadensis nannodes) is a California endemic subspecies that experienced an extreme bottleneck (potentially two individuals) in the mid-1800s. Through active management, including reintroductions, the subspecies has grown to approximately 6000 individuals spread across 22 recognized populations. The populations tend to be localized and separated by unoccupied intervening habitat, prompting targeted translocations to ensure gene flow. However, little is known about the genetic status or connectivity among adjacent populations in the absence of active translocations. We used 19 microsatellites and a sex marker to obtain baseline data on the genetic effective population sizes and functional genetic connectivity of four of these populations, three of which were established since the 1980s and one of which was established similar to 100 years ago. A Bayesian assignment approach suggested the presence of 5 discrete genetic clusters, which corresponded to the four primary populations and two subpopulations within the oldest of them. Effective population sizes ranged from 15 (95% CI 10-22) to 51 (95% CI 32-88). We detected little or no evidence of gene flow among most populations. Exceptions were a signature of unidirectional gene flow to one population founded by emigrants of the other 30 years earlier, and bidirectional gene flow between subpopulations within the oldest population. We propose that social cohesion more than landscape characteristics explained population structure, which developed over many generations corresponding to population expansion. Whether or which populations can grow and reach sufficient effective population sizes on their own or require translocations to maintain genetic diversity and population growth is unclear. In the future, we recommend pairing genetic with demographic monitoring of these and other reintroduced elk populations, including targeted monitoring following translocations to evaluate their effects and necessity.

AB  - Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) and mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are important vectors of pathogens affecting ruminants. On deer farms, Culicoides species transmit bluetongue virus and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus, while mosquitoes can cause chronic stress and even exsanguination. We evaluated the effectiveness of the insecticide InsectGuard (0.5% permethrin), applied as a barrier treatment and pour-on, to reduce mosquito and biting midge landings on deer in Martin County, Florida. Deer simulators baited with carbon dioxide and fitted with sticky cards were used to trap landing insects. A polyethylene fence barrier treated with InsectGuard (1.34 fl oz/m(2)) and an untreated fence were tested against a no-barrier control. Separately, InsectGuard pour-on (1 fl oz per deer) was compared to an untreated control. The InsectGuard-treated barrier and pour-on applications reduced landings of three Culicoides species, including Culicoides insignis Lutz, a key bluetongue virus vector, by 175-fold and 7-fold, respectively. The InsectGuard-treated barrier also reduced mosquito landings: Culex spp. (15-fold), and Psorophora spp. (6-fold). While the InsectGuard pour-on caused a dramatic reduction of C. insignis, it had no measurable effect on Culex spp., Psorophora spp., or Culicoides floridensis Beck and appeared to attract Culicoides pusillus Lutz (8-fold increase). Our findings demonstrate that permethrin-treated barriers and pour-on applications can reduce the landing and, therefore, potential infectious bites of mosquitoes and biting midges. These interventions can be incorporated as part of an integrated vector management program for deer farms to enhance control outcomes, in combination with other strategies such as adulticide sprays, habitat management, and vaccination.

AB  - The larger kangaroos (Macropus giganteus, M. fuliginosus and Osphranter rufus) are widely distributed and have a national population which fluctuates in response to changes in grass growth and trends to 40 million. Most are outside parks and reserves and, on pastoral properties, particularly on the rangelands of southern Australia. High numbers compromise regenerative agriculture, pasture conservation, revegetation and stewardship programmes, and can have significant financial impacts on landholders by lowering livestock production and damaging sustainability. Some smaller macropods, wallabies and pademelons, also have a similar effect, especially in Tasmania and on other smaller Australian Islands where foxes are absent. Paradoxically, kangaroos have a wide range of potentially valuable production attributes and are unique, which should be a global comparative advantage. The kangaroo industry is established with a small domestic and international market, although demand has been falling in recent years. Non-commercial culling is rising, which results in millions of carcasses being wasted and left to decompose in the field. Indigenous communities abhor such waste and its cultural implications. A stronger kangaroo industry would be a better solution to managing overabundant kangaroos than pest culling and exclusion fences. Because kangaroos move from property to property, populations need to be managed on a regional basis through 'regional property-based kangaroo production'. A form of proprietorship over this mobile resource would encourage landholders to play a role in creating greater demand for kangaroo products. They would have an incentive to raise the value of kangaroos. Through innovative harvesting, they could deliver high-quality, environmentally branded, accurately described, gourmet, differentiated products integrated with other livestock industries. They could establish cooperatives and embark on promoting regional kangaroo products. Policy improvements are needed to achieve these production systems. Doing so would diversify their enterprises, convert a liability already on their properties into an asset, create employment, enhance rural economic resilience, and improve animal welfare and conservation outcomes while earning them carbon credits. These opportunities become even more profound as climate change progresses.

AB  - Crambe sventenii Pett. ex Bramwell & Sunding and Pleudia herbanica (A.Santos & M.Fern & aacute;ndez) M.Will, N.Schmalz & Class.-Bockh. are two single-island endemic species from Fuerteventura (Canary Islands), inhabiting the same areas and similar habitats. They are under the "Critically Endangered" category due to historical herbivore pressure, mainly goats, leading to habitat fragmentation and poor population recruitment. The main aim of our study was to provide insights into the conservation genetics and habitat suitability of these two species. For this purpose, we sampled all known populations on the island and developed two new sets of microsatellite markers. Moreover, to assist restoration plans, we performed species distribution models to determine the most suitable areas for reintroduction. While Crambe sventenii is highly fragmented, with low genetic diversity indices in some populations, Pleudia herbanica's genetic structure is quite homogeneous, grouped in three main regions, with signs of inbreeding and an overall low genetic diversity. Both species could present moderate to high levels of autogamy. Our findings can provide guidance to local governments regarding conservation actions to be implemented in the field, like the identification of propagule sources and new suitable areas for restoration.

AB  - The oxygen isotope ratio of carbonate in Tridacna shell (delta O-18(shell)) is assumed to be precipitated in isotopic equilibrium with surrounding seawater and thus reflects a combination of the Sea surface temperature (SST) and the delta O-18 of seawater (delta O-18(SW)). Accordingly, Tridacna delta O-18(shell) has been widely used for high-resolution paleoclimate reconstructions. However, the influences of interspecific differences, spatial heterogeneity, as well as the "growth effect" on the delta O-18(shell)-SST relationship, have not been fully tested. Here, we present a monthly resolved delta O-18(shell) record of a Tridacna squamosa specimen from Yagong Island, South China sea (SCS). Our results suggested that the monthly resolved delta O-18(shell) from northern SCS was dominated by the seasonal SST variations, which was highly correlated with measured SST after excluding the influence of delta O-18(SW). Then, the SST = f(delta O-18(shell)-delta O-18(SW)) equations of all published monthly delta O-18(shell) records of modern Tridacna from the Indo-Pacific were collected. The resulting investigation revealed that similar SST = f(delta O-18(shell)-delta O-18(SW)) equations for each shell, indicating the minor influences of spatial heterogeneity and interspecific differences. The average equation for Tridacna (Tridacna gigas, Tridacna derasa, Tridacna squamosa, Tridacna maxima and Hippopus hippopus) was SST = - 3.56 +/- 1.26 (delta O-18(shell)-delta O-18(sw)) + 22.44 +/- 2.77 (- 0.28 +/- 0.08 parts per thousand degrees C-1, VPDB) (2 sigma), which was close to the equations set up for other mollusks (without Tridacna) and inorganic aragonite. Finally, although the growth rates varied greatly among Tridacna specimens and within different growth stages of each specimen, we did not find a significant influence of the growth rates on SST = f(delta O-18-(shell) - delta O-18(SW)) equations, indicating that the "growth effect" might have at best a slight impact on the delta O-18(shell) of Tridacna.

AB  - In the absence of verification, historical aspects of wildlife management or conservation sometimes have become established in the literature and persisted therein for decades; in other situations, serendipitous discoveries have corrected information that earlier had been treated as factual. In some cases, efforts to vet historical accounts have been ongoing for many years; such is the case involving William Franklin Frakes, an American rancher, naturalist, adventurer, and author, who captured and translocated bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in California, USA, near the turn of the twentieth century. In this review, we provide information that substantiates the majority of Frakes's activities, including newfound evidence that he attempted to capture bighorn sheep in heretofore undisclosed locations. We relied on his articles that appeared in turn-of-the-century sporting magazines, his extensive correspondence with respected individuals and organizations active in wildlife conservation at that time, information published in the scientific and popular literature, interviews with local historians or authorities, and our personal knowledge of the geographic areas traversed by Frakes. We provide strong evidence that he captured bighorn sheep in the Avawatz Mountains and substantial support for the notion that he released at least some of those animals, and possibly hybrids between them and domestic sheep, near the west end of the Bullion Mountains, a location that heretofore has escaped critical scrutiny. We further discuss the implications of his activities in the context of the potential for disease transmission, the subsequent dynamics of bighorn sheep inhabiting the Bullion Mountains and surrounding ranges, metapopulation function, and the possibility that the genetic structure of bighorn sheep occupying that range was altered by Frakes's actions. All of these have implications for understanding the historical influence of anthropogenic activities on bighorn sheep >100 years ago. We also include an appendix comprising information discovered during our research, but that we have been unable to substantiate or that otherwise is of interest.

AB  - This study presents the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios from the tooth enamel of 57 sheep and goat specimens, in order to explore animal mobility in the Middle and Late Bronze Age society of the Balearic Islands (Naviform period). Seven archaeological sites from Mallorca and Menorca located in different biotopes and with different functionalities were selected. The results provide some of the first data on the geographic range of meat provisioning at each site. In addition, several present-day leaves, as well as tooth dentine and bones were analysed to assess local strontium isotopic ratios in different geological layers existing in the Balearic Islands. The results suggest that most caprines were sourced from the neighbouring areas of each site, but also suggest a correlation between strontium isotope variability and site function: domestic settlements and sites related with maritime exchanges had significantly more variability compared to fortified sites. In addition, the ritual cave of Cova del Camp del Bisbe had the highest diversity of strontium isotopic ratios, thus suggesting that caprines were brought here from a variety of different locations.

AB  - Tree hollows are important structural habitat features for secondary cavity-nesting birds, however, there has been limited research on how fire severity and frequency affect hollow abundance. Following a mega-fire on Kangaroo Island during the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season, we conducted an opportunistic post-fire assessment of the fate of 144 monitored hollows in Eucalyptus cladocalyx and Eucalyptus leucoxylon trees used by endangered glossy black-cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus lathami halmaturinus) and yellow-tailed black-cockatoos (Zanda funerea). We investigated the relationship between burn severity, inter-fire interval, tree species and landscape position on the likelihood of tree hollow loss. We also compared the occupancy of nest boxes by both cockatoo species in fire-affected catchments pre-fire (2015-2017; 59 nest boxes) and post-fire (2020-2022; 52 nest boxes). Surveys revealed that 64.4% of monitored tree hollows within the burnt area were destroyed, as were the trees that contained them. Most monitored tree hollows (76.9%) were in areas that had not experienced fire in >50 years prior to the 2019-2020 fires. Tree hollow loss in 2020 was 29 times greater than the mean annual loss of 1.6% recorded in the 22 years prior. Burn severity, inter-fire interval, landscape matrix and tree species were poor predictors of hollow loss. However, increasing distance from forest edge slightly increased the probability of hollow loss. Post-fire, the proportion of nest boxes used for nesting by glossy black-cockatoos per annum increased to 0.70 +/- 0.09, compared to 0.50 +/- 0.03 pre-fire. However, the proportion of nest boxes used for nesting by yellow-tailed black-cockatoos per annum remained similar (post-fire 0.32 +/- 0.12; pre-fire 0.28 +/- 0.05). The mega-fires on Kangaroo Island in 2019-2020 resulted in tree hollow loss on a much larger scale than recorded in the 22 years prior, and subsequently, nest boxes have become an important resource for the endangered glossy black-cockatoo.

AB  - Information on the distribution and abundance of marine birds is needed to evaluate current status in relation to threats from potential increases in vessel traffic off southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia (BC), Canada, in the Salish Sea. We conducted year-round boatbased surveys in waters between Sidney, BC and Victoria, BC from November 2015 to August 2019 and examined seasonal variation in bird distribution and abundance. Our study area included parts of the Sidney Channel Important Bird Area, the Shoal Harbour and Victoria Harbour Migratory Bird Sanctuaries, and the Chain Islets Ecological Reserve, adjacent to major shipping lanes, as well as ports and marinas. With the approval for the proposed expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline to Burnaby, BC, tanker traffic is expected to increase in our study area. Increases in several categories of marine vessel traffic have occurred recently in the Salish Sea and are expected to increase further with the development of Liquefied Natural Gas projects and the Delta Port expansion on Roberts Bank. Within that context, we counted all marine birds but focused primarily on alcids: Rhinoceros Auklet Cerorhinca monocerata, Common Murre Uria aalge, Pigeon Guillemot Cepphus columba, Marbled Murrelet Brachyramphus marmoratus, and Ancient Murrelet Synthliboramphus antiquus. Alcids were present year-round but showed species-specific seasonal spatial patterns. These patterns are likely related to seabird annual cycles as well as fluctuations in forage fish prey populations, their habitats, and variation in seasonal availability to birds. Increasingly busy shipping lanes for tanker, cargo, and passenger vessels pass nearby and through our study area. These shipping lanes, together with traffic from tugs, fishing vessels, and recreational motor and sailing vessels, plus the many marinas and terminals in the area, pose significant risks to marine birds.

AB  - Effective management of rare species requires an understanding of spatial variation in abundance, which is challenging to estimate. We tested the efficacy of high-resolution imagery to detect burrows of the Texas kangaroo rat (TKR; Dipodomys elator) as a means of estimating abundance across its geographic range. Specifically, we estimated burrow counts using an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) to collect data from very high-resolution Red-Green-Blue (RGB) imagery and estimate digital elevation (2.5-mm pixel resolution) over active and inactive burrows located on mesquite mounds and anthropogenic features (roadsides, fences, etc.). In 2018, we identified 26 burrow locations on a private ranch in Wichita County, Texas, USA, and characterized burrows based on topography and vegetation density. We found that TKR burrows can only be identified with data of <5 cm pixel resolution, thus eliminating the possibility of using high-resolution imagery data currently available for Texas. Alternatively, we propose that the use of National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery at 0.5- and 0.6-m pixel resolution, in combination with resampled digital elevation data, can provide an effective means for identifying potential TKR burrow locations at the county level. We present 3 different approaches at the county and local scale that combine topographic and vegetation fractional cover information using a weighted overlay approach. The modeling approaches have strong predictive capabilities and can be integrated with UAS data for visual confirmation of active and inactive burrows. We concluded that very high-resolution imagery and topographic information at pixel resolutions <5 cm collected by airborne systems can effectively help locate active TKR burrows. However, to remain cost effective, upscaling to the county level will require reducing the sampling area to the most suitable habitat. Modeling approaches, such as those proposed in this study, can help effectively locate these sampling areas.

AB  - Simple Summary As a product originating from the most natural living conditions with free foraging, red deer (Cervus elaphus) meat is becoming increasingly popular among consumers. A greater supply of this type of meat can be ensured by dynamically developing red deer farming on permanent grasslands. The study presents a comparison of the properties of lipids and the content of cadmium and lead in the LL and SM muscles of red deer kept in forest, organic farm, and conventional farm feeding grounds. The greater species and phytoncide diversity in the organic feeding ground enriched the quantitative profile and significantly increased the content of beneficial polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) (CLA-conjugated linoleic acid, ALA-alpha-linolenic acid, AA-arachidonic acid, and EPA-eicosapentaenoic acid) and the sum of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), n-6 PUFA, and n-3 PUFA, in comparison with conventional farm and forest feeding grounds. It also contributed to a significantly lower n-6/n-3 ratio in both muscles. The study provides valuable data on the nutritional value and ecological safety of venison, which should be regarded as a health-enhancing food product. Furthermore, the present results can help breeders to make decisions about the locations of farms and the choice of red deer nutrition strategies. The aim of the study was to compare the properties of lipids and the content of cadmium and lead in the meat of red deer (Cervus elaphus) kept in a forest feeding ground (FFG) and on organic and conventional farms in Poland. Longissimus lumborum (LL) and Musculus semimembranosus (SM) muscles were collected for the study from 36 red deer carcasses in an equal sex and age ratio (3 and 4 years old). From April to October, the animals consumed only the vegetation growing in the feeding grounds. The floristic and phytoncide composition, as well as the fodder value, of the feeding grounds were assessed. Additionally, the intramuscular fat and cholesterol content, the profile, sum, and ratios of fatty acids (FAs), lipid nutraceutical parameters, and cadmium and lead content were determined in LL and SM. The plant composition comprised 116 species in the organic feeding ground (OFG) and 78 species in the conventional feeding ground (CFG). The LL and SM muscles of the red deer from the organic and forest feeding grounds exhibited significantly lower amounts of fat and cholesterol than those from the conventional system. The differences in the fatty acid composition between the three groups were quite small. Differences in intramuscular fat content contributed to a higher percentage of PUFAs in the FFG and OFG, in comparison to the CFG. In all types of feeding ground, the cadmium (0.002 to 0.008 mg/kg) and lead (0.009 to 0.019 mg/kg) content determined in the meat did not pose a threat to consumers.

AB  - Quantitative food web analyses can provide insights into the specificity of consumers such as herbivores, parasites and parasitoids. Understanding such patterns can be useful in forecasting the potential benefits and risks of biological control agents being considered for introduction against invasive species. The avian vampire fly, Philornis downsi (Diptera: Muscidae), is a neotropical bird parasite that is invasive in the Galapagos Islands, where it is causing substantial mortality of endemic bird species. We used a novel in-field experimental food web approach within the native range of P. downsi in Ecuador to test the hypotheses that pupal parasitoids known to attack P. downsi specialize on members of the genus Philornis, which occur only in bird nests. We deployed pupae of non-Philornis fly species adjacent to bird nests to assess specificity of the parasitoids and used two indices to assess specificity: Resource Range (RR), which evaluates the breadth of host use, and Pair Difference Index (PDI), which evaluates interaction strength. The results revealed very strong compartmentalization within the guild of pupal fly parasitoids, with four species attacking only Philornis spp. Both specificity indices indicated significant levels of specificity towards the genus Philornis for two of these species: Conura annulifera and Trichopria sp. novus. We also assessed the specificity of the two dominant Philornis species attacking 11 bird species and preference of the two dominant parasitoid species for bird species. Although there was some significant preference for particular bird species by the Philornis spp., there was no indication that this drove specificity patterns by the parasitoids. Policy implications. Our results confirm previous laboratory studies indicating specificity by C. annulifera and support the hypothesis that this species would produce few, if any, nontarget impacts if released into Galapagos to suppress populations of the P. downsi. These results can inform an environmental risk assessment framework to guide governmental agencies in deliberation on potential field releases of parasitoids in the Galapagos Islands.

AB  - Corporate carbon emissions reporting is central to climate accountability, yet significant gaps remain in transparency, completeness, and methodological rigor. This study introduces the Carbon Integrity Index (CIX), a structured framework for assessing disclosure quality through ten indicators covering Scopes 1, 2, and 3. Unlike existing standards focused on reporting requirements, the CIX evaluates how well emissions are reported, addressing methodological transparency, scope coverage, and treatment of uncertainty. Applied to 2022 sustainability reports from companies listed in Spain's IBEX 35 index, the framework reveals an average score of 5.7/10, with 69% of firms achieving passing results. While Scope 2 reporting was generally robust (mean: 0.82), Scope 3 disclosures-often representing the majority of emissions-and uncertainty assessments were systematically weak (mean: 0.08). Findings provide empirical support for legitimacy and institutional theory, showing how formal compliance can mask performative compliance that limits meaningful accountability. Sectoral differences suggest that institutional pressures and operational complexity shape divergent transparency pathways, raising concerns that universal standards may entrench reporting disparities. The CIX offers regulators, investors, and companies a practical tool for distinguishing symbolic from substantive disclosure, enabling more informed decision-making and strengthening the role of reporting in driving the transition to net-zero business models.

AB  - Formerly common in tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean, the Critically Endangered smalltooth sawfish, Pristis pectinata, underwent severe declines over the past century, restricting population(s) to south and south-west Florida in the US, and Bahamian waters. Anecdotal evidence (e.g. encounter reports from the public) suggests that P. pectinata have recently been observed in historically occupied US waters; however, no directed surveys have been conducted to verify their extent of occupancy. Here, environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys were used to investigate the occurrence of P. pectinata in three formerly occupied estuaries in US waters. Water samples were collected in the summer from the Indian River Lagoon and Tampa Bay, Florida, in 2018 and 2019, and from Mississippi Sound, Mississippi, in 2018, and screened for target DNA using a highly sensitive Droplet Digital (TM) polymerase chain reaction assay. Target DNA was detected at four sites in the Indian River Lagoon in 2018 and at one site in 2019 (average concentration: 0.086 copies mu l(-1); SE = 0.004), but was not detected in either year in Tampa Bay. Target DNA was also detected at three sites near Deer Island in Mississippi Sound in 2018 (average concentration: 0.090 copies mu l(-1); SE = 0.005). These surveys provide additional lines of evidence that P. pectinata is re-occurring within two historically occupied estuaries in US waters. More comprehensive eDNA surveys in historically occupied regions, combined with clearly defined post-survey management actions, can direct additional research and outreach initiatives in emerging priority areas, fostering recovery of this Critically Endangered species.

AB  - Understanding the impacts of global change on ecological communities is a major challenge in modern ecology. The gain or loss of particular species and the disruption of key interactions are both consequences and drivers of global change that can lead to the disassembly of ecological networks. We examined whether the disruption of a hummingbird-mistletoe-marsupial mutualism by the invasion of non-native species can have cascading effects on both pollination and seed dispersal networks in the temperate forest of Patagonia, Argentina. We focused on network motifs, subnetworks composed of a small number of species exhibiting particular patterns of interaction, to examine the structure and diversity of mutualistic networks. We found that the hummingbird-mistletoe-marsupial mutualism plays a critical role in the community by increasing the complexity of pollination and seed dispersal networks through supporting a high diversity of interactions. Moreover, we found that the disruption of this tripartite mutualism by non-native ungulates resulted in diverse indirect effects that led to less complex pollination and seed dispersal networks. Our results demonstrate that the gains and losses of particular species and the alteration of key interactions can lead to cascading effects in the community through the disassembly of mutualistic networks.

AB  - DNA metabarcoding analysis for gut contents has been shown to compensate the disadvantage of traditionally morphological identification and offer higher resolution of prey items in an efficient way. Holland's carp (Spinibarbus hollandi) is a freshwater fish native to southern and eastern Taiwan. In the past two decades, this species has been introduced as a sport fish into the river basins of northern and western Taiwan. The large body size and active predation make it a potential threat for native fishes, but which native species are preyed by Holland's carp remains unknown. In this study, the diet from the gut contents of Holland's carp from the Zhonggang River, an invaded basin, was examined using DNA metabarcoding from 51 individuals and by morphological examinations on 140 samples. Detritus of plants were found in 83.6% samples (117 individuals). Twenty fish species of seven families were identified by DNA metabarcoding, including species of all water layers. Taiwan torrent carp (Acrossocheilus paradoxus) and Rhinogobius spp. are the most common prey items. Based on the results of this study, Holland's carp is considered an opportunistic omnivore because of its diverse diet items, which is an important trait for successful invasive fish species. The population decline of Opsariichthys pachycephalus may not result from the invasion of Holland's carps. Nonetheless, the time lag between successful invasion and the samplings of this study may be a concern because the population size of O. pachycephalus may have declined and become difficult to prey. The Holland's carps consumed the least species in winter; nonetheless, the occurrence frequencies of preys among seasons were not significantly different probably because of limited temperature fluctuation. The smallest Holland's carps consumed the least prey species compared to other size categories, similar to the relationship of prey species number to size of invasive largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides).

AB  - African savannah elephants (Loxodonta africana) can have detrimental impacts on trees; studies exploring elephant impact within small, fenced reserves, have lacked focus in determining elephant high-use areas, the direct effect of fence line and tree recovery. The aim of this study is to assess whether elephants cause significant impact on trees in the small-fenced Karongwe Private Game Reserve (KPGR) and to determine the levels of tree recovery. Trees >= 5 m in height were surveyed (n = 634 trees). Elephant location data were used to identify high- and low-use areas. Five species accounted for 80% of the records; these were used for further analysis. Trees in high-use areas were significantly less likely to show signs of debarking and push over. Tall trees were significantly more likely to be impacted by elephants, being associated with heightened risks of debarking and branches being broken but lower risks of being pushed over. Trees close to the fence line were not more impacted than trees near the centre of the reserve. The level of use, distance to the fence and tree height were not significant predictors of tree recovery indicators. Future mitigation efforts should focus on trees with high levels of impact and low levels of recovery.

AB  - Marine oil spills have become a significant threat to ocean environments and ecosystems. The development of effective marine oil spill identification technology is crucial for emergency authorities to enhance response strategies. In this letter, a marine oil spill detection method based on the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features, random forest classifier, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was proposed. First, row vector convolution and mean filtering were adopted to extract and smooth the co-frequency interferences. Then, binarization processing and median filtering were used to eliminate speckles. After that, gray correction and contrast enhancement model were performed to enhance the overall oil slick features. Next, HOG features and random forest classifier were utilized to extract effective oil spill regions. Finally, the PSO algorithm was introduced to iteratively optimize the adaptive dual-threshold for segmenting the real oil slicks. This approach enables accurate and efficient detection of oil spills, offering a scientific foundation for responding to offshore oil spill incidents.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal encephalopathy affecting North American cervids. Certain alleles in a host's prion protein gene are responsible for reduced susceptibility to CWD. We assessed for the first time variability in the prion protein gene of elk (Cervus canadensis) present in Pennsylvania, United States of America, a reintroduced population for which CWD cases have never been reported. We sequenced the prion protein gene (PRNP) of 565 elk samples collected over 7 years (2014-2020) and found two polymorphic sites (codon 21 and codon 132). The allele associated with reduced susceptibility to CWD is present in the population, and there was no evidence of deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in any of our sampling years (p-values between 0.14 and 1), consistent with the lack of selective pressure on the PRNP. The less susceptible genotypes were found in a frequency similar to the ones reported for elk populations in the states of Wyoming and South Dakota before CWD was detected. We calculated the proportion of less susceptible genotypes in each hunt zone in Pennsylvania as a proxy for their vulnerability to the establishment of CWD, and interpolated these results to obtain a surface representing expected proportion of the less susceptible genotypes across the area. Based on this analysis, hunt zones located in the southern part of our study area have a low proportion of less susceptible genotypes, which is discouraging for elk persistence in Pennsylvania given that these hunt zones are adjacent to the deer Disease Management Area 3, where CWD has been present since 2014.

AB  - Thousands of captive white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) facilities exist across North America for the purpose of producing trophy-quality deer (i.e., exceptionally large-antlered). Many of these deer get marketed to private landowners with the expectation that introduced deer will enhance genetics in the population, resulting in larger-antlered male deer. Previous research suggests that white-tailed deer experience highly variable survival and reproductive success post-translocation, however, little is known about the fate of translocated white-tailed deer sourced from captive-breeding operations. We translocated 24 adult female deer over a 3-year period into a private, 300-ha high-fence enclosure in east-central Alabama. We monitored survival, reproductive success, and fawn recruitment of the translocated deer using VHF radio collars and vaginal implant transmitters (VITs). We found that survival rates were greater than studies where deer were translocated from the wild, but fawn survival and recruitment was poor. We believe our findings provide a baseline of expectations for captive deer translocations. Our following research objectives focus on improving camera survey output for white-tailed deer by reducing sex-age misclassifications. Previous research suggests that misclassifications may be an important source of error in wildlife camera surveys. We developed and tested the effects of species-specific training material designed to reduce sex-age misclassification associated with white-tailed deer images. We found exposure to training material produced the greatest significant improvement on classification accuracy of deer images compared to any other respondent-based factors we investigated. We also found that other experiential factors were positively associated with classification accuracy of deer images. Our findings suggest that use of species-specific training material can reduce misclassifications, leading to more reliable data.

AB  - Over the past 70 years, the introduced, invasive hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand) has become established and caused considerable decline and mortality of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.) across much of the tree's natural range. Hemlock is a foundation tree species with little inherent resistance to this exotic species and infestation by this sap-feeding insect results in progressive crown decline and tree mortality within 4 to 15 years. Continued climate warming favours the spread of this insect to Ontario and other areas at the northern edge of hemlock's range. More than 30 years of basic and applied research directed towards control and mitigation of damage by this insect indicates that the rate of development of hemlock decline and mortality depends on climate, site, and stand factors that affect both insect performance and hemlock vigour. Here we synthesize these research findings to provide science-based management recommendations to (1) increase the resilience of Ontario's hemlock forest resource to this insect before it spreads, (2) mitigate hemlock woolly adelgid damage once it gets established, and (3) facilitate degraded hemlock forest restoration.

AB  - Little is known about the effects of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on tropical insect communities, even though they are suffering rapid declines in complexity and stability due to climate change. We explore the impact of fluctuations in local climate imposed by ENSO on the performance of herbivore defences mediating enemy interactions. In a widespread rainforest edge community, we quantified the mortality caused by five enemy guilds on the immature stages of the herbivorous beetle, Acromis sparsa. ENSO was a significant determinant of beetle mortality. During warmer, drier El Nino years, the survival of beetles decreased. This was due to increased egg parasitism by wasps, which reduced hatching. Additionally, ant predation on beetle larvae increased. Flies and wasps were in competition for larval prey in wetter, cooler La Nina years. Experimental removal of maternal guards or chemical shields revealed which ENSO-related parameters predicted larval mortality. Guarding was most effective against social wasps in La Nina, whereas shields proved most effective in El Nino. Two ENSO-related defence-enemy breakdowns occurred: (1) decoupling whereby the efficacy of a narrow defensive adaptation was reduced to increase mortality, and (2) mismatching whereby the resistance of a narrow defensive adaptation against non-targeted enemies was further reduced to increase mortality. These results highlight that defence efficacy against natural enemies can vary predictably with biotic and abiotic environmental conditions. ENSO events will increase breakdowns in defence-mediated interactions, shifts in competition among enemies, and species loss.

AB  - Many critically endangered species persist in remnant populations so small that ecological information required to assist recovery, such as species-typical demographic parameters and habitat preferences, can be difficult to acquire based on science alone. Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) or local ecological knowledge (LEK) can fill information gaps and provide additional understanding, though this expertise is not everlasting and often overlooked. We report on research focused on a species survival plan for mountain bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus isaaci), a critically endangered antelope endemic to Kenya, persisting in the wild with fewer than 80 individuals in four separated montane forests. In preparation for a potential conservation translocation of captive-bred bongos into one or more forests, extensive camera trapping yielded limited results, suggesting that data were based on the activities of just a few individuals. Moreover, additional information critical to translocations, such as typical group size and sex ratios, could neither be observed nor obtained from the literature. This knowledge gap was largely resolved using expert interviews conducted with eight former Kenyan hunters, along with historical range and browse mapping, enriching understanding of behavioral characteristics rendering bongo particularly vulnerable to exploitation. Consistently similar responses from observations spanning a 50-year period (1950s to 1990s) across four ecosystems added certainty to responses. This study endorses a combination of data sources when dealing with remnant populations, and specifically recommends making use of this documented mountain bongo TEK/LEK to inform decisions about potential bongo reintroductions in Kenya.

AB  - Continuous movement monitoring is a powerful tool for evaluating reintroduction techniques and assessing how well reintroduced animals are adjusting to the wild. However, to date, continuous monitoring has only occurred for large-bodied species capable of carrying heavy tracking devices. In this study we used an automated VHF radio telemetry array to investigate the exploratory behavior and movement patterns of critically endangered ?Alal? (Corvus hawaiiensis), reintroduced to the Island of Hawai?i in 2017. The 11 juvenile ?Alal? we tracked exhibited high site fidelity and initial survival. Over time the birds showed decreased time spent at the supplemental feeders, and transitioned to more focused use of the landscape, suggesting increased foraging on wild food items. Birds with seemingly less spatial neophobia at release also made larger post-release exploratory movements. This study provides the first evidence that 1) supplemental feeding can support site fidelity for reintroduced ?Alal? without restricting a transition to independent foraging, and 2) that pre-release personality metrics may be useful predictors for predicting post-release movements of ?Alal?. Our work is the first to demonstrate the utility and power of automated telemetry for monitoring the reintroduction of small species.

AB  - Coral reefs are in global decline primarily due to climate change. Herbivory is often viewed as key to maintaining coral-dominated reefs, and herbivore management is gaining traction as a possible strategy for promoting reef resilience. The functional impact of herbivorous fishes has typically been inferred from total biomass, but robust estimates of ecological processes are needed to better inform management targets. Here, we provide a framework to calculate rates of herbivory across Pacific reefs. We synthesized available observations of foraging metrics in relation to fish body size and found considerable variation, even among closely related species. We then applied these allometric functions to survey data and calculated rates of herbivory for acanthurids and scarines, which make up the vast majority of herbivorous fish biomass in the Pacific. Estimated rates of algal consumption, area scraped, and bioerosion varied across islands, with noticeable differences that may align with the relative influence of human population density among underlying herbivore functional groups. We found no evidence of compensatory relationships among herbivore processes whereby decreasing rates in one type of herbivory is offset by increasing rates in another. We observed nonlinear, positive relationships between fish biomass and rates of herbivory. Yet, for a given biomass, the corresponding rates of herbivory varied among regions, and we observed instances where islands with the greatest biomass did not also have the highest rates of herbivory. Islands with the largest size classes of herbivores did not consistently exhibit greater rates of herbivory, and we did not find a clear, consistent pattern between the number of fish species and corresponding rates of herbivore processes. Cropping Acanthurus spp. provided the greatest proportion of algal consumption at every island, yet no single species accounted for the majority of this process, whereas we identified parrotfish species that provided >75% of scraping or bioerosion at certain islands. Our results emphasize the importance of considering the species and size composition of herbivore assemblages when estimating processes, rather than relying on total biomass alone. Lastly, we highlight gaps in foraging observations and additional work needed to further broaden our ability to quantify the ecological processes of herbivores.

AB  - Mammalian carnivore diversity within the Reserva Natural del Bosque Mbaracayu in eastern Paraguay is represented by five families (Canidae, Mephitidae, Mustelidae, Procyonidae, and Felidae) and includes large-bodied, apex predators, several omnivores, and numerous mesocarnivores. The competitive exclusion principle argues that sustained spatial and temporal coexistence of two or more species with identical ecological requirements is unsustainable. The Reserve is a mosaic of habitats that has become isolated due to extensive deforestation of the surrounding Upper Parana Atlantic Forest. Nevertheless, it is remarkable in that 16 mammalian carnivore species are documented as coexisting within the Reserve. We sought to determine the extent to which this diverse community is mitigating competition through the partitioning of available niche space by assessing dietary ecology of mammalian carnivores present, including diet breadths and dietary overlap, and by examining spatial patterns within the reserve. Feces were collected from all 16 mammalian carnivore species from seven areas within the reserve and specific identifications were confirmed by molecular analyses. Diet breadth, (B) over cap, standardized diet breadth, (B) over cap (A), and Pianka's Index for dietary overlap, (O) over cap, were calculated. A Chi-square goodness-of-fit test was performed to test for randomness of samples associated with survey areas. Diet analyses indicated a spectrum from dietary generalists to specialists. Species segregated into six dietary guilds, defined as groups of species with (O) over cap > 0.5. Four guilds included only one species each (Neotropical otter, crab-eating fox, jaguar, and puma). The low dietary overlap between jaguar and puma contrasts with studies conducted elsewhere. One guild consisted of four highly omnivorous species (maned wolf, Molina's hog-nosed skunk, crab-eating raccoon, and South American coati). The sixth guild included eight species which mostly consumed small vertebrates, primarily mammals as well as birds and reptiles (bush dog, two mustelines, five small felids). The mustelines (tayra and lesser grison) had extremely high dietary overlap. Although they did not segregate spatially, they are known to occupy distinct niches in vertically stratified forests. The five small felids also showed extremely high dietary overlap. Three of them were found to segregate spatially within the Reserve and two did not, although one (jaguarundi) is known to segregate temporally, being more active diurnally. The exceptionally rich community of mammalian carnivore species at the Reserva Natural del Bosque Mbaracayu appeared to avoid unsustainable competition by a variety of mechanisms, some utilizing different food items, or, in the case of high dietary overlap, utilizing spatial or temporal resources differently.

AB  - Translocations are essential for the establishment of new populations of the critically endangered black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis), but success will largely depend on forage availability. We investigated the degree of competition for woody browse between African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) and a recently reintroduced population of rhinoceroses in Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe in the dry season of 2022. We examined overlap in space use and selection for plant species, stem diameters, and feeding height by measuring use of shrubs by both species at 75 sites across a range of topo-edaphic conditions. Areas heavily used by rhinoceroses had high shrub densities, were close to water, and were on alkaline soils with elevated conductivity. Sites with medium to high levels of rhinoceros use were nested within areas of high elephant use. We also observed high elephant use in areas not favored by rhinoceroses, occurring farther from water and having lower shrub densities. Both species avoided thickets on acidic soils. There was substantial overlap in feeding areas, the plant species selected, and foraging height, although elephants used stems with larger diameters than rhinoceroses. Feeding by elephants on woody plants often resulted in a proliferation of small-diameter coppice stems, which rhinoceroses used more than non-coppice growth. Elephants did not appear to favor small coppice stems, indicating a degree of elephant-induced facilitation of browse for rhinoceroses. Evidence for competition with elephants indicates black rhinoceroses may be best introduced into areas with a low elephant density.

AB  - Simple Summary Simple Summary: Local breeds of pigs often do not require special housing and feeding conditions. This makes it possible to obtain high-quality meat products under eco-friendly conditions. The Livni breed is a local Russian pig breed, which is the only one adapted to pasture-based housing and produces pork of excellent quality in environmentally friendly conditions. We evaluated the genetic diversity of the Livni breed in comparison with the Large White and Landrace breeds and investigated changes in the Livni breed populations' structure over the period from the 1970s to the present, using whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphisms. Both the museum and modern Livni pig populations are characterized by higher genetic diversity and were subject to less selection pressure than commercial pig populations. Present-day populations of the Livni pigs have retained their historical genomic components despite the use of commercial breeds in breeding efforts. This suggests their potential suitability for future breeding programs.Abstract The pig industry is usually considered an intensive livestock industry, mainly supported by hybrid breeding between commercial pig breeds. However, people's pursuit of a more natural environment and higher meat quality has led to an increasing demand for eco-friendly and diverse pig feeding systems. Therefore, the importance of rearing and conserving local pig breeds is increasing. The Livni pig is a local breed with good adaptability to the environmental and fodder conditions in central Russia. In this study, we aimed to analyze the genetic diversity and population structure of Livni pigs using whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. We utilized the Porcine GGP HD BeadChip on genotype samples from old (n = 32, 2004) and modern (n = 32, 2019) populations of Livni pigs. For the museum samples of Livni pigs (n = 3), we extracted DNA from their teeth, performed genomic sequencing, and obtained SNP genotypes from the whole-genome sequences. SNP genotypes of Landrace (n = 32) and Large White (n = 32) pigs were included for comparative analysis. We observed that the allelic richness of Livni pigs was higher than those of Landrace and Large White pigs (AR = 1.775-1.798 vs. 1.703 and 1.668, respectively). The effective population size estimates (NE5 = 108 for Livni pigs, NE5 = 59 for Landrace and Large White pigs) confirmed their genetic diversity tendency. This was further supported by the length and number of runs of homozygosity, as well as the genomic inbreeding coefficient (almost twofold lower in Livni pigs compared to Landrace and Large White pigs). These findings suggest that the Livni pig population exhibits higher genetic diversity and experiences lower selection pressure compared to commercial pig populations. Furthermore, both principal component and network tree analyses demonstrated a clear differentiation between Livni pigs and transboundary commercial pigs. The TreeMix results indicated gene flow from Landrace ancestors to Livni pigs (2019) and from Large White ancestors to Livni pigs (2004), which was consistent with their respective historical breeding backgrounds. The comparative analysis of museum, old, and modern Livni pigs indicated that the modern Livni pig populations have preserved their historical genomic components, suggesting their potential suitability for future design selection programs.

AB  - Fisheries bycatch is the main threat to sea turtle populations in marine habitats in the Mediterranean Sea. Bycatch in set nets accounts for 30,000 catches yearly, which combined with mortality rates of up to 82.6 %, makes it the deadliest fishing gear in the region. The Adriatic Sea is one of the most important foraging and developmental habitats for loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the Mediterranean. Bycatch in the Adriatic small-scale set net fishery is estimated at over 8900 individuals per year placing its mitigation among international conservation priorities. Use of light emitting diodes (LED lights) of different wavelengths as bycatch deterrents was proposed as an effective conservation tool, reducing bycatch levels by up to 93 %. In the present study we: (i) quantified the effects of net illumination on loggerhead sea turtle bycatch rates and (ii) demonstrate the importance of regional validation of conservation tools effectiveness prior to their widespread adoption. We assessed the effects of green LED lights on sea turtle bycatch rates in 390 net pairs with total length of 1278 km monitored nets. We found no significant change in sea turtle bycatch rates as a result of net illumination. A significant decrease of 35 % of primary target catch was observed in illuminated trammel nets. Possible explanations include fluctuating turbidity and an adapted LED light attachment method. Observed sea turtle bycatch rates in unilluminated nets were up to 84 times lower than in comparable gears in Northern Adriatic Sea. Understanding the drivers behind the differing bycatch rates would be necessary before conservation decisions are made. Our study showed that the net illumination is not necessarily a silver bullet for bycatch mitigation in set nets globally, and that regional testing is a key requirement before its introduction in fisheries as a conservation tool.

AB  - Australia was isolated for approximately 40 million years from the presence of eutherian predation until the introduction of the dingo (Canis familiaris; 4000 years ago), foxes (Vulpes vulpes; 1871) and feral cats (Felis catus; post-1788). The arrival of these invasive species coincides with the decline and extinction of many native mammals, specifically within the critical weight range (35-5500 g). These extinctions are likely a result of competition and predation, where locomotor performance and the associated behaviours contribute largely to overall fitness. We used the population responses of native fauna in the presence of introduced predators to establish a research framework. Introduction/extinction timelines, predator diets, and prey occurrence were used to identify invasive/native relationships where predation may define the population outcome. We then examined the locomotor performance of these species using current data (maximum speeds). Consumption of prey items does not seem to be associated with the probability of the predator encountering the prey. Dingoes had the most variable mammalian prey of all invasive predators, likely due to higher maximal speeds. Feral cats favour Dasyuridae and smaller species, preying upon these prey groups more than dingoes and foxes. The role of locomotor performance in invasive ecology is not well understood; we identified relationships for further exploration.

AB  - Material fluxes between ecosystems subsidize consumers in recipient ecosystems. While alpine zones are generally regarded as isolated, arthropods from lower elevations may be deposited on the snow surface in alpine zones by flight or wind. This arthropod fallout should be essential food resources for alpine consumers that are forced to deal with scarce food in environments. In this study, the source location of arthropods that fell onto the alpine snowpack was examined using data of their host plants. Furthermore, seasonal changes in the arthropod diets of two insectivorous and one primarily herbivorous alpine bird species were evaluated by fecal DNA metabarcoding with correction of PCR amplification bias among arthropod taxa using DNA mock assemblages of arthropods. We present quantitative evidence that winged aphids originating from the subalpine and montane zones are abundant on the snowpack. These subsidized aphids accounted for approximately 40% of the arthropod portion of the diet, and 6%-40% of the overall diet, of these birds during their early breeding seasons. Our findings indicate that material fluxes from foothill areas contribute to the maintenance of biotic communities in alpine ecosystems during less productive seasons.

AB  - Large ungulate populations are known to cause economic damage to agriculture and forestry. Bark damage is particularly detrimental to the timber production of certain species, including Picea abies (L.) Karst. (Norway spruce): after bark is wounded, rot often spreads in the trunk base, damaging the most valuable trunk section. Numerous studies have provided valuable information on various aspects of this process, but the financial consequences over a full timber production cycle remained poorly quantified and uncertain. To fill this gap, we coupled a forest dynamics model (GYMNOS) with models of damage occurrence and decay spread. We simulated the effect of ranging levels of bark-stripping damage on financial losses. The simulations were repeated for sites of ranging fertility and with different protection measures (fences or individual protections), in Southern Belgium. The net present values of these different simulations were estimated and compared to estimate the cost of the damage and the cost-effectiveness of the damage protections. Protecting plantations against bark-stripping damage with fences was found unlikely to be worthwhile. By contrast, individual protections placed on crop trees could be helpful, particularly in the most fertile stands. Loss of revenue depended greatly on the factors tested: we estimated that the average damage cost could be about 53euro/ha/year, reducing timber yield by 19%. A model was built to predict the damage cost for different values of the discount rate, site index and bark-stripping rate. This model could help develop more effective management of Norway spruce plantations and deer populations.

AB  - European bison (Bison bonasus) were successfully reintroduced in many free or semi-free areas across Europe during the last decades. Due to the increased numbers, the conflicts between human activities and bison are more frequent. Therefore the knowledge about spatial activity and habitat preference in new regions is the need for management decision making. We studied daily and seasonal habitat use of the semi-free European bison herd in the Czech Republic from 2014 to 2019. The lead cows of the herd were collared with the GPS devices with a 30-minutes GPS fixes interval. The bison herd strongly preferred the managed open areas and supplementary feeding stations during the seasons (Jacob's index from 0.49 to 0.99). On the contrary, they avoided the forest type and unmanaged open habitats (Jacob ' s index from -0.23 to -0.69). The managed meadows and feeding places they used almost exclusively during the night while the forest during the day-light.

AB  - In 2005, 3 wildlife underpasses were installed on a section of U.S. Highway 64 in Washington County, North Carolina, USA, with a 3 m tall, chain link exclusion fence passing under the road and extending >= 800 m from each underpass in both directions and parallel to the highway. Over time, the fencing developed gaps, potentially reducing the efficacy of the underpasses. From 2019 to 2021 we monitored wildlife activity using passive infrared cameras at the underpasses and 15 gaps in the fencing. Our goals were to determine differences in species' use of the fence gaps vs. underpasses and what factors influence wildlife gap-use behaviors. Wildlife gap-use behaviors were species-specific. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), northern raccoons (Procyon lotor), bobcats (Lynx rufus), and black bears (Ursus americanus) had >50% of their observed events using the underpasses, while canids, aquatic mammals, rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus and S. palustris), and Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) were detected >50% of their events using the gaps. All species/taxonomic groups were observed using the gaps in the fencing. When detected below the underpasses, all taxonomic groups except aquatic mammals were observed on the outside, or roadside, side of the fence. We regressed species, season, year, gap size, gap distance from underpass, and frequency a species was walking parallel to the fence to the proportion of events a species was observed on the roadside of the fence with the highway. Our regression model (F 9,947 = 16.23, P < 0.001) indicated that groups used the gaps at different rates. We observed approximately a 19% decrease in gap use between 2019 and 2021. Additionally, the percentage of events where animals were observed walking parallel to the fence on the safe side-without passing through the gap-was positively correlated with gap use at 0.03. Animals tended to use gaps associated with underpasses that had wider horizontal clearances as opposed to gaps near underpasses with narrower horizontal clearances. Similarly, animals used gaps that had taller vertical clearances more than gaps with shorter vertical clearances. Wildlife exclusion fence maintenance is often neglected, and post-construction studies generally focus on crossing structures. When fencing is left unattended, gaps can develop, creating the potential for more wildlife-vehicle collisions. Our study highlights the importance of long-term monitoring and maintenance of wildlife crossings and fencing designs, emphasizing their implications for effective and safe animal movement.

AB  - Animals are strongly connected to the environments they live in and may become adapted to local environments. Examining genetic-environment associations of key indicator species, like seabirds, provides greater insights into the forces that drive evolution in marine systems. Here we examined a RADseq dataset of 19,213 SNPs for 99 rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) from five western Pacific and 10 eastern Pacific breeding colonies. We used partial redundancy analyses to identify candidate adaptive loci and to quantify the effects of environmental variation on population genetic structure. We identified 262 candidate adaptive loci, which accounted for 3.0% of the observed genetic variation among western Pacific and eastern Pacific breeding colonies. Genetic variation was more strongly associated with pH and maximum current velocity, than maximum sea surface temperature. Genetic-environment associations explain genetic differences between western and eastern Pacific populations; however, genetic variation within the western and eastern Pacific Ocean populations appears to follow a pattern of isolation-by-distance. This study represents a first to quantify the relationship between environmental and genetic variation for this widely distributed marine species and provides greater insights into the evolutionary forces that act on marine species.

AB  - Distinguishing between selective and opportunistic hunting is a major challenge in Paleolithic archaeology, requiring the comparison of the human hunting record to the usually unknown natural prey abundance. Open-air hunting camps are ubiquitous in the Eurasian Middle Paleolithic (MP) record, alongside cave sites, and are often dominated by large-bodied species. In the Levant, MP faunal records differ between caves and open-air sites: Caves are dominated by mountain gazelle and fallow deer, while open-air sites are more aurochs-dominated. This discrepancy can be explained by transport patterns, but whether the abundance of aurochs in open-air sites is due to deliberate targeting or natural abundance in the landscape is unclear. The Nesher Ramla open-air site is a natural sinkhole in central Israel with an 8-m-deep MP sequence. Detailed zooarchaeological, dental wear, and isotope analyses of the upper sequence fauna found a highly diverse assemblage dominated by medium-sized ungulates in the uppermost phases (Units I and IIa). Results concerning ungulate dietary niches and isotopic signatures demonstrate that animals from different biomes and topographies congregated at the site. Evidence of human butchery is infrequent and fewer than carnivore modifications. Several articulated vertebral columns attest to in situ preservation. Our results demonstrate that the Nesher Ramla's uppermost sequence formed primarily under natural conditions, suggesting that it was a site of opportunistic hunting by humans and carnivores, probably targeting ungulates that came to the sinkhole to drink. Therefore, we consider this assemblage representative of the site's "natural" environment and use it as a benchmark for comparing assemblages and hunting strategies. Thus, we observe a clear difference between our case study and those recovered from the site's lower layers (Unit IIB and below) and other open-air sites. For the first time, we can show that the abundance of large bovines in MP open-air sites is not necessarily due to their abundance in the environment but to deliberate human planning and selective hunting.

AB  - The degradation of marine ecosystems is a growing concern worldwide, emphasizing the need for efficient tools to assess their ecological status. Herein, a novel ecosystem-based ecological evaluation index of shallow rocky reefs is introduced and tested in the Aegean and Ionian Seas (NE Mediterranean). The index focuses on a specific set of pre-selected species, including habitat-forming, key, commercially important, and non-indigenous species, across a wide range of trophic levels (1.00-4.53). Data acquisition is conducted through rapid non-destructive SCUBA diving surveys to assess all macroscopic food web components (macroalgae, invertebrates, and fish). Two versions of the index, ECOfast and ECOfast-NIS, were developed, each applying a different approach to account for the impact of non-indigenous species. In our case study, the correlations between the two versions of the index and sea surface temperature, protection status, occurrence of carnivorous fish, and non-indigenous herbivores were assessed through generalized additive models (GAMs). The assessment assigned 93% (ECOfast) or 96% (ECOfast-NIS) of the sites to a moderate to bad ecological status, indicating an alarming situation in the shallow rocky reefs of the NE Mediterranean. Sites evaluated as poor or bad were characterized by extensive coverage of ephemeral macroalgae, absence or minimal presence of large indigenous carnivorous fish, and complete absence of one to three out of five invertebrate functional trophic groups. The community composition of macroalgae, herbivorous species, and carnivorous fishes differed between the 5 m and 15 m depth zones. Surface temperature and carnivorous fish occurrence were the most important tested predictors of the ecological status of shallow rocky reefs. The best GAMs showed that the ECOfast score declined with sea surface temperature and increased with the occurrence of carnivorous fish; ECOfast-NIS declined with sea surface temperature and the occurrence of non-indigenous fish and increased with the occurrence of carnivorous fish. The nondestructive and integrative nature of this approach, its speed of data acquisition and analysis, and its capacity to account for highly mobile predatory fish and non-indigenous species render the ECOfast index a novel, robust, and valuable tool for assessing the ecological status of shallow rocky reefs.

AB  - Reintroductions are a fundamental tool in wildlife management and conservation. Monitoring and reporting are crucial for establishing protocols for threatened species. Here we report the full translocation process of the very first reintroduction of the Apennine chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata) ever made that took place in Majella National Park (Central Apennines, Italy) with the release of 22 females and 18 males in 1991-2006 period. We described the pre and post release methodologies, the population and distribution dynamics, and the present status and structure of the population. Through systematic monitoring, we assessed the increase in distribution range (from 7.9 km(2) in 2000 up to 23.9 km(2) in 2022 for females with kids). Considering a time span of 25 years, the population now exceeds 1300 individuals and still shows a growing trend. Quite large mixed groups (up to > 200 individuals) are frequently seen while the largest male-only group ever seen thus far numbered 71 individuals. Overall sex ratio MM:FF reached 1.1, while the birth rate decreased from 0.70 to 0.80 in early 2010 ' s to 0.35-0.55 in 2021-2022, showing a potential density dependence effect and highlighting the importance of long-term monitoring to identify potential limiting factors to habitat suitability or carrying capacity of reintroduced populations.

AB  - Consumers respond differently to external nutrient changes than producers, resulting in a mismatch in elemental composition between them and potentially having a significant impact on their interactions. To explore the responses of herbivores and omnivores to changes in elemental composition in producers, we develop a novel stoichiometric model with an intraguild predation structure. The model is validated using experimental data, and the results show that our model can well capture the growth dynamics of these three species. Theoretical and numerical analyses reveal that the model exhibits complex dynamics, including chaotic-like oscillations and multiple types of bifurcations, and undergoes long transients and regime shifts. Under moderate light intensity and phosphate concentration, these three species can coexist. However, when the light intensity is high or the phosphate concentration is low, the energy enrichment paradox occurs, leading to the extinction of ciliate and Daphnia. Furthermore, if phosphate is sufficient, the competitive effect of ciliate and Daphnia on algae will be dominant, leading to competitive exclusion. Notably, when the phosphorus-to-carbon ratio of ciliate is in a suitable range, the energy enrichment paradox can be avoided, thus promoting the coexistence of species. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of species coexistence and biodiversity.

AB  - Human-elephant conflict is growing in Africa as human populations and development increases, creating disturbance to elephant habitats. Beehive fences have been trialed as a coexistence tool with some success but all studies have looked at small sample sizes over a short time period. Our study analyses the behavior of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) that approached a network of beehive fence protected farms in two conflict villages over 9 years next to Tsavo East National Park. We compare differences in elephant raids and beehive occupation rates annually, during a drought, and during peak crop production seasons. Out of 3999 elephants approaching our study farms 1007 elephants broke the beehive fence and entered the protected farm areas (25.18%). This was significantly less than the 2649 encounters where elephants remained either outside the farm boundary or broke into the control farms (66.24%). A further 343 elephants entered the farm by walking through a gap at the end of a fence (8.56%). The annual beehive fence break-through rates averaged 23.96% (+/- SE 3.15) resulting in a mean of 76.04% elephants deterred from beehive fences protected farm plots. Over six peak crop growing seasons the beehive fences kept between 78.3% and 86.3% of elephants out of the farms and crops. The beehive fences produced one ton of honey sold for $2250; however, a drought caused a 75% reduction in hive occupation rates and honey production for 3 years after negatively impacting honey profits and the effectiveness of the fences. Beehive fences are very effective at reducing up to 86.3% of elephant crop-raids during peak crop seasons after good rainfall, but any increase in elephant habitat disturbance or the frequency and duration of droughts could reduce their effectiveness as a successful coexistence tool.

AB  - T & uuml;rkiye represents an important biogeographic region connecting Southeast Europe with Southwest Asia, where pig domestication began in the western Palearctic. We studied the phylogenetic relationships and spatial distribution of new and published mitochondrial D-loop sequences of wild boars from T & uuml;rkiye, other parts of the Middle East, and from around the world to understand migration patterns within Asia Minor and other parts of the Middle East as well as across the Bosphorus/Sea of Marmara/Dardanelles, a current migration barrier to Southwest Europe. Our phylogenetic (ML, BI) and spatial (Geneland) analyses revealed haplotypes both endemic to Anatolia and with a wider distribution in the Middle East as well as European (E1) lineages. The latter suggested possible rare immigration into Anatolia at present times and prehistorical/historical anthropogenic translocations of wild boars or pigs, such as during the pre-Hellenic, Roman, and Byzantine periods or during the European crusades, and subsequent introgression into Anatolian wild boars. Import of pigs with E1 haplotypes and introgression into wild boars during the medieval Empire of Trebizond particularly by Italian merchants or settlers, is also suggested. Anatolian lineages that may have formed the basis of the archaic domestication process of pigs in the western Palearctic are discussed.

AB  - During the Cretaceous, large herbivorous dinosaurs (megaherbivores) acted as keystone species-just as large mammals do today (e.g., elephants)-yet despite their significance in Cretaceous ecosystems, what plant taxa these dinosaurs ate is unclear. The Albian armoured dinosaur Borealopelta markmitchelli (Ornithischia; Nodo-sauridae) was discovered in northern Alberta, Canada and has well-preserved stomach contents dominated by fern leaf tissues, with low amounts of gymnosperm material, implying selective feeding. The lower Albian Gates Formation (Grande Cache Member) macroflora of central Alberta is contemporaneous and spatially proximal with B. markmitchelli and therefore provides information on local vegetation available to this nodosaurid and other megaherbivores in this area. In this study we provide census-sampled abundance data for the Gates For-mation macroflora. These data also provide the means to further investigate the feeding ecology of Borealopelta by summarizing the vegetation and local food options available. Census collections at five sites within the Grande Cache Member exposed in the Grande Cache Coal Mine reveal that the local vegetation there was dominated by conifers (44-70%) across all sites. Athrotaxites, Elatides, and Pityocladus were the most common conifers. Other gymnosperms present were ginkgophytes (e.g., Ginkgoites; 11%) and Taeniopteris (9%). Caytoniales (Sagenopteris) were found at one study site but uncommon (2%). Ferns (e.g., Cladophlebis, Coniopteris, Gleichenites) accounted for 14% of the total site counts while cycadophytes (Bennettitales; 4%) and Equisetites (1%) were less common. When comparing the Gates Formation macroflora to the stomach contents of Borealopelta, these data suggest that B. markmitchelli was selectively feeding on ferns, or in a recently disturbed fern-dense area within the local landscape.

AB  - Simple Summary Fat deposition capacity greatly impacts the production capacity of sheep. The production of high amounts of fat affects the economic benefits of animals. Gastrointestinal microorganisms play an important role in the characteristics of host fat deposition. This study compares differences in gastrointestinal microorganisms in sheep with different body mass indices. Results showed that there were different microflora compositions among different groups. This provides a new idea for the regulation of fat deposition traits in sheep. Fat deposition is the key factor affecting the efficiency of animal husbandry production. There are many factors affecting fat deposition, in which the gastrointestinal microbiota plays an important role. Therefore, the body mass index (BMI) was introduced into the evaluation of sheep fat deposition, and the different microbiota and functional pathways of the sheep gastrointestinal tract in different BMI groups were analyzed. We selected 5% of individuals with the highest and lowest BMI from a feed test population (357 in whole group). Microorganisms in 10 sites of the gastrointestinal tract in 36 individuals (18 in each group) were evaluated by 16S rRNA V3-V4 region sequencing. There were differences (p < 0.05) in fat deposition traits between different BMI groups. In the 10 parts of the gastrointestinal tract, the diversity and richness of cecal microflora in the high-BMI group were higher than those in low-BMI Hu sheep (p < 0.05). Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed that there was separation of the cecum between groups, and there were differences in the cecal microbial community. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) showed that most biomarkers were in the cecum. On the basis of an indepth study of cecal microorganisms, 26 different bacterial genera were obtained (p < 0.05). Correlation analysis between them and the characteristics of fat deposition in sheep showed that Colidextribacter, Alloprevotella, and Succenivibrio were positively correlated with fat deposition, while Lachnospiraceae_ND3007_Group was negatively correlated (p < 0.05). The above results show that the cecum may be an important part leading to the difference of BMI in sheep, and its microorganisms may affect the level of fat deposition.

AB  - Ecotones are responsive to environmental change and pave a path for succession as they move across the landscape. We investigated the biotic and abiotic filters to species establishment on opposite ends of a tidal marsh-forest ecotone that is moving inland in response to sea level rise. We transplanted four plant species common to the ecotone to the leading or trailing edge of the migrating ecotone, with and without caging to protect them from ungulate herbivores. We found that species exhibited an individualistic response to abiotic and biotic pressures in this ecotone; three species performed better at the leading edge of the ecotone in the coastal forest, whereas one performed better at the trailing edge in the marsh. Specifically, grass species Phragmites australis and Panicum virgatum grew more in the low light and low salinity conditions of the leading edge of the ecotone (forest), whereas the shrub Iva frutescens grew better in the high light, high salinity conditions of the trailing edge of the ecotone (marsh). Furthermore, of the four species, only P. australis was affected by the biotic pressure of herbivory by an introduced ungulate, Cervus nippon, which greatly reduced its biomass and survival at the leading edge (forest). P. australis is an aggressive invasive species and has been observed to dominate in the wake of migrating marsh-forest ecotones. Our findings detail the role of lower salinity stress to promote and herbivory pressure to inhibit the establishment of P. australis during shifts of this ecotone, and also highlight an interaction between two nonnative species, P. australis and C. nippon. Understanding migration of the marsh-forest ecotone and the factors controlling P. australis establishment are critical for marsh conservation in the face of sea level rise. More generally, our findings support the conclusion that the abiotic and biotic filters of a migrating ecotone shape the resulting community.

AB  - Recent sampling efforts and examinations of museum material provided evidence for a complex of species within Acroteriobatus leucospilus (Norman, 1926). The present manuscript contains a redescription of A. leucospilus involving the syntypes and additional material, as well as formal descriptions of two new species of Acroteriobatus Giltay, 1928. All specimens of both new species were found in the western Indian Ocean. Individuals of the first new species, hereafter referred to as Acroteriobatus andysabini sp. nov., were identified originating from Madagascar, and specimens of the second new species, hereafter referred to as Acroteriobatus stehmanni sp. nov., were only found off Socotra Islands at the junction between the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. Both new species appear to be endemic to the respective region and allopatric to A. leucospilus and occur in coastal waters to at least 80 m and 43 m depth, respectively. They differ from A. leucospilus in a number of characteristics including the maximum size and coloration in fresh. Acroteriobatus andysabini sp. nov. is a large species growing to more than 100 cm total length (TL) and with elongated bluish-gray spots on snout giving "stripe-nosed" appearance; numerous small bluish-gray spots on pectoral, pelvic, dorsal, and caudal fms; brown spots on trunk and fm bases; lateral tail folds striped orange and white; and ventral surface largely white but with a V-shape pattern of faint to dark speckled black spots on snout tip. Acroteriobatus stehmanni sp. nov. is a small species growing to similar to 62 cm TL and with sparse patterning with small bluish-gray circular spots confined to snout tip, posterior pectoral-fin margins, a pair on midbody, and few on posterior pelvic-fin margins, rather indistinct small to larger dark brown spots, and lateral tail folds and ventral surface white. Acroteriobatus leucospilus is a medium-sized species growing to similar to 96 cm TL and with patterning similar to A. andysabini sp. nov. but ventral surface uniformly white and lateral tail folds white or striped blue and brown. Taxonomical differences include nasal lamellae counts (42-48 in A. andysabini sp. nov. vs. 43-48 in A. stehmanni sp. nov. vs. 37-41 in A. leucospilus), snout angle (76-85 degrees vs. 71-77 degrees vs. 68-81 degrees), and dorsal head length (24.2-33.5% vs. 17.2-22.8% TL vs. 24.0-29.2% TL). A key to the species of Acroteriobatus is given for the first time.

AB  - Avocado lace bug, Pseudocysta perseae (Heidemann) (Hemiptera: Tingidae), is a sap-feeding insect that feeds on the underside of avocado leaves. First observed in 2019, P. perseae has spread throughout the Hawaiian islands, causing premature leaf drop and decrease in avocado yield. Due to Hawai'i's approximately 200 cultivars comprised of all 3 avocado races with extensive racial hybrids, we were able to investigate whether certain cultivars were more prone to experiencing higher P. perseae abundances and infestations compared to others. We conducted longitudinal abundance surveys on Hawai'i Island across several common avocado varieties monitoring changes in P. perseae abundance. These surveys were supplemented with longitudinal infestation severity surveys across 4 avocado lineages (Mexican, Guatemalan, West Indian, and Guatemalan x West Indian hybrid). Additionally, we collected leaves of 'Sharwil', 'Hass', 'Kahalu'u', and 'Nishikawa' cultivars looking at associations between P. perseae abundance and cultivar, herbivory-related biomechanical traits, and soluble sugar content. We found that some cultivars, such as 'Malama', typically experience lower P. perseae abundances compared to cultivars such as 'Kahalu'u', 'Beshore', and 'Sharwil'. Guatemalan x West Indian hybrid trees were also shown to have a higher probability of experiencing more severe P. perseae infestations compared to other lineages. Lastly, soluble sugar content, specifically fructose content, had a positive effect on juvenile P. perseae abundance. These findings suggest that cultivar differences in P. perseae infestations may exist, but tree-to-tree leaf compositional differences, such as soluble sugar content, may be a large driver of variation in P. perseae abundance.

AB  - Remote sensing methods are commonly used to monitor the invasive riparian shrub tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) and its response to the northern tamarisk beetle (D. carinulata), a specialized herbivore introduced as a biocontrol agent to control tamarisk in the Southwest USA in 2001. We use a Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) supervised classification method with WorldView-2 (2 m spatial resolution) multispectral images from May and August of 2019 to map healthy tamarisk, canopy dieback, and defoliated tamarisk over a 48 km segment of the Colorado River in the topographically complex Grand Canyon National Park, where coarse-resolution satellite images are of limited use. The classifications in May and August produced overall accuracies of 80.0% and 83.1%, respectively. Seasonal change detection between May and August 2019 indicated that 47.5% of the healthy tamarisk detected in May 2019 had been defoliated by August 2019 within the WorldView-2 image extent. When compared to a previously published tamarisk map from 2009, derived from multispectral aerial imagery, we found that 29.5% of healthy tamarisk canopy declined between 2009 and 2019. This implies that tamarisk beetle impacts are continuing to accumulate even though land managers have noted the presence of the beetles in this reach of the river for 7 years since 2012.

AB  - Prey must balance resource acquisition with predator avoidance for survival and reproduction. To reduce risk of predation, prey may avoid areas with high predator use, but if they are unable to due to resource acquisition requirements, they may instead change their habitat use or movement speed to mitigate predation risk. Prey risk response may depend on spatially or temporally varying forage availability as well as seasonal variation in prey vulnerability and availability of alternate foods for predators. To quantify how prey respond to spatial and temporal variation in risk of brown bear predation, we examined Roosevelt elk (Cervus canadensis roosevelti) spatiotemporal behavior responses to brown bear (Ursus arctos) habitat use on Afognak and Raspberry islands, Alaska, using Global Positioning System location data during elk parturition (20 May-15 June), summer (16 June-20 September), and autumn (21 September-10 November). During parturition and summer, elk used forest and shrub landcover in areas of higher brown bear probability of use. During parturition, elk used areas with lower forage productivity in areas of higher bear probability of use, and movement speed decreased with higher bear probability of use, especially in shrub landcover. During summer, elk used areas with higher forage productivity in areas of higher brown bear probability of use. During autumn, elk were less likely to use areas with higher bear habitat probability of use across landcover categories and forage productivity. During summer and autumn, elk movement speed increased with higher brown bear probability of use. Elk behavioral response to risk of brown bear predation could increase energy expenditure and decrease their ability to acquire forage, therefore negatively impacting survival and reproduction with spatiotemporal variation in risk response potentially amplifying these impacts.

AB  - The evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis encapsulates the importance of evolution and ecology for biological invasions. According to this proposition, leaving specialist herbivores at home frees introduced plant species from investing limited resources in defense to instead use those resources for growth, selecting for individuals with reduced defense, enhanced growth, and, consequently, increased competitive ability. We took a multispecies approach, including ancestral and non-native populations of seven weeds, as well as seven coexisting local weeds, to explore all three predictions (i.e., lower defense, greater growth, and better ability to compete in non-native than ancestral populations), the generality as an invasion mechanism for a given system, and community-level consequences of EICA. We assessed plant defenses by conducting herbivory trials with a generalist herbivore. Therefore, finding that non-native populations are better defended than ancestral populations would lend support to the shifting defense (SD) hypothesis, an extension of EICA that incorporates the observation that introduced species escape specialists, but encounter generalists. We also manipulated water additions to evaluate how resource availability influences competition in the context of EICA and plant plasticity in our semiarid system. We found that non-native populations of one study species, Centaurea solstitialis, were better defended, grew faster, and exerted stronger suppression on locals than ancestral populations, offering support to EICA through the SD hypothesis. The other species also displayed variation in trait attributes between ancestral and non-native populations, but they did not fully comply with the three predictions of EICA. Notably, differences between those populations generally favored the non-natives. Moreover, non-native populations were, overall, superior at suppressing locals relative to ancestral populations under low water conditions. There were no differences in plasticity among all three groups. These results suggest that evolutionary change between ancestral and non-native populations is widespread and could have facilitated invasion in our system. Additionally, although trading growth for shifted defense does not seem to be the main operational path for evolutionary change, it may explain the dominance of some introduced species in ruderal communities. Because introduced species dominate communities in disturbed environments around the world, our results are likely generalizable to other systems.

AB  - If not carefully managed, harvesting of Antarctic krill risks disturbing the ecological balance of many Antarctic and sub-Antarctic sites where krill-dependent predators feed. One of the least disturbed sites anywhere within the Southern Ocean and one where krill fishing has so far been virtually non-existent is the South Sandwich Islands volcanic archipelago. Some of the main krill predators breeding at the South Sandwich Islands are penguins, with five species breeding on the islands, the dominant species of which is the chinstrap penguin. In this paper we report on the results of ARGOS PTT deployments during the chinstrap penguin chick-rearing period, using the recorded foraging trips to develop habitat models. Foraging habitats used by chinstrap penguins during this period were best characterised by distance from the colony and sea surface temperature and, using these two covariates, we predicted the chick-rearing foraging habitat use around all islands. We show that the provisions of the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands Marine Protected Area ensure that chinstrap penguins, and other krill-dependent predators with similar foraging ranges, likely have robust protection during the summer. During the winter, when krill predators are likely to forage further offshore, seasonal sea ice provides a physical barrier to exclude the fishery, again ensuring the islands??? unique biodiversity receives strong protection. However, to the north of the marginal sea ice zone, competition between krill predators and the fishery could exist if the fishery were ever to explore new locations for resource extraction. We make a number of conclusions, including the need for winter tracking data to inform future management options.

AB  - Sexually selected traits show large variation and rapid evolution across the animal kingdom, yet genetic variation often persists within populations despite apparent directional selection. A key step in solving this long-standing paradox is to determine the genetic architecture of sexually selected traits to understand evolutionary drivers and constraints at the genomic level. Antlers are a form of sexual weaponry in male red deer (Cervus elaphus). On the island of Rum, Scotland, males with larger antlers have increased breeding success, yet there has been no evidence of any response to selection at the genetic level. To try and understand the mechanisms underlying this observation, we investigate the genetic architecture of ten antler traits and their principal components using genomic data from >38,000 SNPs. We estimate the heritabilities and genetic correlations of the antler traits using a genomic relatedness approach. We then use genome-wide association and haplotype-based regional heritability to identify regions of the genome underlying antler morphology, and an empirical Bayes approach to estimate the underlying distributions of allele effect sizes. We show that antler morphology is highly repeatable over an individual's lifetime, heritable and has a polygenic architecture and that almost all antler traits are positively genetically correlated with some loci identified as having pleiotropic effects. Our findings suggest that a large mutational target and genetic covariances among antler traits, in part maintained by pleiotropy, are likely to contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation in antler morphology in this population.

AB  - It remains unclear how long-term and different intensities of grazing affect the soil infiltration process, total nitrogen (TN), organic carbon (SOC), and grain size of desert steppes of Inner Mongolia, China. We quantified the effects of consecutive years of grazing from 2004 to 2018 on the soil particle size distribution (PSD, using the American soil classification system), mean soil infiltration rate (r), and cumulative infiltration volume (VC), in addition to the contents of SOC and TN, and their ratio (C/N). We defined grazing intensity at four levels, as non-grazed enclosure (NG, 0-), light (LG, 0.15-), moderate (MG, 0.30-), and heavy grazing (HG, 0.45 sheep per month per hectare steppe). The annual grazing period lasted from May to November. We established twelve adjacent experimental plots containing three replications for each grazing intensity. In July 2018, we collected 600 soil samples (0-40 cm soil depth: 4 depths with a 10-cm interval) in the plots (50 per plot) in a sigmoid configu-ration, to determine the PSD, SOC, TN, and C/N. Grazing evidently changed the PSD in diameter ranges of 20-150 (fine particles) and 200-500 mu m (coarse particles). Grazing significantly decreased the uniformity and distribution range of PSD but increased its dispersion, and these changes were most pronounced in the topsoil (0-10 cm depth). LG promoted r and VC, whose augmentation was evident within the initial 10 min of the infiltration process. The Kostiakov infiltration model was better at dynamically and quantitatively fitting the changing process of r than either the Horton or Philip model. Compared with NG, LG and MG significantly increased both SOC and TN (p < 0.01) whereas these were significantly decreased under HG (p < 0.01). Across differing grazing intensities, topsoil SOC contents can be well predicted by the range and heterogeneity of PSD, as well as the fraction of fine soil particles. These results are helpful for better understanding how continuous grazing impacts soil characteristics and for specifically enacting reasonable grazing scenarios to mitigate desertification on vulnerable desert steppes.

AB  - Simple Summary Many viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus 1, influenza virus, or Rift Valley fever virus, cause cell damage by generating reactive oxygen species and altering redox homeostasis. However, cells have developed various antioxidant mechanisms. We assumed that small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV), which has been found to infect sheep and goats worldwide can also disrupt the homeostasis of animals. SRLV target organs are the joints, lungs, brain, and the udder. To our knowledge, no information exists on the influence of SRLV infection on the oxidative processes occurring in goats. Understanding the influence of viral infection on oxidative stress may help develop novel antiviral treatments. Our study aimed to examine the effects of SRLV infection on oxidative stress biomarkers in the serum of dairy goats during lactation. No differences in any studied parameter at any stage of lactation were found between infected and uninfected goats. On the other hand, significant differences in almost all investigated parameters were found between stages of lactation, regardless of the infection status of goats. In conclusion, asymptomatic SRLV-infected goats do not reveal any apparent dysfunctions in serum oxidative stress biomarkers compared to their uninfected counterparts. The only changes in oxidative stress biomarkers observed during lactation appear to reflect the metabolic effort associated with milk production and developing pregnancy. The present study examines the effects of natural infection by small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) in the two most common goat breeds in Poland, i.e., Polish white improved and polish fawn improved. It focuses on biomarkers of oxidative stress, oxidatively modified proteins and antioxidant defenses, ceruloplasmin level as an acute phase protein, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes in the goat serum. It was conducted on 24 goats divided into two equal groups: one SRLV-seropositive (SRLV-SP) and another SRLV-seronegative (SRLV-SN). Both groups were identical in terms of breed and parity. Despite infection, the SRLV-SP goats demonstrated no symptoms of caprine arthritis-encephalitis. In addition, the SRLV-SP goats did not reveal pronounced dysfunctions in oxidative stress biomarkers in the serum compared to the SRLV-SN animals. However, both groups demonstrated elevated levels of the aldehydic and ketonic derivatives of oxidatively modified proteins during the lactation period. In addition, both groups retained a high total antioxidant capacity in serum despite the decrease of enzyme antioxidant defenses throughout the 200-day lactation period.

AB  - Herbivores are commonly classified as host specialists or generalists for various purposes, yet the definitions of these terms, and their intermediates, are often imprecise and ambiguous. We quantified host breadth for 240 non-native, tree-feeding insects in North America using phylogenetic diversity. We demonstrated that a partitioning of host breadth: (1) causes 67% of non-native insects to shift from a generalist to specialist category, (2) displays a reduction in host breadth from the native to introduced range, (3) identifies an inflection point in a model predicting the likelihood of non-native insect ecological impact, with a corresponding change in behaviour associated with specialists versus generalists, and (4) enables three models for strong prediction of whether a non-native forest insect will cause high impacts. Together, these results highlight the primacy of how herbivore host recognition and plant defences mediate whether novel host interactions will result in high impact after invasion.

AB  - Losses in crop yield due to invasive insects, weeds, pathogens, and herbivores cost trillions of dollars per year globally. To prevent further spread of invasive agricultural pest species, continuous monitoring and prevention are crucial. Once introduced, however, assessing the impact of an invasive pest on agricultural production and testing management strategies are essential. The green iguana ( Iguana iguana), a globally widespread invasive herbivore, is considered a possible agricultural pest although no quantitative data on its impact are available. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the invasive green iguana on cucumber ( Cucumis sativus, var. Dasher II) and lettuce ( Lactuca sativa, var. Black-seeded Simpson) yield by testing the efficacy of two management strategies - Neem-based pesticide and mesh fencing - compared to open field cultivation in Puerto Rico. Mesh fencing led to 20% more growth and doubled cucumber yield compared to open field cultivation, while spraying Neem led to an 18% increase in plant growth but no effect on cucumber yield. We found no difference in lettuce growth or yield among treatment and control plots. This study supports categorizing the green iguana as an invasive agricultural pest species and demonstrates the reptile's potential to reduce crop yield. It also shows that Neem application at the manufacturer's suggested concentration is not an effective mitigation technique for reducing crop loss due to green iguana herbivory. Government agencies in regions where the green iguana has the potential to be introduced should consider the species a threat to food production when developing monitoring programs and drafting regulations.

AB  - Apple production is among the most pesticide-intensive cultures. Recently, plastic rain shields and pest exclusion netting have emerged as potential measures to reduce the heavy reliance on chemical pesticides in apple, due to their inhibitory effect on pathogen and pest infestations. In a field trial, we compared yields, pest, and pathogen abundance in an orchard consisting of four plots, where two plots were covered with anti-hail net covers, one with plastic rain shields only, and one with plastic rain shields and exclusion netting. Pests and pathogens were assessed visually, and beating tray samples were collected to compare overall arthropod diversity between plots. We observed virtually no scab infections in both plastic rain shield plots, despite a more than 70% reduction of fungicides applied, when compared to anti-hail plots. Although no codling moth insecticides were sprayed in the plot with exclusion netting we found significantly reduced damage here, when compared to the anti-hail plots. However, likely due to microclimatic changes, we observed an increase of powdery mildew, woolly apple aphids, and spider mites under plastic rain shields. Modeling of metabolic rates of arthropod herbivores and predators revealed that there is an increased potential of herbivory under plastic rain shields. However, in terms of plant protection, the net effect of plastic rain shields and exclusion netting was a substantial reduction in chemical pesticide use, demonstrating that they represent a promising approach to minimize the use of chemical pesticides in apple production.

AB  - Genomic prediction, the technique whereby an individual's genetic component of their phenotype is estimated from its genome, has revolutionised animal and plant breeding and medical genetics. However, despite being first introduced nearly two decades ago, it has hardly been adopted by the evolutionary genetics community studying wild organisms. Here, genomic prediction is performed on eight traits in a wild population of Soay sheep. The population has been the focus of a >30 year evolutionary ecology study and there is already considerable understanding of the genetic architecture of the focal Mendelian and quantitative traits. We show that the accuracy of genomic prediction is high for all traits, but especially those with loci of large effect segregating. Five different methods are compared, and the two methods that can accommodate zero-effect and large-effect loci in the same model tend to perform best. If the accuracy of genomic prediction is similar in other wild populations, then there is a real opportunity for pedigree-free molecular quantitative genetics research to be enabled in many more wild populations; currently the literature is dominated by studies that have required decades of field data collection to generate sufficiently deep pedigrees. Finally, some of the potential applications of genomic prediction in wild populations are discussed.

AB  - The importance of animals for mediating ecosystem processes has long been recognized by ecologists. Traditionally, consumer-mediated dynamics have been considered through consumptive pathways such as predation and herbivory. Yet, consumers also play critical roles in mediating "bottom-up" pathways associated with nutrient dynamics. Foundational research demonstrated the importance of these dynamics in terrestrial, freshwater, and pelagic marine ecosystems, and introduced novel perspectives on the role of animals such as wildebeest, lacustrine fishes, and zooplankton, respectively, for providing an important source of nutrients that limit primary production. This research inspired a substantial body of research on the importance of consumer-mediated nutrient dynamics for ecosystem function. Despite this, only recently have ecologists begun to extend this line of thinking toward coastal marine ecosystems. The data presented herein is a comprehensive study of consumer nutrient dynamics from invertebrates and fishes that live in subtropical and tropical Caribbean coastal marine waters, including mangroves, seagrass beds, and coral reefs. This data set represents the largest, to my knowledge, published nutrient stoichiometry data set from a single system, including estimates of excretion rates (n = 900 individuals total; n = 667 individual fish, size range 0.14-2,597 g [2-107 cm]; n = 233 invertebrates, size range 0.04-487 g), and somatic nutrient content analyses (n = 658 individuals total, n = 494 vertebrates, n = 164 invertebrates). These data also include delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes of whole body, body mass (wet mass), taxonomic identification to class-level, and functional group classification. These data have been used to test basic ecological theory, to scale individual-level processes to coral reef, mangrove, and seagrass ecosystems, and to understand the role of human impacts for mitigating consumer-mediated nutrient dynamics. While these findings have helped improve our understanding of nutrient dynamics in tropical coastal ecosystems, these data offer a wealth of additional promise for advancing ecological theory and applied science in tropical marine ecosystems and beyond. Users are free to use and analyze the data. Attribution should be given to this presentation of the data.

AB  - Introduction: Agricultural organic waste recycling can supply nutrients for crop production and partially replace chemical nitrogen fertilizers, which is beneficial for waste management and environmental protection. Nevertheless, comprehensive evaluation of the effects of different organic materials applications on crop yield and the environment is limited. Methods: Therefore, in this study, a comprehensive investigation of the synergistic effects of straw, pig manure, and biogas residue recycling on the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) systems was carried out in the North China Plain. Field experiments were conducted from 2019 to 2021, comprising five treatments: straw (ST), pig manure (PM), and biogas residue (BR) partially replacing chemical nitrogen fertilizer, sole application of chemical nitrogen fertilizer (CF), and a control with no nitrogen application (WN). Results and discussion: The results showed that organic materials significantly increased soil total nitrogen (3.04%-9.10%) and N recovery efficiency (REN; 42.21%-44.99%), but pig manure was more beneficial in increasing crop yields (3.50%), especially wheat yields (8.72%), and REN was significantly higher than that of the other treatments. Organic materials performed differently in wheat and maize seasons, and wheat yield could be improved by organic materials return. Organic materials stimulated N2O emission in wheat season (4.28%-32.20%), while biogas residue inhibited the N2O emission in maize season (47.47%). The negative effect of straw and biogas residue on yield decreased with increasing years of return, and pig manure continued to contribute to yield. In conclusion, pig manure is the optimal alternative that can increase crop yield, soil N content, and REN without stimulating N2O emissions.

AB  - Ex-situ conservation, the transplanting of individuals outside of their natural range, can dramatically alter biotic interactions among species. Here, we explored the shifts in the herbivory pressure and defense strategies of ex-situ populations of five endangered tree species (Pterostyrax psilophyllus, Davidia involucrata, Dipteronia sinensis, Tapiscia sinensis, and Tetracentron sinense) after 20-35 years since translocation. All species were not native to the ex-situ site and only P. psilophyllus had a closely related native species (Pterostyrax corymbosus). We compared the leaf damage type, herbivory rate, and chemistry (total phenols, tannins, N, and P) of each species, and assessed the relationship between the herbivory rate and leaf chemistry between the ex-situ and wild populations. Excluding P. psilophyllus, all species in the ex-situ populations showed changes in the type of leaf damage and lower overall herbivory rates. Ex-situ populations of P. psilophyllus showed reduced total phenol, N, and P levels, while the other four species showed decreased total phenol and tannin levels, or increased N and P levels. The herbivory rate was positively correlated with the N and P levels in wild populations, and negatively correlated with the total phenol content in ex-situ populations. These differences reflect the reduced herbivory pressure, decreased defense ability, and shift in defense strategy of ex-situ populations. We showed that prolonged exposure to the ex-situ environment led to the maladaptation of these endangered plant species to herbivory pressure in the natural environment, and that these shifts should be considered in ex-situ conservation and reintroduction strategies. ? 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Large herbivores are key regulators of open habitats across the world. Free roaming ponies have a prominent ecological role in many Atlantic landscapes, where different habitats with conservation interest are linked to ponies' occurrence. The traditional management of wild ponies, which implies minimum human intervention, is declining in Galicia, NW Spain. Changes in the management regimes include the confinement of ponies in fenced areas, the use of improved pastures (IPs) and rotation between fields. Indirect effects of these changes are expected on the ecological condition of important habitats for conservation such as dry and wet heathlands and bogs. We studied social structure, spatial ecology and habitat use in 29 mares fitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars and field observations in two areas of Galicia dominated by wet heaths and blanket bogs (Xistral), and dry heaths (Sabucedo). We used spatial location and field observations to identify each band, and calculated band size, sex ratio, home range (HR) and core area size and overlap, as well as habitat use. We accounted for differences by adjusting Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for these variables as functions of management type: free roaming vs. rotation, use of IPs, fencing, and available ranging area. Larger bands were found in smaller commons, with fencing and rotation management. Home ranges, but not core area, varied as a function of the available ranging area. Band overlap was higher in fenced areas with rotation management. Increasing management may concentrate grazing pressure by reducing HRs and increasing spatial overlap between bands, which may have a long-term effect on habitat quality and conservation.

AB  - Wildlife conflicts between people and large herbivores or mammalian carnivores are widely researched in Africa, but there is limited work on human-crocodile conflicts (HCC). In Uganda, conservation efforts have enabled the recovery of the Nile Crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) population, yet the expanding human population and activities increasingly overlap with crocodile habitats resulting in negative interactions. This study used a combination of literature review, surveys, and the Nominal Group Technique to investigate the factors underpinning HCC around Murchison Falls Conservation Area. Results indicate that 115 attacks on humans occurred during 2012-2017, 84.3% of these being fatal. Also, 93.1% of the attacks occurred as victims were either fishing or collecting water. Construction of crocodile exclusion enclosures and translocation of problem crocodiles to protected areas were the most preferred mitigation measure. To reduce the prevalence of human injuries and offset local hostility toward crocodiles, conservation actors need to actively engage the affected communities.

AB  - Buffalo are country animals, with great adaptability, and thrive in diverse environments. The State of Par & aacute; has the largest herd of buffalo in Brazil, which can be found mainly on Maraj & oacute; Island in the northern region of the state. As a result, buffalo farming has become widespread in Brazil, and it offers several products to the consumer market. However, in the State of Par & aacute;, skin diseases stand out among the diseases that affect this species. This study reports the first case of dermatitis caused by Pelodera spp. in buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) on Maraj & oacute; Island, Par & aacute;. This is the first report of parasitic granulomatous dermatitis caused by Pelodera spp. in a buffalo. The affected buffalo was about seven years old, was a female of the Murrah breed and belonged to a property located on Maraj & oacute; Island in the State of Par & aacute;. During the clinical examination, the animal was in a standing position and presented several multifocal nodular and placoid masses throughout the body, mostly on the forelimbs, hindlimbs, abdomen, mammary glands, perineum, vulva and tail. These masses were also observed on the nasal mucosa, head, neck, back and chest. On macroscopic examination, the skin had several multifocal-to-coalescent sessile nodular and placoid lesions. Histopathology of the skin showed a marked reduction in the number of hair follicles. In the superficial dermis, there was significant multifocal-to-coalescent inflammatory infiltration, consisting of macrophages, epithelioid macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells and multinucleated giant cells. In the remaining hair follicles, there were numerous cross and longitudinal sections of small rhabditoid nematodes characterized by a thin cuticle, platymyarian musculature, an intestinal tract, a rhabditiform esophagus and lateral alae (morphologically compatible with Pelodera spp.). The diagnosis of parasitic dermatitis was confirmed by histopathological skin lesions associated with the presence of intralesional rhabditiform larvae morphologically compatible with Pelodera spp.

AB  - The conservation and utilization of livestock genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biodiversity and breed innovation. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 90 samples from Chinese Yangtze River Delta White goats (YRD), sourced from two populations of Chongming island white goats and Haimen white goats, aiming to dissect their genomic characteristics. In addition, 262 WGS data from nine other breeds of goats were downloaded from the NCBI database. These WGS data obtained were used to identify and analyze genetic variation with the goat reference genome, and the genetic structure of goat populations was analyzed. Through selective sweep analysis, the selection-signature genes and their polymorphic features were identified. It was found that the most significant genomic selection region in YRD goats was in the region of 62.9-64.6 Mb on chromosome 13, which contained genes related to the coat color and muscle growth of the goats. Nucleotide diversity of MYH7B, a gene related to the development of the goat's skeletal muscle, within the Yangtze River Delta white goat population was significantly lower than in other domestic and foreign goat breeds, suggesting that the gene was subject to selection. In addition, the IGF2BP2 gene, reported to be associated with litter size in goats, showed clear selection-signature characteristics in the Boer goats compared to the YRD goats.

AB  - Introduction : Actinorhizal symbioses are gaining attention due to the importance of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in sustainable agriculture. Sea buckthorn (Hippophae L.) is an important actinorhizal plant, yet research on the microbial community and nitrogen cycling in its nodules is limited. In addition, the influence of environmental differences on the microbial community of sea buckthorn nodules and whether there is a single nitrogen-fixing actinomycete species in the nodules are still unknown. Methods : We investigated the diversity, community composition, network associations and nitrogen cycling pathways of the microbial communities in the root nodule (RN), nodule surface soil (NS), and bulk soil (BS) of Mongolian sea buckthorn distributed under three distinct ecological conditions in northern China using 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing. Combined with the data of environmental factors, the effects of environmental differences on different sample types were analyzed. Results: The results showed that plants exerted a clear selective filtering effect on microbiota, resulting in a significant reduction in microbial community diversity and network complexity from BS to NS to RN. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in the microbiomes of BS and NS. While RN was primarily dominated by Actinobacteria, with Frankia sp. EAN1pec serving as the most dominant species. Correlation analysis indicated that the host determined the microbial community composition in RN, independent of the ecological and geographical environmental changes of the sea buckthorn plantations. Nitrogen cycle pathway analyses showed that RN microbial community primarily functions in nitrogen fixation, and Frankia sp. EAN1pec was a major contributor to nitrogen fixation genes in RN. Discussion: This study provides valuable insights into the effects of eco-geographical environment on the microbial communities of sea buckthorn RN. These findings further prove that the nodulation specificity and stability of sea buckthorn root and Frankia sp. EAN1pec may be the result of their long-term co-evolution.

AB  - Introduction: Fruit wings serve various ecological functions, including facilitating wind dispersal, providing physical protection to seeds, and regulating seed germination. While many studies have reported the role of fruit wings in plants, little is known about their protective function during fruit development.Methods: In this study, winged fruits damaged by insects in natural populations of three Zygophyllum species (Z. potaninii, Z. lehmannianum and Z. macropterum) were investigated. We measured and compared the percentage of damaged winged fruits, seed set, seed mass, seed germination, and seedling growth of different insect herbivory categories.Results: The results revealed that the percentage of winged fruits with damaged wings only (low predation) was significantly higher than that of with damaged both fruit wings and fruit bodies (high predation). Furthermore, winged fruits with low predation had significant higher seed set, seed mass, seed germination, and dry mass and relative growth rate (RGR) in the seedlings which grown from the seeds, than that from winged fruits with high predation.Discussion: These results demonstrate that the presence of the fruit wings may provide protection for the seeds to alleviate harm from insect predation before dispersal. These findings provide new insights into the function of fruit wings and the reproductive strategies of desert plants.

AB  - The horse-chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.), a popular ornamental tree widely cultivated throughout Europe since the 16th century, has a very limited natural range. The work presented was intended to shed light on the human-mediated spread of this species from natural Balkan populations to artificial sites. For this purpose, chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) regions were used. We sampled 670 individuals from 83 locations, including 17 natural populations and 66 artificial stands. We detected 11 haplotypes, with haplotype I dominating in the artificial range and the northern part of the species natural range, particularly in Albania and Northern Greece. This result supports historical records suggesting initial introductions from the northern part of the Pindos Mountains to Istanbul. The results also suggest potential later episodes of introduction, probably from eastern Greece. Seven haplotypes were detected only in the natural range, indicating the isolation of particular populations. Significant reduction in genetic diversity in artificial stands compared to natural ones may suggest a founder effect during its introduction. The presented work highlights the importance of preserving genetic diversity in natural horse-chestnut populations to enhance resilience against pests and diseases. It also contributes to a better understanding of the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms of tree species colonisation, which may have implications for improving conservation strategies in the face of climate change.

AB  - The seagrass Halophila stipulacea continues to spread rapidly through the Caribbean. Documenting native herbivore use of this invasive plant is important for understanding its impacts on marine communities and the mechanisms favoring its expansion. This study used observational and experimental data to determine if juvenile green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and long-spine urchins (Diadema antillarum) from the US Virgin Islands consumed H. stipulacea in the presence of native seagrass. Juvenile turtles associated significantly more with beds of native seagrass than mixed (native and invasive), and monospecific H. stipulacea, beds or sand bottoms. When individuals were followed, turtles foraged significantly more within mixed beds, but selectively fed on native species within them and were never observed feeding on monospecific H. stipulacea stands. When offered the native Thalassia testudinum and Syringodium filiforme, along with H. stipulacea, sea urchins significantly preferred S. filiforme over the other two choices. Measurements of fourteen nutritional and chemical parameters in these three seagrasses showed strong interspecific differences, with fewer and less predictable seasonal variations. Expressing these nutritional data by wet mass, rather than dry mass, also decreased the number of significant seasonal contrasts. Despite these differences, no parameters explained low herbivore preference for the invasive seagrass satisfactorily because nutrient values of H. stipulacea were often similar to those of the preferred natives. Our results conflict with recent studies pointing at low nutritional quality aiding against herbivory and suggest other mechanisms, such as herbivore learning and recognition of a novel resource, could be more important than currently appreciated.

AB  - Aim Pleistocene climatic fluctuations have been identified as a dominant factor in evolutionary and ecological processes underlying contemporary species distribution. In contrast, anthropogenic activity during the Holocene has been largely neglected in phylogeographic inference. Here, by integrating archaeological evidence, phylogeographic analyses and a climatic niche-based approach, the role of Holocene human activity in determining the evolutionary trajectory of insect pests is investigated using Hyalopterus arundiniformis (HAR) as a model. Location Eurasia. Methods We compiled archaeological records and historical data for the host plant (i.e. peach) of HAR. Phylogeographic structure, genetic diversity and gene flow were estimated. Historical demographic dynamics were explored using coalescent-based analyses. The origin and dispersal history were assessed using an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach. The changes in climatic niche breadth during geographic expansion were evaluated via niche comparison analyses. Results Our results revealed that HAR originated in Southwest China and dispersed to Southeast and Northwest China, and it was then introduced to western Eurasia from Northwest China. The climatic niche shifted significantly with range expansions, and niche expansion explained the largest proportion of niche dynamics. Population size expansion occurred in the Holocene and coincided with the domestication and trans-Eurasian trade of peach. Main conclusions The geographic range, effective population size and climatic niche breadth of HAR expanded following the human-mediated dispersal of its host plant during the Holocene. Our results highlight that the expansion of Neolithic agriculture and trans-Eurasian crop exchange along ancient communication routes may have played an important role in shaping the distribution and demographic dynamics of herbivorous insects. This study also provides essential information for pest management and biological invasions.

AB  - Simple Summary Pere David's deer is native to the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River in China. However, the wild population became extinct in China around 1900. In 1986, 39 Pere David's deer were reintroduced into Dafeng. Up until now, its wild population has reached 2658, with a total of 6119 in 2021. At present, due to the continuous increase in the population, the repeated grazing on the same plants by the Pere David's deer has affected the re-growth of plants, which has led to insufficient natural food. Therefore, feeding supplement with silage is necessary. As a key nutritional factor, diet is the most important for the gut microbiota and metabolites of wild animals. In order to determine the effect of different dietary patterns on the nutrition and health of Pere David's deer in Dafeng Reserve in spring, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of Pere David's deer feces by UPLC-MS/MS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to reveal its intestinal chemical environment and the differences in the fecal microbiome. Altogether, our data explored the significant changes in the gut microbiota and metabolic pathways during the transition from full silage to a combination diet with silage and plant in spring. These data provided important information to make more reasonable measures for Pere David's deer's protection. A deep understanding of the effect of seasonal dietary changes on the nutrition and health of Pere David's deer in Dafeng Reserve will contribute greatly to Pere David's deer's protection. In this reserve, there were three seasonal dietary regimes: feeding on naturally occurring plants (PLANT diet), silage (SILAGE diet), and a combination of natural plants and silage (COMB diet). To some extent, the COMB diet reflects the seasonal transition from silage to the all-natural plant diet, especially in early spring. However, little is known regarding the gut microbiota changes and metabolic consequences under the COMB diet. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry, the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites of Pere David's deer under these three diets were compared. Results showed the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota was significantly lower under the COMB diet compared to either the SILAGE or PLANT diets. Although no significant changes were observed in the core phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, among the three dietary regimes, a significant lower abundance of several other phyla (Spirochaetes, Melainabacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucobacteria) was observed in the COMB diet compared to the SILAGE diet. A greater number of fecal metabolite differences was identified between the COMB and SILAGE or COMB and PLANT diets than between the SILAGE and PLANT diets, suggesting that the COMB diet had more of an effect on the metabolism of Pere David's deer. The integrated pathway analysis showed that several metabolic pathways were significantly affected by the different dietary regimes, such as tryptophan metabolism, vitamin metabolism, and the platelet activation pathways. These metabolic changes reflect the responses and adaptations of Pere David's deer to different diets. Taken overall, our data reveal the difference in the gut microbiota and metabolic pathways of Pere David's deer under three dietary regimes in Dafeng Reserve, which provides important information for Pere David's deer conservation.

AB  - Cross-species communication, where signals are sent by one species and perceived by others, is one of the most intriguing types of communication that functionally links different species to form complex ecological networks. Global change and human activity can affect communication by increasing fluctuations in species composition and phenology, altering signal profiles and intensity, and introducing noise. So far, most studies on cross-species communication have focused on a few specific species isolated from ecological communities. Scaling up investigations of cross-species communication to the community level is currently hampered by a lack of conceptual and practical methodologies. Here, we propose an interdisciplinary framework based on information theory to investigate mechanisms shaping cross-species communication at the community level. We use plants and insects, the cornerstones of most ecosystems, as a showcase and focus on chemical communication as the key communication channel. We first introduce some basic concepts of information theory, then we illustrate information patterns in plant-insect chemical communication, followed by a further exploration of how to integrate information theory into ecological and evolutionary processes to form testable mechanistic hypotheses. We conclude by highlighting the importance of community-level information as a means to better understand the maintenance and workings of ecological systems, especially during rapid global change.

AB  - Understanding ecological- and management-related predictors of mammal space use within protected areas is critical for management planning. This is particularly true in small, fenced and isolated reserves where we hypothesised that management-related activities will influence large herbivore space use more than ecological characteristics. We used camera trap data to assess the space use patterns for 18 ungulate species in the small and isolated Majete Wildlife Reserve (Majete) in the understudied Miombo woodland ecoregion of southern Malawi. In the 2018 dry season, the 691 km(2) reserve was systematically surveyed for ungulate presence at 140 camera trap locations. Over a period of 5456 camera days, the survey yielded 11 078 independent detections of 18 ungulate species and three predators. Using a single-species occupancy modelling framework, the probability of space use of ungulates was assessed in relation to five management (fire exposure, fire frequency, water availability, distance from fence and road) and five ecological (visibility, grass biomass, vegetation type, terrain ruggedness and predator abundance) space use covariates, while accounting for imperfect detection. Top-ranked models contained multiple covariates for 15 of the 16 species modelled, with only nyala's (Tragelaphus angasii) space use best predicted by vegetation type only. Distance to water, vegetation type, visibility and fire frequency were predictors having strong influences on six or more species each. More management-related covariates reflected in top models, but ecological covariates had more meaningful effect sizes making us reject the hypothesis. Importantly though, distance from the roads and fence were also identified as prominent predictors. Notably, black rhinoceros' (Diceros bicornis) probability of space use increased with distance from the reserve boundary. Beyond informing habitat management for ungulates in Majete, these results can form the basis for understanding species-specific space use patterns in other small reserves with similar characteristics and threats.

AB  - Introgressive hybridization may lead to contrasting evolutionary outcomes that are difficult to predict since they depend on the fitness effects of endogenous genomic interactions and environmental factors. Conservation of endemic biodiversity may be more effective with require direct measurement of introgressed ancestry and fitness in wild populations, especially for keystone taxa at risk of hybridization following species introductions. We assessed the relationship of non-native ancestry with growth and body condition in the basin-restricted Neosho Bass ( Micropterus velox; NB), focussing on two streams in the NB native range that are admixed extensively with non-native Smallmouth Bass (M. dolomieu; SMB). We quantified the genetic composition of 116 fish from Big Sugar Creek (N = 46) and Elk River (N = 70) at 14 microsatellite loci. Using back-calculated total length-at-age estimated from sagittal otoliths, we assessed whether genetic ancestry explained variation in von Bertalanffy growth model parameters, accounting for sex and stream effects. We then assessed the relationship between ancestry and body condition. We found no differences in growth parameters by sex, stream, or ancestry, suggesting phenotypic homogenization which could be mediated by selection on body size. We found a negative correlation between SMB ancestry and condition, including lower condition in Big Sugar Creek, possibly reflecting a trade-off between maximum length and condition with respect to overall fitness. We show that ongoing non-native introgression, which may be augmented by anthropogenic SMB introductions, may attenuate evolutionary differentiation between species and directly influence fitness, possibly having critical implications for long-term persistence and management of adaptive potential in a popular and ecologically important endemic sportfish.

AB  - Extrafloral nectary plants not only occur in natural areas but also in urban parks. These areas are prone to edge effects, and plants face different microenvironmental conditions. We investigated the spatial variation of ant-plant interactions in an urban park, and we examined if plants with ants would show lower herbivory levels and if it depended on habitat type (interior or edges). Seedlings of Inga laurina were set in 200-m long transects (which covered both the west and east edges, and the interior) in an urban park and then experimentally assigned to be either ant-present or ant-excluded plants. Leaf herbivory was investigated throughout the wet season and was influenced by the interaction effect between ants and habitat type. Ants decreased the herbivory on the west edge, but on the east edge results were the opposite. The east edge had higher temperature and sunlight exposure in comparison to the other sites and was assumed to disrupt the stability of ant-plant interactions. In the interior of the fragment, herbivory depended on ant presence/absence and on the location of plants along the transect. Our study highlights how the outcomes of ant-plant interactions are spatially conditioned and affected by different types of habitats.

AB  - Over the last two decades, satellite tagging of adult and sub-adult white sharks Carcharodon carcharias off the west coast of North America has revealed a predictable onshore-offshore migratory cycle. Our current understanding of the vertical movements exhibited by white sharks while in their coastal foraging phase in the California Current, however, remains limited. Here, we used recovered datasets from 31 archival satellite tags to quantify vertical habitat use. Tags were deployed on individuals between 2000 and 2018 and recorded depth and temperature data at continuous 1-120 s intervals before being recovered up to a year after deployments. Four satellite-tagged individuals were concurrently tagged with acoustic tags, providing precise location data when detected by acoustic receivers that allowed us to explore how reported vertical habitat use varied spatially. While in the coastal shelf waters, white sharks moved at a mean depth +/- SD of 14.3 +/- 4.0 m and occupied significantly deeper depths during the day than the night. High individual, temporal and spatial variation was evident in vertical movements, while consistent diel and lunar effects emphasized the importance of light-level driving vertical behavior around hunting sites. The vertical movement behaviors reported here provide knowledge of how white sharks may directly and indirectly interact with their mammalian prey in a dynamic three-dimensional system during their capital foraging phase. Temporal patterns in vertical behavior, for instance, indicated that surface waters during early morning hours are the riskiest place for prey. Combining these novel findings with higher-resolution biologging techniques in future studies will allow us to further contextualize fine-scale vertical movement behaviors of white sharks and examine the specific foraging events that could not yet be isolated in the tagging data.

AB  - Plant-animal interactions fall within a mutualism-antagonism continuum, exerting a wide range of effects on plant reproductive success. These effects become even more complex and diverse when several disparate animal species interact with the same plant species. Despite the increasing number of studies about the influence of herbivory on plant performance, the outcomes mediated by pollination and the combined impact of multiple herbivores on pollination-specialized plants are underexplored. In this study, we chose the Mediterranean dwarf palm Chamaerops humilis (Arecaceae) to illustrate the isolated and joint effect of two contrasting introduced herbivores, the palm borer Paysandisia archon (Lepidoptera, Castniidae) and feral goats, on pollinator abundance and plant reproductive success. To this aim, we monitored moth herbivory and goat herbivory in four palm populations in Mallorca (Balearic Islands) during 2019 and 2020. The effect of herbivory varied widely depending on both the herbivore and the pollinator species. Moth herbivory had a positive effect on pollinator abundance and fruit initiation, whereas goat herbivory had a negative effect on inflorescence production, pollinator abundance and fruit initiation. In addition, both herbivores exerted unexpected nonadditive effects on palm reproduction. Palms attacked by both herbivore species produced many more inflorescences (up to 18-fold) but had a lower fruit initiation success (close to zero) than unattacked palms or those attacked by a single herbivore species. Interestingly, only one of the two main pollinator species (the nitidulid beetle Meligethinus pallidulus) was impacted by herbivory. Our study highlights the need to investigate the possible nonadditive effects of all coexisting herbivores on plant performance, especially when establishing conservation plans and pest control strategies.

AB  - Complex ecological and human-influenced factors that are characteristic of chronic wasting disease (CWD) have created substantial and unique challenges for effective management in free-ranging cervids. We sought to summarize and characterize management experiences and actions from 30 U.S. states, 4 Canadian provinces, and 3 European countries that have direct experience with CWD. We surveyed wildlife agencies that had detected CWD in their free-ranging cervid population and collected information from journal articles, published reports, and agency webpages. We report management approaches and their apparent impacts by state, provincial, or national jurisdiction during 3 stages of response to CWD: 1) pre-detection, 2) initial response, and 3) altered response. Agencies took a proactive approach to CWD during the pre-detection phase; 12 of the 24 responding agencies had a weighted-surveillance program in place and 17 had regulations aimed at disease prevention. There was no apparent difference in initial apparent prevalence of CWD among agencies with weighted surveillance in place and those without, but complicating factors, such as differing sampling methods and sample size, were present. Agencies reported 5 common surveillance strategies, and first detections were primarily from sampling hunter-harvested deer. Bans or restrictions on interstate movement of carcasses or live animals and increased bag limits were common responses to the detection of CWD and were used by 83% and 78% of the 24 responding agencies, respectively. Similarly, adapted surveillance was a common response to CWD detection; 14 of the 24 agencies either initiated or adjusted their weighted surveillance program following detection. However, of the 20 U.S. states and 6 Canadian provinces that have not yet detected CWD, only 3 are currently applying weighted surveillance approaches to their CWD sampling efforts. As demonstrated by New York and Minnesota, localized eradication of CWD may be possible if it is detected in its emergent stage when there are few infected deer in an area. We found that 4 of the 20 U.S. states and 2 of the 6 Canadian provinces that have yet to detect CWD had a response plan available online. Further analyses to assess the impacts of various management approaches on the spatial and temporal trajectory of CWD prevalence requires more data collection and reporting, such as consistent and fine-scale surveillance in management and control areas. We recommend that agencies be proactive in public messaging of CWD response plans well before initial detection and that cervid managers dealing with CWD collaborate regularly with one another to share their variable and collective experiences. We also recommend that agencies provide detailed public reports on CWD responses, disease progression, and management outcomes.

AB  - The increasing frequency of wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) is a globally recognized problem that can severely impact both the animals and humans involved in these accidents. Introduced wild pigs (Sus scrofa) have been present in various parts of the USA for centuries, but no study on wild pig-vehicle collisions (WPVCs) has been conducted on a national scale for the USA Using data provided by State Farm, we derived the number of vehicle collisions with wild pigs by state in the USA over the 2015-2022 period and the associated vehicle damage costs. In 2022, we estimated that a total of 16,714 wild pig-vehicle collisions occurred, which necessitated $103.8 million in vehicle repair costs. Texas bore the highest burden ($56.2 million), followed by Florida ($12.4 million). We showed that the ratio of collisions with wild pigs to vehicle miles traveled increased with state-level wild pig density and that this ratio is more than seven times higher in Hawaii and Texas than could be expected based solely on the local wild pig densities. Compared to other WVCs, only 1.64% of these accidents were caused by WPVCs. Nationally, WPVCs caused 0.18% of the annual attrition in wild pig populations. WPVCs impose a substantial financial burden to the USA that is unlikely to decrease in the immediate future. WPVC risks are driven by state-specific effects indicating the presence of strong influencing factors at the individual state level. It is thus imperative that transportation and wildlife managers adequately study the issue and collect the data required for mitigation.

AB  - Submerged macrophytes are vital in shallow lakes, as they provide critical ecosystem functions and services and can stabilize the clear-water conditions by various mechanisms. Nutrient enrichment reduces the resilience of macrophyte dominance in shallow lakes, thereby making them susceptible to shifts towards phytoplankton dominance following perturbations. Here, we conducted a mesocosm experiment to examine the individual and combined effects of nutrient enrichment and the addition of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) on the abundance of submerged macrophytes, epiphyton, and phytoplankton. We hypothesized that moderate nutrient enrichment facilitates macrophyte abundance, but also phytoplankton abundance after macrophyte removal by herbivorous fish. Our data showed that herbivory by grass carp could trigger a shift from macrophytes to algal dominance in mesocosms with moderate nutrient concentrations, but not in those with low nutrient concentrations. Moderate nutrient enrichment alone promoted submerged macrophyte growth, whereas the introduction of grass carp induced a collapse of submerged macrophytes regardless of nutrient conditions. Moreover, the introduction of grass carp showed more negative effects on light conditions of the water column in mesocosms with moderate nutrient concentrations compared to those with low nutrient concentrations. A recovery of submerged macrophytes might thus be limited by low light availability in lakes with moderate nutrient conditions suffering grass carp perturbation. Our results suggest that submerged macrophyte-dominated shallow lakes with moderate nutrient conditions are vulnerable to perturbation by herbivorous fish such as grass carp. In turn, managing the abundance of herbivores in these lakes can support the dominance of macrophytes and associated clear water conditions.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Fritillaria meleagris L. (Snake's Head Fritillary). The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of Britain and Ireland: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. Fritillaria meleagris is a perennial spring bulb that grows in wet mesotrophic meadows and wet openings in woodlands. In Britain, it is localised to floodplain meadows but occurs as an intentional introduction in a range of habitats. There are several large populations on the floodplains of the River Thames and its tributaries in Wiltshire, Berkshire and Oxfordshire. Fritillaria meleagris occurs on mesotrophic alluvium soils often overlaying calcareous gravel with a relatively wide pH range. It favours a high ground water table during winter months and spring followed by good drainage of the soil throughout the summer. Fritillaria meleagris plants regularly experience prolonged dormancy. From 30% to 99% of plants in a population can remain below-ground for more than a year. Fritillaria meleagris produces nectar and is mainly pollinated in April by bumblebee queens in England. Other pollinators include insects of the orders Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera, particularly bumblebees, hoverflies and butterflies. The release of the seeds from the pod in May-June can take a month. Seeds require warm and cold treatments for the embryo to fully form. Air pockets aid seed flotation on the surface of flood water for up to a month. The seeds of Fritillaria meleagris do not form a seed bank, germinating either during flotation or on bare ground. Fritillaria meleagris declined in Britain during the 20th century due to agricultural improvement and ploughing of floodplain grasslands. In all, 20 or so remaining populations survive in ancient hay meadows. Several of its British locations receive statutory protection as designated sites. However, recent work suggests that F. meleagris was probably introduced to Britain as an ornamental, and the level of protection it receives is therefore likely to change.

AB  - Simple Summary Forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) is a species that is currently classified as endangered and found in China and Vietnam. In order to prevent their extinction, China initiated captive breeding programs in the 1950s. Maintaining the high genetic diversity of the population is a crucial factor for ensuring the sustainable and rapid growth of these captive populations. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) possesses a unique lineage of matrilineal evolution, and the control region (CR) is considered to be one of the most popular molecular markers for conducting a genetic diversity analysis and determining maternal lines. In this study, we assessed the current genetic diversity status of 338 individuals from seven captive forest musk deer populations located in the Shaanxi province using mtDNA CR, and the results showed that the genetic diversity was high. We also made full use of previous mtDNA CR data clearly defining 65 haplotypes with their frequency and concluded with about 90 maternal lines. The analysis revealed no significant genetic differentiation among the populations, and the populations might not have experienced rapid population expansion. The current study represents the most comprehensive research of genetic diversity of captive forest musk deer to date, and will be helpful to preserve and enhance the genetic diversity of the captive forest musk deer populations. Forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) are endangered ruminants whose adult males secrete musk. China has been breeding forest musk deer artificially since the 1950s in an effort to restore wild populations, with Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces as the two main sites for captive breeding. Genetic diversity is a significant indicator that determines the long-term viability and status of a population, particularly for species at risk of extinction. In this study, we analyzed the current genetic makeup of seven captive forest musk deer populations in the Shaanxi province, using the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (CR) as the molecular marker. We sequenced 604 bp of mtDNA CR, with an average content of A+T higher than G+C. We observed 111 variable sites and 39 different haplotypes from 338 sequences. The nucleotide diversity (Pi) and haplotype diversity (Hd) were 0.02887 and 0.908, respectively. Genetic differentiation between these populations was not significant, and the populations might not have experienced rapid growth. By combining our sequences with previous ones, we identified 65 unique haplotypes with 26 rare haplotypes and estimated a total of 90 haplotypes in Shaanxi province captive populations. The Shaanxi province and Sichuan province obtained 88 haplotypes, the haplotypes from the two populations were mixed together, and the two populations showed moderate genetic differentiation. Our findings suggested that captive forest musk deer populations in the Shaanxi province had high genetic diversity, with a rich founder population of about 90 maternal lines. Additionally, managers could develop genetic management plans for forest musk deer based on the haplotype database. Overall, our study will provide insights and guidelines for the conservation of genetic diversity in captive forest musk deer populations in the Shaanxi province.

AB  - Developing successful conservation programs for genetically depleted species is challenging. Survival and adaptive potential are related to genetic and habitat factors; therefore, conservation programs are designed to minimize risks associated with inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity. The greater mouse-deer (Tragulus napu) is a true forest species that contributes to seed distribution dynamics in forests. However, with continuous demographic decline over the last century in the wild, only captive populations of the greater mouse-deer remain on the Thai mainland. A restoration program initiated 20 years ago has increased their population to more than 100 individuals but maintaining high genetic diversity in a small captive population is crucial for successful recovery. Microsatellite genotyping and mitochondrial D-loop and SRY gene sequence analyses were performed to examine the genetic diversity and population structure in 123 greater mouse-deer (64 females and 59 males). Highly reduced effective captive population size with trends of inbreeding were observed. No historical bottleneck was observed. These conditions have reduced their reproductive fitness and ability to adapt to environmental change, increasing the risk of population decline and eventual extinction. Demographic analyses suggested a recent captive population expansion due to effective animal welfare and reproduction. The results also suggested that population size at equilibrium is the main factor of allelic diversity (number of alleles). Large habitat carrying capacity, representing each fixed captive population size can support the genetic diversity of greater mouse-deer. We also identified suitable habitat areas for reintroduction and long-term in situ conservation of greater mouse-deer using maximum entropy modeling. Based on the environmental variables, species distribution modeling for greater mouse-deer indicated lowland tropical forest regions in the Khlong Saeng-Khao Sok forest complexes as most suitable and requiring urgent habitat improvement. These findings highlight the relevance of careful genetic monitoring and habitat suitability for the long-term conservation of greater mouse-deer and enhance the success of future conservation plans.

AB  - Context. Good body condition in juvenile marine mammals is crucial for survival and, therefore, population demography. Australian fur seals, endemic to Australia, recently established a breeding colony at the southern edge of their range, at The Needles, a small group of islands in south -west Tasmania (43.6614 degrees S) and a significant distance from their core breeding range in Bass Strait. Aims. We aimed to compare pup body condition at two breeding colonies, distinct in time since establishment and latitude. Specific aims were to: (1) establish the timing of peak pupping, to compare condition of known-age pups, and determine a baseline at The Needles; (2) investigate pup body condition over time at an established colony; and (3) gain insight into the effects of environmental conditions on pup body condition. Methods. We conducted a colony comparison of pup body condition using condition indices at The Needles and an established breeding colony in Bass Strait, Tenth Island, for the 2019/20 and 2020/21 breeding seasons. Pup body condition was quantified at Tenth Island over 18 years (2003-2020) using a long-term morphometric dataset. To establish breeding phenology at these two colonies, we determined peak pupping date for the 2019/20 breeding season using daily pup counts. We assessed the effect of environmental parameters on body condition for the long-term dataset. Key results. Pups from The Needles displayed significantly higher body condition than those from Tenth Island, despite similar peak pupping date. Breeding phenology was consistent with published timing for Australian fur seals. Pup body condition at Tenth Island over the 2-year colony comparison was comparable to the historical average. Environmental drivers that affect maternal foraging efficiency are linked to pup body condition. Conclusions. Higher pup body condition at The Needles is likely underpinned by better foraging conditions resulting in increased pup provisioning levels. Our results indicate that south-west Tasmania is a region of foraging and emerging breeding importance for Australian fur seals. Implications. Future research to monitor pup body condition, maternal foraging behaviour and ecosystem productivity at The Needles will help to provide greater understanding of likely population trajectories at this southernmost breeding site for Australian fur seals.

AB  - Leaf resource allocation plays a significant role in the evolution of plant functional strategies, where tradeoffs between defense, structure, and different components of photosynthesis drive the partitioning of carbon and nitrogen. One hypothesized but underexplored mechanism of the success of many invasive species in competition with natives is reallocation of resources toward higher photosynthetic capacity, assuming they experience reduced pest consumption in their invaded ('away') range. We examined leaf function and chemistry in the context of carbon and nitrogen (N) budgets in home- (Japan) and away-range (France and USA) populations of the global invader, Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica (Houtt.) var. japonica). In 38 field populations, we measured photosynthetic CO2 (A-Ci) response curves and quantified the proportion of leaf N allocated to separate photosynthetic processes, including carboxylation (Rubisco content), light harvesting, and the electron transport chain, plus the amount of N allocated to cell structure (cell wall protein) and defense (total alkaloids, cyanogenic glycosides). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found significantly higher leaf N allocation to photosynthesis in both away range populations, particularly Rubisco content, along with higher total leaf N in USA populations. However, neither maximum carboxylation capacity nor light-saturated photosynthetic rates were greater in the away ranges, nor did we find reduced allocation to leaf structure (cell wall protein). Further, USA populations had significantly greater concentrations of defensive cyanogenic glycosides, where some native-range herbivores have unintentionally been introduced. Our study suggests that away-range changes in invader leaf function may be more complex than a simple expectation based on photosynthetic capacity.

AB  - Natural corridors are essential components of wildlife conservation but, when human-wildlife conflicts emerge, the participation of local communities becomes imperative to ensure their efficacy and long-term persistence. Therefore, local people initiatives and commitments (community-based strategies) promoting human-wildlife coexistence are urgently needed especially in African natural corridors dominated by elephants (Loxodonta africana). Wildlife rangers represent skilled technical staff who are involved in the monitoring and protection of wildlife but also in promoting human-wildlife coexistence and community awareness. They are the closest conservation staff to local communities and have broad experience in dealing with elephants around the villages. Therefore, collecting and recognizing the knowledge of wildlife rangers on the suitability of possible local solutions could contribute to the successful planning and implementation of human elephant mitigation measures at farmer level. This study aims to quantify wildlife rangers' preferences for community-based strategies to increase human-elephant coexistence in the Selous-Niassa Wildlife Corridor (Southern Tanzania). In particular, we evaluated wildlife rangers' preferences regarding three attributes: local farm-based mitigation measures, the implication of technical support in the implementation of those measures and the preferred level of cooperation in the local community for that implementation. In 2019, we conducted a discrete choice experiment by interviewing 63 wildlife rangers (41% of the total rangers working along the corridor). Results showed that the most preferred management strategy included building chili-oil fences by farmers cooperating at community level and technically supported by external institutions. Other strategies considered were (in decreasing order of importance) crop species selection, beehive fences, crop translocation, cooperation in small groups, and the use of noisemakers. The discrete choice analysis of wildlife rangers' preferences, including the type and level of cooperation, allows quantifying the suitability of different management strategies for mitigating human-wildlife coexistence challenges.

AB  - Teeth root morphology and integrity are essential to provide appropriate attachment, allowing for continuous and functional movement, with implications for adequate food processing, animal performance, and longevity. We studied the occurrence of supernumerary roots in mandibular molariform teeth of red deer (Cervus elaphus Linnaeus, 1758) from seven separate populations spanning a range of latitudes in the Iberian Peninsula. We analyzed the influence of several factors, including sex, origin (native vs. reintroduced), lineage, and habitat, to assess extra root prevalence variations. The highest prevalence in deciduous teeth was found in pm(3) (14%) and in permanent teeth in M1 (3%). We found significant differences between areas, lineages, and soil type; however, no significant relationships were found with the origin or the sex of individuals. We speculate that the high prevalence of supernumerary roots in M1 might be related to increased wear in grazers. Furthermore, we suggest that this high prevalence in deciduous teeth might be associated with a hard diet, dry climatic conditions, and a harsh weaning period, which indicate that supernumerary roots might have an adaptive value.

AB  - Invasive plants are often attacked by both introduced specialist and native generalist natural enemies in new ranges. Soil fertility can potentially alter the interactions of these natural enemies with native versus invasive plants in ways that have largely unexplored implications for biological invasions and biological control. A common garden experiment was conducted to compare the performance of an introduced specialist flea beetle, Agasicles hygrophila, and/or a native generalist nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, on invasive alligator weed, Alternanthera philoxeroides, and its native congener sessile joyweed, Alternanthera sessilis, under different levels of soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). At a relatively low or moderate N and P levels, the flea beetle and the nematodes were not significantly affected by each other. Under these conditions, alligator weed responded plastically by producing more branches and biomass, as well as longer stolons, in response to attack by the flea beetle and/or the nematode, compared to sessile joyweed responses to similar levels of damage. However, under a relatively high N and P levels, nematode infestations significantly reduced flea beetle damage on alligator weed, resulting in significantly greater above- and below-ground biomass and longer stolons than plants without herbivory. In contrast, beetle herbivory significantly increased the level of nematode infestations on sessile joyweed, resulting in significantly fewer fine and coarse roots, and lower above- and below-ground biomass compared to plants without herbivory. Synthesis and applications. Our findings illustrate the importance of soil fertility in mediating interactions between specialist biocontrol agents and native generalists on native versus invasive plants. High phenotypic plasticity seems to be an important attribute that contributes to the success of invasive plants like alligator weed in relatively nutrient-poor environments. However, nutrient-rich environments could potentially confer greater growth benefits on invasive plants than on native ones by changing herbivore-herbivore interactions on plants differently. There is a great need to fully investigate the direct and indirect interactions between biocontrol agents and generalists across food webs following classical biocontrol releases. Nutrient measurements of both soil and water bodies should also be incorporated into all stages of biocontrol programmes.

AB  - Over the past 100 years, the biodiversity of our planet has declined dramatically. To date, more than 142 500 species of animals have been included in the Red List of The World Conservation Union and about 40 000 of them are threatened with extinction (The IUCN horizontal ellipsis , 2022). Red Data Books of various levels are documents that keep records of rare and endangered species with an indication of their past and present distribution, reproduction features, and protection measures already taken and those necessary in the future. They act as a formal legal basis for the establishment of a special regime of protection in relation to these objects. The new edition of the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation (2021) includes four species of ungulates that are significant in the biocenoses of steppes and deserts. Two of them are no longer found in the wild in Russia: Przewalski's horse (Equus przewalskii Poljakov, 1881) is extinct in Russia since the 19th century and the onager (Equus hemionus Pallas, 1775) since the beginning of the 20th century. The state of populations of other two species, the saiga (Saiga tatarica Linnaeus, 1766) and the Mongolian gazelle or the dzeren (Procapra gutturosa Pallas, 1777), causes serious concern. The loss of members of this group from the ecosystems will not only reduce the biodiversity of arid biomes, but may also lead to their degradation. The last time the onager was seen on the territory of Russia in Transbaikalia was in 1926. For almost 20 years there have been discussions about its reintroduction in Dauria and the Northwestern Caspian region, however, the lack of a full-scale scientific research may make this initiative to be risky in all aspects. The northern boundary of the Mongolian gazelle range passes the territory of Russia. However, the number and state of its population in Russia largely depends on the state of its population in the territory of Mongolia. After the complete disappearance of the species in the 1970s-1980s in Altai, Tuva, and Transbaikalia, dzeren population began to recover in the 1990s, due to the increase of its North-Kerulen population in Mongolia: resuming of winter migrations to the territory of Southeastern Transbaikalia, favorable natural conditions, and effective protection of the species on the territories of two nature biosphere reserves, Daursky and Sokhondo, and the federal zakaznik (nature refuge) Dzeren Valley, contributed to the formation of a number of sedentary groups of these ungulates (Kirilyuk and Lushchekina, 2017). Now, the total number of the species in Russia is about 20 000 individuals (Kirilyuk, 2021). It is the first time for the saiga to be listed in the Red Data Book. In the 1980s, its numbers did not cause any concern: the species amounted to about 400 000 individuals. However, overhunting, intensive development of agriculture, reduction of suitable habitats, the economic crisis in the country, poaching, and temporary suspension of the nature protection activities led to a sharp decrease in the saiga population in the Northwestern Caspian region. In 2015 the population number was only 4000-5000 individuals (Karimova and Lushchekina, 2018). Until relatively recently, all three species were considered commercial. However, environmentally unfriendly forms of economic development of arid territories (plowing and land reclamation, overgrazing, construction of roads and other technical structures without taking into account regional features, etc.
   ) directly or indirectly contributed to the reduction of the ranges of the species and disruption of their seasonal migrations and spatial structure. All these resulted in population decrease, increasing their vulnerability to abnormal weather conditions (heavy snowfall, droughts, fires, etc.) and the pressure of legal and illegal hunting. The future of these unique animals depends, first of all, on man and his (our) attitude to the natural environment. Their well being should be facilitated by the implementation of measures developed by specialists and listed both in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation and in approved specific strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary Classical swine fever is a highly contagious disease that infects both domestic pigs and wild boars. Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) has not been detected in domestic pigs in South Korea since 2016, but has been increasing in wild boars since 2017. Two cases of CSFV subgenotype 2.1d were detected in wild Korean boars in 2011, but then no cases were detected until 2016; however, 16 cases of CSFV were detected between 2017 and 2019. In this study, we report seven CSFV-positive samples obtained from wild boars in 2020. In addition, although 13 mtDNA haplotypes were detected in wild boars in South Korea, all 25 cases of CSFV that occurred in wild boars between 2011 and 2020 were detected in animals with haplotype 01. Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is one of the major pathogens that causes severe economic damage to the swine industry. Circulation of CSFV in wild boars carries the potential risk of reintroducing the virus into CSFV-free pig farms. This study carried out a genetic analysis of CSFV isolates from wild boars and analyzed the mtDNA haplotypes of the wild boars. Blood samples (n = 2140) from wild Korean boars captured in 2020 were subjected to qRT-PCR to detect CSFV, which was classified as subgenotype 2.1d based on phylogenetic analysis. CSFV had been detected in wild boars only in northern regions (Gangwon and Gyeonggi) of South Korea between 2011 and 2019. However, CSFV was identified in wild boars in the more southern regions (Chungbuk and Gyeongbuk) in 2020. Based on mitochondrial DNA analysis, all wild boars with CSFV were haplotype 01 (H01). Thus, we presume that the H01 haplotype is more susceptible to CSFV. In the future, infection of wild boars by CSFV is expected to occur intermittently every year, and we predict that most wild boars infected with CSFV will be haplotype H01.

AB  - Introduction Parental environments can influence offspring fitness via clonal (asexual) propagation, and such clonal parental effects may vary among plant species and depend on offspring environments as well. Consequently, clonal parental effects may alter competitive interactions between plant species, and such impacts may vary with offspring environments.Methods We conducted a two-phase experiment with two clonal floating duckweeds, Spirodela polyrhiza and Lemna minor. In the parental phase, S. polyrhiza and L. minor were grown separately under two distinct nutrient conditions and produced offspring ramets. In the offspring phase, the ramets produced from the parental phase were grown with or without a heterospecific neighbor under the same two nutrient conditions.Results and discussion In the first phase, parent ramets of both species produced more biomass and offspring ramets under high nutrient availability than under low. In the second phase, nutrient availability experienced by the parents significantly affected the competitive ability of offspring in both species. Specifically, the offspring of L. minor suppressed those of S. polyrhiza more strongly when the parent of L. minor had been grown under high than low nutrient availability, although such clonal parental effects did not vary with nutrient availability experienced by the offspring. In contrast, the offspring of S. polyrhiza suppressed those of L. minor more strongly when the parent of S. polyrhiza had been grown under high rather than at low nutrient availability, but this effect occurred only under high nutrient availability for the offspring and diminished under low nutrient availability. These results suggest that clonal parental effects can influence competitiveness of plants and may vary depending on offspring environments. Our findings highlight the potential role of clonal parental effects in regulating interspecific interactions, which may further influence species composition and productivity of plant communities.

AB  - The environmental impacts of farming are central in sustainable food system discussions, as current practices often harm soils, water, biodiversity, and ecosystem health. Carbon farming has emerged as a promising strategy, improving soil health, increasing organic carbon, and supporting profitability. However, Life Cycle Assessment has limitations in capturing agriculture's multifunctional roles, prompting the integration of socio-economic analyses. This study uses Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) methods to assess the environmental, economic, and social aspects of Conservation Agriculture, specifically testing camelina [Camelina Sativa (L.) Crantz] as a cashcover crop in Mediterranean dryland systems. Across eight case studies, findings suggest that conservation practices and camelina introduction can enhance biodiversity, soil health, and farmer incomes, while reducing environmental costs and creating sustainable market opportunities for oilseeds. Despite potential trade-offs, such as increased input costs and nitrous oxide emissions, policy recommendations are provided to support sustainable practices, with LCT frameworks guiding resilience in Mediterranean agriculture.

AB  - Predation by feral cats (Felis catus) has caused the extinction of many native species in Australia and globally. There is growing evidence that the impacts of feral cats can be amplified in post-fire environments, as cats are drawn to hunt in or around recently burnt areas and are also more effective hunters in open habitats. In 2018-2019, we established arrays of camera traps to estimate the abundance of feral cats on Kangaroo Island, South Australia. Much of the island (including five of our seven survey sites) was subsequently burnt in a severe wildfire (December 2019-February 2020). We re-sampled the sites 3-8 months post-fire (seven sites) and 11-12 months post-fire (three sites). At two unburnt sites sampled post-fire, it was possible to produce density estimates of cats using a spatially explicit capture-recapture approach. Where estimating density was not possible (due to low detections or individual cats not being distinguishable), the number of individuals and percentage of trap nights with detections was compared between the sampling periods. Some low-level cat control occurred within 2 km of three of the seven arrays (all within the burn scar) within 3 months of the fire. Across the five burnt sites, there was a decline in cat detections post-fire (including those without post-fire cat control). At 3-8 months post-fire, there was, on average, a 57% reduction in the number of individual cats, and a 65% reduction in the number of nights with cat detections, relative to pre-fire levels. Although cat detections declined following the fire, reduced population sizes of prey species and reduced cover as a result of the fire might still mean that cat predation is a threat to some surviving prey species. Management that reduces feral cat predation pressure on wildlife following wildfire should enhance the likelihood of post-fire wildlife persistence and recovery.

AB  - Non-native deer populations are increasing in many parts of the world. Recreational hunting has commonly been advocated as a method for reducing deer population densities on private land, but there have been few robust evaluations of its effectiveness. We quantified the impacts of recreational hunting on a population of non-native fallow deer (Dama dama) on a private conservation reserve in Tasmania, Australia. We used a grid of 64 motion-sensitive cameras to estimate seasonal deer population density for three consecutive years. Recreational hunters recorded their hunting effort (date and duration of hunts), deer seen, and deer killed, and used a GPS to record where they hunted. Throughout the three-year period, deer density remained between 3.95 and 4.96 deer per km2, well above the mean 2.7 deer per km2 estimated for Tasmania. The 28 hunters killed a total of 128 deer (33 males, 87 females and 8 unknown) during 306 hunts. The annual harvest comprised 21%-26% of the total deer population (28%-38% of the female population). During the four-week 'buck' season (March), hunters exhibited more selective hunting behaviour characterised by frequent hunts that targeted mostly antlered males with low catch per unit effort (0.03 deer killed per hour). In contrast, the 8-month antlerless season (March-November) was characterised by a more opportunistic hunting behaviour with fewer hunts and a higher catch per unit effort (0.11 deer killed per hour). Our results show that the current regime of recreational hunting is not reducing the population. If landowners decide to rely on recreational hunting to reduce deer densities on their properties, more deer, especially females, need to be harvested annually. Changes to regulations that increase the number of deer harvested should be considered in parallel with greater incentives for recreational hunters to harvest more females. Other deer control methods, such as helicopter-based shooting and professional ground-based shooting, are likely to provide faster and greater reductions in the densities of non-native deer populations than recreational hunting while non-lethal management should be considered for local asset protection.

AB  - A 30-year time series of the recruitment of rabbit fish, a herbivorous coral reef fish, on the island of Guam in the tropical western Pacific, showed variability that ENSO alone does not explain. To help explain this variability, a high-resolution biophysical model that includes directional swimming reveals how mesoscale turbulence and ENSO-driven changes in the ocean circulation control the self-recruitment of rabbit fish. ENSO drives island wakes that enhance the capacity to retain locally spawned larvae, and mesoscale turbulence generates much variability and promotes seaward dispersion at time scales larger than the Pelagic Larval Duration. The same processes are predicted to occur for the self-recruitment of grouper fish, a carnivorous coral reef fish, in Palau, Micronesia. The models suggests that 99% of these fish larvae are exported seaward from Guam and Palau. Those larvae are the ones that could provide connectivity between reefs and islands in Micronesia. This connectivity for the grouper fish was predicted using an altimetry-driven advection-diffusion oceanography model for 40 mass spawning events spread over 10 years. The mesoscale turbulence, and not the mean oceanographic currents, is the dominant process controlling the connectivity, which is thus chaotic. This finding applies also in the Galapagos archipelago and the Coral Sea fringing the Great Barrier Reef.

AB  - Introduced seaweeds can alter the structure and productivity of marine food webs, especially when they lack top-down control by native herbivores. However, relatively little is known about the role of consumption of introduced seaweeds by native herbivores, and the potential role of seaweed nutrient content to mediate local herbivore consumption. In southeastern USA estuaries, the introduced red seaweed, Gracilaria vermiculophylla, has transformed unvegetated intertidal mudflats into a patchwork of non-native seaweed beds. We used a series of laboratory feeding assays to assess how invertebrate and fish species on the Georgia coast utilize G. vermiculophylla as a novel food resource. Because G. vermiculophylla readily absorbs nutrients, we also tested the role of nutrient enrichment on its consumption. We found that G. vermiculophylla was not significantly consumed by the mud snail Ilyanassa obsoleta nor the mud crab Eurypanopeus despressus, but it was rapidly eaten and even preferred over the native seaweed Ulva lactuca by adult pinfish Lagodon rhomboides. Nutrient enrichment of G. vermiculophylla did not affect consumption rates by the amphipod Ampithoe valida, but did double consumption rates by pinfish over unenriched seaweed. The differential responses of native consumers highlight the importance of evaluating multiple species when investigating introduced species' impacts on recipient communities. Given that consumer identity and nutrient content of the seaweed mediated the consumption of the non-native seaweed, site-specific patterns of consumer populations and environmental conditions could lead to patchy abundance and impacts of the non-native seaweed.

AB  - Improving connectivity is the most commonly used approach employed in biodiversity conservation to mitigate habitat fragmentation. Graph-based networks relying on species-oriented definitions of nodes and edges are powerful tools for evaluating landscape connectivity. However, few studies have examined the effects of seasonal variation and uncertainty in parameterization of habitat suitability on the identification of priority sites. Here, a combination of the habitat suitability index, morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), and graph-network analysis were combined to assess the influence of habitat variability on the identification of priority sites for reintroduction of South China tiger (Panthera tigris amoyensis). The combined approach was applied to the Hupingshan and Houhe National Nature Reserve and neighbourhood that are considered the most suitable places to harbour small populations of South China tigers. Six spatial or temporally static assessment scenarios for habitat suitability were used to account for uncertainties in the habitat requirement parameterizations of wild boars as the main prey for South China tigers. For each assessment scenario, three classification schemes (i.e., the P50, P70, and P90 schemes) were adopted to explain uncertainties in priority sites evaluation. In the static scenario, the minimum area of priority sites in the P50, P70, and P90 schemes was 321, 354, and 2,371 km2, respectively, while the areas encompassed by priority sites in the P50, P70, and P90 schemes considering the seasonal variability and habitat uncertainty were 0.2, 1.6, and 229.5 km2, respectively. These results suggest that priority areas with high conservation value differed among the six assessment scenarios. Conservation planning of landscapes consequently should consider the impacts of changes in landscape structures caused by seasonal variation and uncertainty in the parameterization of habitat suitability for the assessment of landscape priority sites rather than relying on purely spatial or temporally static connectivity analyses.

AB  - Context. Little is known about wildlife harvesting by licensed recreational hunters in Australia, where both native and introduced species are hunted. It is important to understand harvest trends to assess sustainability for native species and implications for population control of introduced species. Aim. The aim of this study was to analyse trends in hunter participation, activity and efficiency, and wildlife harvest, including effects of climate, in Victoria, Australia, for three game species groups: introduced deer, native waterfowl (ducks) and one native grassland species, stubble quail (Coturnix pectoralis). Methods. Telephone surveys of a random sample of licenced Victorian hunters were performed annually from 2009 to 2019. Hunters were asked to quantify their hunting effort and the number of animals harvested. The respondents' answers were analysed to estimate measures of hunter success, activity and efficiency. Bayesian modelling was applied to these data, accounting for changes over time, differences between survey periods for all licence types, and random effects for over-dispersion. The effect of climate on game bird hunter activity and harvest was estimated, as measured by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Results. Over 11 years, annual deer harvest (all species) increased exponentially, at a mean annual rate of 17% (95% credible interval: 14-21%), and the number of deer hunters increased at 8% (5-11%). In contrast, for ducks and stubble quail, hunter numbers remained relatively unchanged, with no evidence of consistent change to total harvests over time, unrelated to changes in environmental conditions or regulations. The annual duck harvest was influenced by ENSO and hunting regulations. The annual stubble quail harvest exhibited 'boom-and-bust' dynamics, with an exceptionally large harvest immediately after a La Nina season. Conclusions. Long-term monitoring of harvest trends in south-eastern Australia revealed stark differences between introduced deer and native birds: harvest of deer increased rapidly whereas equivalent rates for game birds were either stable or declining. Seasonal effects had a strong influence on game bird harvest. Environmental and regulatory conditions were influential for harvest outcomes for ducks and stubble quail. Implications. This study filled a key knowledge gap around managing harvesting of game species, but increased scrutiny is warranted in this field.

AB  - Escaping from predators is fundamental for the survival of any prey species. Australian fauna within the 'critical weight range' (CWR; 35 g-5.5 kg) are vulnerable to introduced eutherian predators. The absence of co-evolution between native marsupials and these novel predators may suggest that their antipredator behaviour towards the hunting strategies of these predators is inappropriate or ineffective. We quantified the escape behaviour of eight CWR marsupial taxa (three quadrupedal bandicoots and five bipedal macropods) to determine if differences in how they escape from predators indicate their ability to respond appropriately and effectively to introduced predators. Animals were filmed escaping through a runway and 20 measures relating to their gait, speed and path characteristics were recorded. These were reduced to four dimensions using multidimensional scaling (MDS): MDS1 linear speed versus agility, MDS2 acceleration style, MDS3 reactivity and MDS4 gait characteristics. We found a strong link between the phylogenetic relatedness of species and their use of linear speed or agility when fleeing (phylogenetic heritability, h(2) = 0.96). Bipedal macropod species used straight-line, fast escapes, which may be suited to escape pursuit predators. The quadrupedal bandicoots had an overall slower escape but were more likely to use sudden changes of direction, which can be successful if pursued by a larger, less mobile predator or where there is sufficient vegetation cover to obstruct pursuit. Repeated exposure increased linear speed (MDS1) and hastened the timing of acceleration (MDS2). The phylogenetic signal for escape speed/straightness suggests specific escape tactics may be constrained by morphology, although animals increased the intensity of their response after repeated exposure, suggesting training could enhance effective antipredator responses.

AB  - The thermal environment is important in unit production because the perception of thermal stress can reduce fertility, and productive performance, therefore its management is necessary. The use of non-invasive methods, such as infrared thermography and real-time ultrasonography, are widely used to evaluate indicators in animal production, without the need to slaughter the animals. Thus, we aimed to assess the effect of the thermal environment on the physiological parameters and carcass characteristics of Dorper sheep with positive and negative residual feed intake (RFI) using infrared thermography and real-time ultrasonography techniques. Twenty uncastrated male Dorper sheep (17.8 +/- 2.4 kg) were confined for 40 days for RFI classification. Sheep were separated into positive RFI (n = 10) and negative RFI (n = 10). The experimental design was in randomized blocks, in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, with 2 thermal environments (full sun or shade) and two feed efficiency groups (positive RFI or negative RFI), with 5 replications. The sheep remained in confinement for 60 days. The animals were slaughtered at the end of the experiment and the carcasses dissected for tissue separation. Rectal temperature (RT) and respiratory rate (RR) were measured at two times (14:00 h and 18:00 h) for periods of 5 days. The RR was determined by indirect auscultation of heart sounds at the level of the laryngotracheal region. The RT was measured introduced a digital clinical thermometer into the animal's rectum. Surface temperature (ST) was obtained using a thermographic infrared camera, collecting the temperatures of the eyeball and skin surface in the regions of the head, ribs, rump, flank and shin. Sheep confined in full sun showed higher RR (P = 0.0001), ST ribs (P = 0.0020), ST rumb (P = 0.0055), ST flank (P = 0.0001) and heat tolerance coefficient (HTC) (P = 0.0010). For sheep confined in full sun, a strong correlation was observed between the RR and the mean ST (MST; r = 0.6826; P = 0.0236) and between the final loin eye area (LEAf) with the real LEA (LEAr) (r = 0.9263; P = 0.0001) and slaughter body weight (SBW) (r = 0.7532; P = 0.0325). For negative RFI sheep, a positive correlation was observed between the RR and the ST rump (r = 0.7343; P = 0.0025) and ST ribs (r = 0.6560; P = 0.0178) and the MST (r = 0.7435; P = 0.0001), between the MST and the LEAr (r = 0.6837; P = 0.0025) and the final LEA (r = 0.6771; P = 0.0144), and between the final LEA and LEAr (r = 0.9942; P = 0.0001), BW (r = 0.8415; P = 0.0277) and MST (r = 0.6771; P = 0.0045). Positive RFI sheep confined to shade showed a high correlation between final LEA and LEAr (r = 0.9372; P = 0.0001). The use of shading in confined Dorper sheep, regardless of the RFI classification, reduces the effects of heat stress on physiological parameters.

AB  - Teressa goat is a unique goat breed in Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI) of India. Effects of Flaxseed oil (FSO) supplementation in body weight (BW), scrotal circumference (SC), testicular volume (TV) and testicular weight (TW), endocrinological profiles, sex behavioural profiles (SBPs), oxidative stress markers and semen production and its quality profiles in rainy and dry summer season were studied in Teressa goat. Male goats (n = 12) of 3-4 years old were equally divided into control and treated groups. Treated animals received 25 mL FSO per day. Oral drenching of FSO was done in the morning before feeding the concentrate ration. Body weight, scrotal circumference, TV and TW were measured in bucks of FSO treated and untreated during rainy and dry summer seasons. Blood follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), cortisol and prolactin, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured in bucks of FSO treated and untreated during rainy and dry summer seasons. Libido score (LS), mating ability score (MAS) and sex behavioural score (SBS) were estimated at time of semen collection in bucks of FSO treated and untreated during rainy and dry summer seasons. Semen samples (n = 100; 50 semen samples from each season; each 25 semen samples from control and treatment groups per season) were collected and analysed for semen quality profiles. One-way ANOVA (control rainy, control dry, treated rainy and treated dry) revealed that BW, SC, TV and TW, FSH, LH, testosterone, TSH, T3 and T4 were higher (P < 0.05) and cortisol and prolactin were lower (P < 0.05) in FSO treated bucks of rainy season followed by untreated bucks of rainy season, FSO treated bucks of dry summer season and were lower (P < 0.05) in untreated bucks of dry summer season. Similarly, TAC, CAT, SOD and GSH, LS, MAS and SBS, and volume, pH, sperm concentration, mass activity, total motility (TM), viability, acrosomal integrity (AcI), plasma membrane integrity (PMI) and nuclear integrity (NI) were higher (P < 0.05) and MDA and TSA were lower (P < 0.05) in FSO treated bucks of rainy season followed by FSO treated bucks of dry summer season, untreated bucks of rainy season and were lower (P < 0.05) in untreated bucks of dry summer season. The results of the present study indicated that the breeding bucks suffered physiological stress (higher cortisol), oxidative stress (higher MDA and deficiency of antioxidants), hormonal imbalance (higher prolactin and cortisol and deficiency of gonadotropins, gonadal hormone and thyroid hormones) and infertility due to poor libido and poor semen production and its quality profiles during dry summer season. Thus, dry summer was more stressful season compared to rainy season for the goat bucks. FSO supplementation mitigated these stresses and improved the scrotal and testicular biometrics, libido, antioxidants, hormones and semen quality profiles in Teressa goat bucks. The current study concluded that FSO effectively improved the hormones, libido, antioxidant profiles, and scrotal and testicular biometrics with cascading beneficial effects on semen quality profiles in Teressa goat bucks under humid tropical island ecosystem of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

AB  - Candidia barbata is a primary freshwater fish distributed in the western portion of Taiwan Island, but this species has also been found in southern and eastern Taiwan. Previous studies have documented that human-intervention populations of freshwater fishes exist not only in eastern Taiwan but also widely. To investigate the native population genetic diversity and structure and evaluate the sources of human-intervention populations of C. barbata, the sequences from the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene and d-loop region were analyzed. These results indicated that (1) the native populations were distributed in northern, northwestern, western and southwestern Taiwan; (2) the human-intervention populations originated from multiple sources, including native populations and aquarium stocks; (3) most aquarium stocks originated from the northwestern and western populations; (4) the geological history of Taiwan Island shaped the native distribution range and population genetic structure; (5) the effective size of the populations declined greatly; and (6) the native populations could be assorted into three distinct management significant units (alpha - gamma). Finally, the human-mediated dispersal of freshwater species in Taiwan was more severe than expected and should be evaluated and monitored carefully.

AB  - The alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster) is a critically endangered species in China whose wild populations have precipitously declined due to habitat degradation and poaching. In response, China established the world's first captive breeding facility for this species in 1990. Despite over three decades of closed breeding, the genetic consequences of long-term captivity remain unclear. Here, we present the first comprehensive assessment of mitochondrial genetic diversity in a captive population of 409 individuals, using three mitochondrial markers (D-loop, Cytb, and COI) and comparative data from wild conspecifics. Our results reveal a pronounced reduction in genetic diversity in the captive population compared to wild populations. Nucleotide diversity (pi) and haplotype diversity (Hd) were consistently lower across all markers in captivity, with D-loop Hd = 0.639 and pi = 0.01073. Further combined sequence analysis revealed a single dominant haplotype (Hap4) representing 56.99% of individuals, indicative of severe haplotype loss and homogenization. Although some haplotypes are shared with wild populations, captive populations exhibit strong genetic differentiation from wild populations, with the captive populations retaining only a limited fraction of the species' maternal lineages. This pronounced genetic erosion driven by strong founder effects and genetic drift raises concerns about the viability and reintroduction success of this species. These findings highlight the inherent limitations of closed captive populations in preserving evolutionary potential and adaptive capacity. Our study emphasizes the urgent need for evidence-based genetic management, including founder augmentation and population exchange, to mitigate inbreeding and maintain genetic diversity.

AB  - Herbivorous fishes play important roles on coral reefs, acting as key trophic conduits of primary productivity. Whilst these roles are widely appreciated on tropical reefs, the relative contribution of fishes which inhabit marginal reefs, such as Prionurus surgeonfishes, is not well understood. Here, we examine the extent to which herbivorous fish productivity varies amongst global ecoregions, specifically considering the relative contribution of Prionurus. We also compare the productivity of Prionurus to that of other herbivorous fishes in relation to water temperatures. Our analysis revealed that the Eastern Galapagos Islands support the highest levels of herbivorous fish productivity recorded to date, with Prionurus laticlavius accounting for over 94% of that productivity. Moreover, Prionurus productivity peaked at relatively cool water temperatures (similar to 22-25(degrees)C), although patterns were driven by P. laticlavius. These results highlight the exceptional herbivorous fish productivity in the Eastern Galapagos Islands and the disproportionate contribution of P. laticlavius in this locality.

AB  - Termites are one of the most relevant groups for recycling nutrients and keeping the flow of energy in ecosystems. Although their role as lignocellulose decomposers is the focus of studies, they also act as dung recyclers, but their importance in this process is poorly understood. Here we performed manipulation experiments to determine dung removal by termites in forest remnants and cattle pastures in a fragmented Atlantic Forest landscape. We used wire bags of different mesh sizes placed along transects in three forest fragments and pastures for 10 days to compare the contribution of termites and other coprophagous macrodetritivores to dung removal. Our results indicated that termites removed more dung in pastures than in the forest fragments. In addition, dung beetle exclusion significantly reduced the percentage of dung removal within forest fragments, but not on pastures, indicating termites are important dung recyclers in pastures.

AB  - The distribution of the threatened fern Ophioglossum vulgatum L., a plant with extremely small populations (PSESPs) in Sardinia, is characterized by small disjunct populations with only a few individuals, and little is known about its status in the wild. To provide information for the conservation of O. vulgatum and with the aim to develop an in situ conservation strategy, we investigated its distribution, population size, and habitat. Field surveys confirmed that the species grows in only five localities. Two representative populations were selected for this study (Funtanamela and Gedili), and in each population, all plants were mapped and monitored monthly from April to August over an 8-year period. During the study, the populations had a very low number of reproductive plants and the populations appeared to be in decline, with the total number of plants per population slightly decreased in Gedili while a sharp reduction was recorded in Funtanamela due to wild boar threat. A fence was built in order to protect the site from further damage, but no noticeable signals of recovery were observed. The most urgent conservation requirement for this species is to preserve the threatened habitat of the remnant populations. Further field surveys and research are also required for an improved understanding of the species' status.

AB  - The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is one of the main invasive species in Chile, where it became naturalized ca. 150 years ago. Their high reproductive capacity, lack of specialist predators, and great adaptability favored the settlement of rabbits in diverse mainland and island ecosystems of the country. Recently, rabbits have become central players in semi-arid ecosystems, such as those represented in Las Chinchillas National Reserve in north-central Chile. We undertook to analyze the place and role of rabbits in the food web of that Reserve, based on a bibliographic review and long-term annual data gathered from 1987 until 2022 (36 years). Results showed that the network comprised 77 species, where 69% were primary producers (plants), 18% were mid-level consumers (herbivores), and 13% were top-level consumers (predators). The most connected species in the food web was the rabbit, which positively or negatively affected the species interacting with it. Predators such as Galictis cuja, Geranoaetus polyosoma, Leopardus colocolo, and Puma concolor, and the scavenger Vultur gryphus, could be negatively affected by an eventual decrease (natural or human-caused) in the rabbit population of the Reserve. To the contrary, primary producers such as Oxalis perdicaria, Plantago hispidula, Schizanthus parvulus, Senna cumminggi, and Tropaeolum azureum could be positively affected by an increase in their biomass in response to a decrease in rabbits, favoring native rodents. We consider that analyzing the rabbit-centered food web and its impacts on native interacting species allows a better understanding of the relevance of invasive species in the local community, providing conceptual tools for rabbit management.

AB  - Desecheo Island (117 ha) was historically an important seabird island in the Caribbean with 15 species recorded, of which seven are known to breed, including major populations of brown boobies and red-footed bobbies. The introduction of invasive mammals, plus the use of the island as a bombing range, contributed to the extirpation of five of the seven known breeding populations of seabird species and vastly reduced numbers of the remaining two species. The island became a National Wildlife Refuge in 1976 and major conservation interventions have included the eradication of invasive goats, rhesus macaques and rats between 1976 and 2016. Removing these critical threats from the island has allowed other active restoration goals to be realized, including restoring seabird colonies to the island. Here, we report on the installation of social attraction equipment in 2018 to augment bridled tern and brown noddy colonies and establish a species of conservation concern, the Audubon's shearwater. We supported these actions through a review of historic seabird nesting and roosting on Desecheo. Motion-sensing cameras were installed to document activity at each social attraction site and evaluate the effectiveness of our methods. During the 2 years of deployment and monitoring, a total of seven bridled tern nests were documented in new and historic sites for the species, two of them next to a decoy colony; however, no brown noddy visits or nests were detected. In 2018 and 2019, one and two Audubon's shearwaters, respectively, were attracted to one of the sound system speakers, representing the first record for this species on the island. Social attraction efforts on Desecheo appears to be a feasible activity that may help support seabird recolonization and support conservation goals for this National Wildlife Refuge.

AB  - Pachylemur is a large extinct lemur once widespread on Madagascar that survived in pockets until at least 500 years ago. The role of humans as agents of megafaunal extinction on Madagascar is heavily debated. Here we evaluate human impacts drawing from research on lemur hunting today combined with evidence from Madagascar's oral history as well as its archaeological and paleontological records. Living lemurs are hunted throughout Madagascar, primarily for subsistence but also for commercial trade. Wildlife consumption is driven primarily by poverty and resultant food insecurity. Protected status, wildlife consumption taboos, and broad preference for domestic meats appear insufficient to buffer most lemur taxa from extinction at current harvest rates in the Makira region, if not elsewhere. Singlefactor explanations for megafaunal extinction, such as rapid overkill or climate change, are not viable. There was long temporal overlap for Pachylemur and humans on Madagascar. There was no island-wide drought when the megafauna began to crash around 1,200 years ago; some parts of Madagascar were unusually wet while others were unusually dry. Stable isotope (d15N) values for radiocarbon-dated Pachylemur bones also show no evidence that aridification contributed to its demise. Butchered bones of Pachylemur from the paleontological site Tsirave spike in frequency just over 1,000 years ago, indicative of sustained exploitation over a similar to 100year period. Pachylemur shared many traits with its closest living relative, variegated lemurs (Varecia), including frugivory. Oral histories of an animal presumed to be Pachylemur indicate it dwelt in the largest trees in the forest, was active at twilight, and exhibited highly aggressive antipredator behavior. Like Varecia, Pachylemur was likely dependent on large, patchily distributed trees for fruit, and possibly also for reproduction (e.g. to nest and stash non-clinging young), making it especially vulnerable to habitat degradation. We thus conclude that both habitat degradation and hunting played a role in the extinction of Pachylemur.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Intensified rice cultivation is mostly associated with high input of pesticides. Beneficial arthropods decrease in such environments while pesticide-resistant herbivores can increase, which, in turn, leads to even higher pesticide applications. To break the vicious circle, it is important to implement sustainable farming approaches. Here, we tested such an approach called "ecological engineering" (EE), where non-rice crops were grown in the surroundings of rice fields to provide additional food sources for beneficial arthropods. Farmers did not spray EE fields with pesticides in contrast to conventionally farmed fields, which had no crops in the surroundings, serving as a comparison. Additionally, we included control fields, which were neither treated with pesticides nor had crops in the surroundings. We interviewed farmers to obtain insight about their preference for crops growing in the surroundings and their willingness to use this approach. Our results showed that the yield of EE rice fields was equal to that of conventionally farmed fields. In addition, the benefit-cost ratio was highest for EE and the control fields highlighting their economic advantage. The abundance of parasitoids was lower in conventionally farmed treatments. The proper implementation of EE in combination with farmers' choice of crops is a promising solution towards sustainable rice production.
   Rice production is often associated with high pesticide input. To improve farmers' practice, sustainable management approaches are urgently needed, such as ecological engineering (EE), which aims at enhancing beneficial arthropods while reducing pesticides. Here, we implemented and tested EE in Cambodian rice fields by comparing: (i) fields not treated with pesticides (control); (ii) fields not treated with pesticides but with non-rice crops planted in the surrounding (EE); and (iii) conventionally farmed fields using pesticides (CR). Using benefit-cost analysis, we compared the economic value of each treatment. The non-rice crops preferred by men and women farmers as well as farmers' willingness to implement EE were assessed using surveys. We sampled arthropod abundance and richness in rice fields and bunds during two seasons. During the dry season, we compared EE and CR among three Cambodian provinces. During the wet season, we specifically assessed the differences in EE, control and CR in arthropod abundance and rice yield in one province. While withholding from using pesticides did not result in a decrease in yield in EE and control treatments, parasitoid abundance was higher in both treatments during the wet season. The benefit-cost ratio was highest for EE and control treatments. Pesticides were likely the main driver causing low arthropod abundance, without any benefit towards increased rice yield. The proper implementation of EE coupled with farmers' knowledge of ecologically based pest management is a promising solution towards sustainable rice production.

AB  - Arar (Juniperus phoenicea L.) is a small monoecious or dioecious evergreen species presenting as a shrub or tree around the Mediterranean. This widespread plant is also causing problems in Croatia, along its Adriatic coastal area and in particular on the island of Pag. It affects the establishment and growth of other species that share its habitat and has also reduced the grazing areas of local sheep breeding and beekeeping communities. Arar is also a frequent cause of wildfires in the region. Its spread is indeed far-reaching, from its impact on plants and livestock to its adverse effects on the local population and its tourism, which is one of the main components of the island's economy. This research aimed to evaluate biomass and biochar samples of arar, using standard methods to verify their potential energy value. Results of the study showed a favorable content of coke (16.28%) and volatiles (77.26%) in the samples. The C, H, S, N, and O ratios of the samples were 50.14%, 6.57%, 0.31%, 0.84% and 42.13%, respectively. The higher calorific value was 20.45 MJ center dot kg(-1) for biomass and 29.01 MJ center dot kg(-1) for biochar.

AB  - The presence of edible and inedible prey species in a food web can influence the strength that nutrients (bottom-up) or herbivores (top-down) have on primary production. In boreal peatlands, wetter more nutrient-rich conditions associated with ongoing climate change are expanding consumer access to aquatic habitat and promoting sources of primary production (i.e., algae) that are susceptible to trophic regulation. Here, we used an in situ mesocosm experiment to evaluate the consequences of enhanced nutrient availability and food-web manipulation (herbivore and predator exclusion) on algal assemblage structure in an Alaskan fen. Owing to the potential for herbivores to selectively consume edible algae (small cells) in favor of more resistant forms, we predicted that the proportion of less-edible algae (large cells) would determine the strength of top-down or bottom-up effects. Consistent with these expectations, we observed an increase in algal-cell size in the presence of herbivores (2-tiered food web) that was absent in the presence of a trophic cascade (3-tiered food web), suggesting that predators indirectly prevented morphological changes in the algal assemblage by limiting herbivory. Increases in algal-cell size with herbivory were driven by a greater proportion of filamentous green algae and nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, whose size and morphological characteristics mechanically minimize consumption. While consumer-driven shifts in algal assemblage structure were significant, they did not prevent top-down regulation of biofilm development by herbivores. Our findings show that increasing wet periods in northern peatlands will provide new avenues for trophic regulation of algal production, including directly through consumption and indirectly via a trophic cascade.

AB  - In this study, we focus on threatened flora in Spain to analyze the role of various drivers of herbivory in the process by which plants become endangered, attempting to identify patterns in the drivers and threats. Thus, using Hurdle negative binomial regression models, we first test whether herbivory, as a reported threat, is spatially related to its drivers. In the second step, through exploratory data analysis, we study patterns of the herbivory threat in relation to biogeography and conservation factors. Finally, we model the spatial relationships of herbivory to produce a map of hotspots. Our main finding points to wild herbivores, rather than domestic animals, as the major contributors to defining the present spatial distribution of herbivory threatened plants in Spain. Furthermore, we identify the elevation variable as another important factor. Thus, at higher altitudes, there is a correlation between the number of rare plants, high wild herbivores presence, and the existence of protected areas. At present, mountain areas experience conflicts of interest in the conservation of wildlife and rare plants. At the same time, in lower- elevation areas, livestock are no longer concentrated in the lowlands, which reduces direct pressure on rare plants. Accordingly, we propose specific management strategies: for lowland areas, we propose promoting the presence of wild herbivores. At higher altitudes, we propose to use of natural predators as a tool for plant conservation. In the case of Island herbivory, the active removal of non-native animals using negotiation with diverse social groups is necessary.

AB  - Lethal trapping of island invasive rodents is a critical practice used by management organizations to protect native biota. Carcass detection from lethal trapping is dependent on the trapping method, carcass palatability, and scavengers present. Goodnature A24 self-resetting rat traps are an effective tool in remote areas and complex terrain because traps can be visited at 4-6 month intervals and produce multiple carcasses during that interval. The goal of this study was to determine whether we are a) underestimating target mortality with carcass counts and b) failing to detect non-target mortality between A24 trap checks at two field sites on the island of Kauai. Both sites have established Goodnature A24 trap grids with 300 A24s deployed by the Kauai Forest Bird Recovery Project (KFBRP), and one site is fenced to exclude invasive ungulates. KFBRP conducts routine trap checks every four months, finding 0-3 rat or mouse carcasses at each trap. We assumed that traps kill more animals than indicated by carcass counts because 75% of traps have counters to record when traps fire, and counter tallies usually exceed carcass counts. In 2018 and 2019, several bird carcasses were found under traps; therefore, we needed to investigate the likelihood that non-target mortality went undetected. In May 2019, we placed 60 carcasses (30 non-native birds and 30 rats) at a fenced site, and 60 carcasses (30 bird, 30 rat) at an unfenced site, in both gulches and uplands. Carcasses were periodically surveyed for 120 days after deployment. The unfenced site had greater removal rates, notably in gulches; 33 of 60 carcasses remained detectable, compared to 52 of 60 carcasses at the fenced site. Bird and rat carcasses did not differ in persistence, and taxon did not affect scavenger preference. These results suggest that significant non-target mortality has not gone undetected in our A24 trap grid because we are likely to detect most target and non-target carcasses after four months in fenced areas, and especially upland unfenced areas. However, we are less likely to detect carcasses in the unfenced gulches where ungulate scavengers are prevalent, and increased monitoring may be needed in such gulches.

AB  - Port Biological Baseline Surveys (PBBS) are standardized surveys of the indigenous and non-indigenous marine biodiversity within harbour activities. They provide a baseline for monitoring changes in the structure and function of harbour communities. This study conducted in 12 fishing and industrial harbours from January to December 2018 was the first initiative of a Port Baseline Survey aimed to assess the impact of biological invasions in harbours of the Gulf of Gabes (GG), Tunisia. A total of 174 macrobenthos species were recorded, belonging to eight phyla, with a dominance of crustaceans (32%), molluscs (31%) and polychaetes (20%). Among these species, 57 were non-indigenous species (NIS) for Tunisian waters, while 27 species were recorded for the first time in GG harbours, and three decapods (Dyspanopeus sayi, Hippolyte prideauxiana and Pilumnus minutus) and one amphipod (Hamimaera hamigera) were newly recorded from Tunisian waters. Two main categories of harbours are distinguished according to their macrobenthic communities and environmental conditions. The industrial harbours yield higher richness and abundance of NIS than the fishing harbours. The ALEX metric is used to evaluate the biological invasion status of the Gulf of Gabes harbours and shows that their status ranges from unaffected in fishing harbours to extremely affected in industrial harbours. Three biotic indices (AMBI, BO2A and BENTIX) are applied to assess the ecological status of harbours, which varies from moderate to good. ALEX and the other biotic indices are significantly correlated with harbour characteristics, maritime traffic and edaphic factors (organic matter and chemical contamination). The present study provides a data baseline for the implementation of environmental policies and management plans in the future.

AB  - Despite Orchidaceae is a key component of the epiphytic flora of tropical and subtropical forests, phenological studies of this group are rare, mainly due to technical difficulties in observing epiphytes, the reduced abundance of wild specimens, and to the evergreen characteristic of these plants. We monitored shoot and root production of translocated young plants of the epiphytic orchid Cattleya intermedia Graham at the edge and in the interior of a subtropical Atlantic Forest fragment, and investigated their relationship with temperature, luminosity, photoperiod, rainfall and air humidity. Individuals propagated in vitro were translocated in the spring and inspected monthly for 3 years for shoot and root production. Shoot production at the edge of the forest was positively related with photoperiod and luminosity. In the interior, this relationship was characterised by a 1-month time delay. The highest concentrations of plants with shoot production occurred in spring and summer in both environments. Interior plants were more likely to produce roots in spring and summer, while edge plants were more likely to produce roots in summer. Edge plants produced fewer roots when rainfall was high, while interior plants produced more roots when interior air humidity was high. The influence of light availability for translocated plants was demonstrated by the different responses of shoot growth at the edge and in the interior of the forest and by the relationship with the seasonal variation of this variable. Thus, light becomes a key factor for the establishment of translocated C. intermedia and must be considered in the choice of their habitats.

AB  - Wild small rodents are considered the natural reservoirs of Mycobacterium microti, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) that can cause tuberculosis (TB) in humans and animals, as well as interfere with current tuberculosis eradication plans in livestock. A cross-sectional study was carried out in the Catalan Pyrenees (Iberian Peninsula) in an area where M. microti was previously isolated from wild boars, to evaluate the role of micromammals in the epidemiology of this outbreak. A total of 350 wild rodents were necropsied (306 Murinae and 44 Arvicolinae) in spring and autumn during two consecutive natural years. Tissues were analyzed by histopathology to look for TB-like lesions and by qPCR and culture to detect MTBC. Sera were analyzed by MTBC-specific ELISA. No evidence of TB infection in wild rodents was confirmed. Results suggest that small rodents did not play a role in the epidemiology of M. microti in the area. The source of this mycobacterium remains unknown, but previous detections of M. microti in various species in southern France suggest the movements of wild boars across the French Pyrenees as the most likely origin of the outbreak detected in the Iberian Peninsula.

AB  - Accurate estimates of population size are central to the management and conservation of wild ungulates. Counting animals from vantage points of baited sites is a method that is traditionally used in Europe to obtain abundance estimates of wild ungulates, but its reliability in forested landscapes is contested. We assessed the accuracy of vantage point counts (VPCs) for estimating population size in red deer (Cervus elaphus) at De Hoge Veluwe National Park, a fenced, partially forested game reserve in the Netherlands. We compared estimates from duplicated VPCs for 1977-2010 with population sizes reconstructed from cohort analyses of age-specific mortality records, including and excluding supplementation with vehicular direct counts (VDCs) and field knowledge on herd composition and herd size from game wardens. Estimates from VPCs supplemented with VDCs matched the reconstructed population size well for 2001-2010. In addition, estimates based on =;1 VPC site/11 km(2) provided representative estimates of the reconstructed population size in that period. Simultaneous VPCs at multiple baited sites can yield precise population estimates for red deer in forests.

AB  - Across the range of African elephants Loxodonta spp., negative interactions with people are prevalent, and the impact of the resulting economic losses on farmers calls for solutions. The use of beehive fences, a mitigation method with ecological and socio-economic benefits, is gaining momentum in African savannah landscapes. We assessed the diurnal and nocturnal defensive behaviours of African honeybees Apis mellifera adansonii in response to visual and physical disturbances in the Campo-Ma'an conservation area, Cameroon. We examined six bee colonies, assessing their activity level, aggressive behaviour and ability to defend themselves when disturbed at different times of day. We found that activity levels varied between colonies and that colonies were more active during the day and inactive at night. The defensive perimeter around the hives also varied between the colonies and was generally greater during morning and evening periods. Bee colonies did not defend their hives around midday and at night. In response to a threat, bees were more likely to fly out from the hive during daytime than at night, with variation amongst colonies. Overall, as elephant intrusions occur mostly at night, beehive fences alone may not be an adequate mitigation method against crop damage caused by forest elephants Loxodonta cyclotis. We suggest combining beehive fences with other mitigation methods to improve crop protection.

AB  - Insular gigantism is an evolutionary phenomenon whereby small animals become bigger on islands compared to their mainland relatives. The abundance of insular giant taxa in the fossil record suggests the presence of a universal "giant niche" present on islands, with resource limitation as a potential driver for this process. However, insular habitats are ecologically diverse, suggesting that island taxa adopt different survival strategies, including adaptations for foraging behaviors. Here, we used finite element analysis to evaluate insular feeding niche adaptations in some of the most extreme examples of insular gigantism: Mediterranean giant dormice. We calculated stress, strain, and mechanical advantage during incisor and molar biting for 3 extinct insular giant species (Leithia melitensis, Hypnomys morpheus, and H. onicensis), an extant giant (Eliomys quercinus ophiusae), and their extant non-giant mainland relative, the generalist-feeder Eliomys quercinus. Our results show that dietary adaptations vary between giant taxa on different islands, and can occur relatively rapidly. Furthermore, the functional mandibular morphology in some insular taxa indicate adaptations moving away from a generalist feeding strategy toward greater trophic specialization. We show that the "insular giant niche" varies between islands and across time periods, arguing against a universal ecological driver for insular gigantism in small mammals.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts are a growing problem in Northern Hemisphere where wild ungulates are one of the taxonomic groups most frequently involved. To mitigate these conflicts, it is essential to develop preventive actions able to avoid encounters between wildlife and human (activities). We here employed photo-trapping to evaluate the behaviour of red deer (Cervus elaphus) when confronted with dissuasive portable deterrents that function on the basis of changing patterns of light and ultrasound. This was done by following a before/after experimental design, with two phases: (i) a test phase, with active deterrents, and (ii) a control phase, without deterrents. When deterrents were activated they achieved a 48.96% reduction in the frequency of use by red deer (up to 66.64% when it was assessed on a thinner Sect. 10 m wide from the line of deterrents) and produced a reduction of 67.71% in the frequency of deterrent-line crossings. However, a habituation effect was detected since the use by red deer of the treatment area increased as time since treatment. These results indicate that these portable devices are effective as regards dissuading deer, mainly on short time scales. The deterrents tested here could be suitable for use at focal points for short periods or in combination with other methods to improve their effectiveness in vulnerability points. This device could potentially be used to mitigate conflicts caused by wildlife species and in response to relevant and timely situations, such as vehicle collisions and damage to crops, among others.

AB  - Introduction Bone, as both a crucial organ with mechanical support and immune regulatory functions, profoundly influencing the growth and development of fish in aquaculture systems. Deer antler and its aqueous extract Cervi Cornus Colla (CCC), are natural medicinal substances known for their bone-protective properties.Methods This study investigated the osteoprotective effects of CCC against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced injury to fish bones. An LPS-mediated zebrafish skeletal injury model was established and evaluated using Alcian Blue/Alizarin Red staining, fluorescence tracing, ELISA, and qPCR.Results The median lethal concentration (LC50) of CCC in zebrafish was 206.3 mg/mL, and staining revealed that CCC reversed LPS-induced reduction in cartilage and bone formation in a dose-dependent manner. In Tg (mpeg1: EGFP) zebrafish, CCC treatment significantly decreased macrophages-associated green fluorescence, suggesting that the extract suppressed the activation of macrophages caused by LPS. CCC also reduced the production of several inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL- 1 beta, and NO). Furthermore, qRT-PCR confirmed CCC restored COL2 alpha 1 and Sox9a mRNA levels. Additional studies revealed CCC inhibits LPS-induced activation of the TGF-beta/Smad3 signaling pathway.Discussion This study demonstrates that CCC can alleviate zebrafish bone injury, thereby providing an experimental basis for its application in the prevention and treatment of bone diseases in farmed fish.

AB  - Recreational hunting, especially big game trophy hunting, has a significant impact on large areas and requires specific wildlife management strategies. However, because the pursuit of maximum hunter satisfaction can jeopardize species conservation, it is crucial to identify the factors that determine recreational trophy hunter satisfaction. We investigated these factors in southern Spain by attending 21 dog-driven Iberian red deer hunts over seven hunting seasons. We collected geographic and biometric data from 556 hunted specimens and conducted 159 face-to-face surveys with hunters. Based on partial least squares path models, our findings indicate that overall satisfaction is positively related to the dimensions of achievement, appreciation, and service. Contextual variables, including hunter experience, hunting scenarios, and individual and group hunting bags, showed varying effects on these satisfaction dimensions. Management decisions significantly influenced multiple dimensions of hunter satisfaction, with potential implications for conservation in our study system and broader considerations for natural game management versus canned hunting practices.

AB  - Some introduced species cause severe damage, although the majority have little impact. Robust predictions of which species are most likely to cause substantial impacts could focus efforts to mitigate those impacts or prevent certain invasions entirely. Introduced herbivorous insects can reduce crop yield, fundamentally alter natural and managed forest ecosystems, and are unique among invasive species in that they require certain host plants to succeed. Recent studies have demonstrated that understanding the evolutionary history of introduced herbivores and their host plants can provide robust predictions of impact. Specifically, divergence times between hosts in the native and introduced ranges of a nonnative insect can be used to predict the potential impact of the insect should it establish in a novel ecosystem. However, divergence time estimates vary among published phylogenetic datasets, making it crucial to understand if and how the choice of phylogeny affects prediction of impact. Here, we tested the robustness of impact prediction to variation in host phylogeny by using insects that feed on conifers and predicting the likelihood of high impact using four different published phylogenies. Our analyses ranked 62 insects that are not established in North America and 47 North American conifer species according to overall risk and vulnerability, respectively. We found that results were robust to the choice of phylogeny. Although published vascular plant phylogenies continue to be refined, our analysis indicates that those differences are not substantial enough to alter the predictions of invader impact. Our results can assist in focusing biosecurity programs for conifer pests and can be more generally applied to nonnative insects and their potential hosts by prioritizing surveillance for those insects most likely to be damaging invaders.

AB  - The dependency of the anti-herbivore defense on ant-plant protective mutualism often varies depending on abiotic and biotic conditions. Although intraspecific competition is a primary interaction between neighboring plants, its effects on ant-plant mutualisms have yet to be sufficiently elucidated. In order to determine the effects of intraspecific competition and competitor genotype on ant-plant mutualisms, I conducted competition and ant-removal experiments and examined their effects on damage to the leaves of Urena lobata var. tomentosa plants. I found that larger numbers of worker ants visited the plants growing with non-siblings than plants growing alone and that plants growing with non-siblings had a higher shoot to root ratio and secreted greater volumes of extrafloral nectar than plants growing alone and/or with siblings. Under the presence of both sibling and non-sibling competitors, I observed that when ants were removed from plants, those grown with conspecific neighbors were characterized by a higher percentage of damaged leaf area than plants harboring ants. The effect of ant exclusion on leaf damage was more pronounced in plants grown with non-siblings than those grown near siblings. However, when the plants were grown alone, I detected no significant difference in percentage leaf damage between the ant-excluded and ant-harboring plants. The results indicate that neighboring plants can exert strong effects on ant-plant protective mutualisms, thereby highlighting the need to take into consideration plant-plant interactions in studies on these mutualistic associations.

AB  - Nutrient-rich waters along the Pacific coast of North America support diverse fish communities that have helped sustain coastal peoples for millennia. Five Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations on the west coast of what is now known as Vancouver Island, Canada, hold constitutional Indigenous rights to conduct a multispecies community fishery, which includes Pacific Halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis). A 2009 court decision defined the extent of these Indigenous rights to be within 9 nm of the coast, thereby not fully recognizing the knowledge and authority of the traditional leadership and raising concerns about the potential for an increase in rockfish bycatch. Yelloweye Rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) are a potential 'choke' species for this fishery because the two species occupy similar depth ranges. A choke species is one that is caught incidentally while targeting other species and, if caught in excess of its quota limits, can trigger a halt to fishing on the target species. Guided by the insights of local Indigenous peoples and using both fishery-independent survey and commercial longline catch data, we investigated the effects of fishing depth and spatial restriction on the relative catch weights of these two species using spatiotemporal models. We find evidence that a confined fishing area can limit opportunities for avoiding choke species. Specifically, fishing at depths deeper than 175 m, which occur outside the court defined area (CDA), would provide more opportunities for catching halibut while avoiding Yelloweye Rockfish than are currently available within the CDA. This Indigenous-informed, analytical approach to a management problem is just one example of how Western scientists can engage in coproduction of knowledge with Indigenous peoples to transition from the 'status quo' towards a practice of 'Two-Eyed Seeing' that more effectively balances Indigenous rights and species conservation. Policy implications: Our study highlights (1) the importance of considering choke species distributions and opportunities for their avoidance when implementing spatial harvest restrictions and (2) how related analytical and management decisions can benefit from being guided by the advice of Indigenous knowledge holders.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Rewilding attempts to increase biodiversity and restore natural ecosystem processes by reducing human influence. Today, there is growing interest in rewilding urban areas. Rewilding of the Detroit, Michigan, USA and Windsor, Ontario, Canada metropolitan area, and its shared natural resource called the Detroit River, has been delineated through the reintroduction of peregrine falcons and osprey, and a return of other sentinel species like bald eagles, lake sturgeon, lake whitefish, walleye, beaver, and river otter. Rewilding has helped showcase the value and benefits of environmental protection and restoration, ecosystem services, habitat rehabilitation and enhancement, and conservation, including social and economic benefits. Improved ecosystem health and rewilding have become a catalyst for re-establishing a reconnection between urban denizens and natural resources through greenways and water trails. The provision of compelling outdoor experiences in nature, in turn, can help foster a personal attachment to the particular place people call home that can help inspire a stewardship ethic.

AB  - Asiatic wild ass, or kulan (Equus hemionus kulan) were once a key species of the Eurasian steppes and deserts. In Kazakhstan they went extinct by the 1930s. Early reintroductions have reestablished the species in two protected areas, but the species has reclaimed <1% of their former range and remained absent from central Kazakhstan. To initiate restoration in this vast region, we captured and transported a first group of nine wild kulan to a large pre-release enclosure in the Torgai region in 2017, and two more in 2019. We used direct observations and post-release movement data of four kulan equipped with GPS-Iridium collars to document their adaptation process in a vast novel habitat without conspecifics. For comparison with movements in the source populations, we additionally equipped two kulan in Altyn Emel National Park and six in Barsa Kelmes State Nature Reserve. The nine transported kulan formed a cohesive group with very high movement correlation in the enclosure. After release, the group initially stayed tightly together but started to break up by mid-May and all kulan travelled independently by mid-August. With 48,680-136,953 km(2), the 95% Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimation ranges of the reintroduced kulan were huge and about 10-100 times larger than those in the source populations. The reintroduced mares never reconnected, there was no evidence of successful reproduction, and two of the four collared mares were killed by poachers and one died of natural causes. At least one stallion survived in the wild, but the fate of the other uncollared animals remains unclear. We speculate that the fission-fusion dynamics and low movement correlation of kulan societies and the need for migratory movements harbours the risk that animals released into a novel environment loose contact with each other. This risk is likely enhanced in steppe habitats where movement constraining factors are absent. Further kulan reintroductions to the steppes and deserts of central Kazakhstan should aim to release larger groups and build up the free-ranging population quickly to reach a critical mass, increasing the chance of kulan encountering conspecifics to successfully breed and increase their chances of survival.

AB  - Farming livestock-cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and chickens-contributes to the air pollution of the atmosphere. Agricultural air pollution comes mainly in the form of ammonia, which enters the air as a gas from heavily fertilized fields and livestock waste. A reduction in air pollutants from the livestock sector can be achieved by reducing production and consumption, lowering the emission intensity of production, or combining the two. This work proposes an approach for assessing the air pollutant emissions derived from intensive cattle farming. For doing this, the animal feed, the animal behavior, and characteristics and the stable environment data are monitored and collected by a cloud platform. Specifically, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are installed in the farm and key air pollutant parameters from the stable environment (such as CO, NH3, PM1, PM2.5, PM10) are monitored. In this scope, a study about monitoring air pollutants is conducted, showing the most relevant platforms used in this domain. Additionally, the paper presents a comparison between the estimated and monitored air pollutants (AP), showing the fluctuation of the measured parameters. The key takeaway of the study is that ammonia concentration has a higher level during the night, being influenced by the ventilation system of the farm.

AB  - Production of pork based on monoculture cereal-based cropping systems causes sub-stantial environmental pressures and feed-food competition. This study evaluated the environmental consequences of five different scenarios involving inclusion of rotational grass-clover leys and incorporation of grass-clover biomass in pig diets: (1) a conven-tional reference scenario without grass-clover biomass; (2) a conventional scenario with replacement of feed with grass-clover silage in a total mixed ration, i.e., with grass-clover biomass replacing other feed; (3) an organic scenario using grass-clover silage for enrichment purposes only; (4) an organic scenario using grass-clover silage for enrichment purposes and additional grass-clover leys for green manuring; and (5) an organic scenario using grass-clover silage and pasture to replace feed. The functional unit was 1 kg of pork slaughter weight and the system boundary was from cradle to farm gate. We used life cycle assessment, the introductory carbon balance method and human edible feed conversion efficiency to assess the performance of the pig production system. Introducing grass-clover biomass as a total mixed ration in conventional pig diets, reduced the climate impact (-17%), eutrophication (-7.1%), marine eutrophication (-15%), energy use (-13%), and feed-food competition (-20%) per kg of pork meat, while acidification (+2.7%) and land use (+1.5%) were slightly increased compared with the reference. The lower climate impact (without considering soil carbon change) was attributable to reduced fertilizer and diesel needs due to pre-crop effects. Overall, feeding grass-clover biomass decreased several environmental impact categories, feed-food competition and improved cereal-based cropping systems by the introduction of grass-clover leys.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Simple Summary Modern zoos aim to provide the best facilities possible for their animals, staff and visitors. Here, we present findings from a study focusing on the behaviour and visibility of four species pre- and post-translocation to a new environment, Islands, within Chester Zoo, UK: the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii), crested macaque (Macaca nigra), Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus) and the Malayan sun bear (Helarctos malayanus). We used full activity budgets to demonstrate that the move to new, custom-built facilities influenced the behaviour of all four species. Following relocation, both non-human primate species were found to spend more time interacting socially with group members and abnormal behaviours remained low for all four species. Malayan tapirs and crested macaques chose to spend more time in areas out of public view post-move, whilst Malayan sun bears were more visible to visitors in their new environment. We demonstrate the value of giving animals choice and control over how they interact with their surroundings, the importance in investment in behavioural monitoring throughout translocation events and add to the knowledge-base of this understudied area. Modern zoos strive to construct habitats which both enable and encourage animals to engage in species-specific behaviour, without compromising their visibility to visitors. Here, we present the findings of a within-zoo move to a custom-built exhibit (Islands at Chester Zoo, UK) with respect to the behaviour of four mammal species; the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii), crested macaque (Macaca nigra), Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus) and the Malayan sun bear (Helarctos malayanus). We used full activity budgets along with Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) to gain insight into how the move to a more naturalistic exhibit influenced behaviour. Engagement in abnormal behaviour remained low during the study period for all four species, suggesting no adverse responses to the change in environment. Following the move, both the non-human primate species spent more time engaged in positive social interactions with conspecifics, highlighting the importance of social support during enclosure moves. Time spent visible to the public was largely unaffected by the enclosure move for the Sumatran orangutan, whilst the movement to a new environment increased visibility for the Malayan sun bear and decreased visibility for the crested macaque and Malayan tapir. We demonstrate the value of monitoring behaviour throughout the translocation of zoo-housed species and outline the positive behavioral impacts of providing individuals with naturalistic, species-appropriate environments.

AB  - Early, strategic IPM actions can eradicate relatively new invasive conehead termite [Nasutitermes corniger (Motschulsky) (Blattodea: lsoptera: Termitidae)] populations, preventing negative economic and ecological consequences should this pest of agriculture, structures, and natural areas become permanently established and spread. Conspicuous foraging tunnels and above-ground nests are key aspects of N. corniger biology that render colonies vulnerable to discovery and elimination. Because the goal is eradication, the termites must be controlled wherever found-structure, yard, park, overgrown lot, orchard, forest, natural area, etc. Effective IPM methods exist to contain, control, and eradicate invasive nasutes. Removing and safely disposing dead plant material and stored wood helps reduce termite food and harborage, enables liquid insecticides to penetrate soil, and facilitates access for inspections. IPM involves a combination of physical interventions including nest destruction teamed with targeted insecticide applications, followed by diligent monitoring. Fumigation is required only in unusual situations. By killing colonies and reducing overall population size, alate (swarmer) dispersal can be reduced or eliminated, thus substantially slowing-with goal of halting-infested zone expansion. This paper details specific approaches, protocols, and recommendations for detection, treatment, transport prevention, and risk-based monitoring. We present practical suggestions regarding outreach, advocacy, partnerships with stakeholders, and networking with informed professionals. All recommendations stem from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services' invasive conehead termite program's best practices and lessons learned experiences during significant mitigation progress, with eradication of two populations of invasive coneheads that spread from a single introduction into Florida as an achievable goal.

AB  - Simple Summary Alpacas (Vicugna pacos) are South American members of the tribe Lamini of the Camelidae family. They are bred for their fiber, which is considered a luxury material. Interest in alpaca breeding is increasing in Poland, but the local alpaca population is relatively young and heterogeneous. The poor quality of alpaca fiber results from uncontrolled crossing with llamas (Lama glama). Hybridization between the two species is a well-known phenomenon among alpaca breeders worldwide and is the cause of poor fiber quality, which leads to economic losses. Microsatellite markers can distinguish alpacas from llamas and indicate the level of admixture. However, it is difficult to determine in which generation the admixture took place. The high genetic diversity of alpacas bred in Poland has emerged as a consequence of their mixed origins. In this context, the microsatellite markers recommended by the International Society for Animal Genetics have been shown to be highly useful for individual identification and parentage testing of alpacas. This study aimed to characterize the population structure and genetic diversity of alpacas maintained in Poland using 17 microsatellite markers recommended by the International Society for Animal Genetics. The classification of llamas, alpacas, and hybrids of both based on phenotype is often difficult due to long-term admixture. Our results showed that microsatellite markers can distinguish alpacas from llamas and provide information about the level of admixture of one species in another. Alpacas admixed with llamas constituted 8.8% of the tested individuals, with the first-generation hybrid displaying only 7.4% of llama admixture. The results showed that Poland hosts a high alpaca genetic diversity as a consequence of their mixed origin. More than 200 different alleles were identified and the average observed heterozygosity and expected heterozygosity values were 0.745 and 0.768, respectively, the average coefficient of inbreeding was 0.034, and the average polymorphism information content value was 0.741. The probability of exclusion for one parent was estimated at 0.99995 and for two parents at 0.99999.

AB  - One of the most rational and successful ways to mitigate the effects of wildlife disease is to perform proactive management efforts that can either prevent disease prior to first exposure or detect and eradicate disease prior to its establishment. However, estimating the risk of wildlife disease in new locations is often challenged by a lack of tractable linkages between known or presumed disease hazards and comprehensive risk of introduction and spread. In this study, we present a low-cost approach that estimated comprehensive risk of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Michigan, United States, based on the localized knowledge of experts and the use of existing datasets. We controlled for sources of expert bias, avoided group conflict that may challenge qualitative risk assessments, and generated estimates of risk that aligned with known positives and can be used in targeted surveillance and mitigation efforts. We found that 97% of CWD detections fell within high risk counties, with only 3 out of 117 cases (3%) falling in counties at low risk. Furthermore, we found coherence between indirect expert-elicited risk estimates and direct hazard rankings, suggesting that an indirect approach maximized expert knowledge sharing while controlling for sources of potential bias. Lastly, our approach required limited time commitment from group participants and thus, represented a low-cost decision-making approach. Taken together, our study may provide an opportunity to mount proactive wildlife disease management in a way that has often been promoted but rarely accomplished.

AB  - The laminarialean kelp Saccharina latissima is a common macroalga along rocky shorelines that is also frequently used in aquaculture. This study examined how ocean acidification may alter the growth of S. latissima as well as grazing on S. latissima by the gastropod Lacuna vincta. Under elevated nutrients, S. latissima experienced significantly enhanced growth at pCO(2) levels >= 1200 mu atm compared to ambient pCO(2) (similar to 400 mu atm). Elevated pCO(2) (>= 830 mu atm) also significantly reduced herbivory of L. vincta grazing on S. latissima relative to ambient pCO(2). There was no difference in grazing of S. latissima previously grown under elevated or ambient pCO(2), suggesting lowered herbivory was due to harm to the gastropods rather than alteration of the biochemical composition of the kelp. Decreased herbivory was specifically elicited when L. vincta were exposed to elevated pCO(2) in the absence of food for >= 18 h prior to grazing, with reduced grazing persisting 72 h. Elevated growth of S. latissima and reduced grazing by L. vincta at 1200 mu atm pCO(2) combined to increase net growth rates of S. latissima more than 4-fold relative to ambient pCO(2). L. vincta consumed 70% of daily production by S. latissima under ambient pCO(2) but only 38 and 9% at 800 and 1200 mu atm, respectively. Collectively, decreased grazing by L. vincta coupled with enhanced growth of S. latissima under elevated pCO(2) demonstrates that increased CO2 associated with climate change and/or coastal processes will dually benefit commercially and ecologically important kelps by both promoting growth and reducing grazing pressure.

AB  - Ant-plant interactions are widespread and have profound effects on plant fitness, food webs, and species diversity. Whereas most experimental work has tested for ant effects on herbivores, few studies have investigated ant effects on plant pathogens, and even less dual effects on herbivores and pathogens. In this work, we tested whether ants protect wild cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) plants against insect herbivores and fungal pathogens by means of an ant exclusion field experiment. In addition, we measured extrafloral nectar (EFN) traits (volume and concentration) to assess their role in ant attraction, and controlled for cotton direct chemical defenses (phenolics) in testing for ant-mediated defense. Ant exclusion did not have a detectable effect on either insect herbivory or pathogen infection levels on wild cotton leaves, and, accordingly, did not impact plant growth (height) over the growing season. We found that EFN traits were associated with ant recruitment to wild cotton plants, with both nectar amount and concentration being positively correlated with ant abundance on control plants. The above tests accounted for leaf phenolics, a type of direct defense, indicating no independent effect of indirect defense mediated by ants on wild cotton during the study. These results provide limited evidence of biotic defense by ants against insect and pathogens on wild cotton at the study site, but call for further assessments of spatiotemporal variation in wild cotton-ant interactions.

AB  - The dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) is a large ungulate that copes well with the xeric environment of the desert. Its peculiar adaptation to heat and dehydration is well-known. However, its behavior and general activity is far from being completely understood. The present study was carried out to investigate the ecological effect of the various seasons on the locomotor activity (LA) rhythm and diurnal activity of this species. Six adult female camels were maintained under mesic semi-natural conditions of the environment during four periods of 10 days in each season: autumn, winter, spring and summer. In addition, three female camels were used to test the effect of rain on the LA rhythm during a period of 18 days during the winter. The animal's LA was recorded using the locomotion scoring method. Camels displayed a clear 24.0h LA rhythm throughout the four seasons. Activity was intense during Day-time (6-22 fold higher in comparison to night) and dropped or completely disappeared during nighttime. Mean daytime total activity was significantly higher in the summer as compared to winter. Regardless of the season, the active phase in camels coincided with the time of the photophase and thermophase. Furthermore, the daily duration of the time spent active was directly correlated to the seasonal changes of photoperiod. The diurnal activity remained unchanged over the four seasons. For each season, the start and the end of the active phase were synchronized with the onset of sunrise and sunset. At these time periods, temperature remained incredibly stable with a change ranging from 0.002 to 0.210 degrees C; whereas, changes of light intensity were greater and faster with a change from 0.1 to 600 lux representing a variation of 3215-7192 fold in just 25-29 min. Rainfall affected the pattern of the LA rhythm with occurrence of abnormal nocturnal activity during nighttime disturbing nocturnal rest and sleep. Here we show that the dromedary camel exhibits significant seasonal changes of its activity within daylight hours. However, the diurnal pattern remains unchanged regardless of the season; whereas, abnormal nocturnal activity is observed during periods of rain. The activity onset and offset in this species seems to be primarily driven by the changes in light intensity at dusk and dawn.

AB  - Objective Hemoglobin is the iron-containing protein in the red blood cells of many animals. The primary function of hemoglobin is to transport oxygen from lung to tissues. It is composed of two identical alpha-globin subunits and two identical beta-globin subunits. . Hemoglobin has unique magnetic properties. The paramagnetism of deoxyhemoglobin, and the diamagnetism of oxyhemoglobin and carboxyhaemoglobin have been reported previously. Studies have also shown that external magnetic field affected blood flow rate, but whether magnetic field may affect the oxygenation rate of hemoglobin remains unknown. Here in this study, we are aiming to address this question with recombinant hemoglobin. Human hemoglobin and yak hemoglobin were selected as the research objects, and a recombinant protein expression and purification system was established to explore the magnetic field effects on the oxygenation rate of hemoglobin, as well as the differences in the oxygenation rate between human hemoglobin and yak hemoglobin under external magnetic field. Methods The recombinant expression and purification system of human and yak hemoglobin was established. The recombinant hemoglobin expression was further optimized and appropriated inducing temperature and IPTG concentration were screened. Recombinant human hemoglobin and yak hemoglobin were purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography and further by size-exclusion chromatography. SDS-PAGE was used to validate the purification, and UV-Vis spectrum and EPR were used to characterize the biochemical properties of recombinant hemoglobin. Deoxyhemoglobin of human and yak were placed under 0.3 T external magnetic field to test the magnetic field effects on oxygenation rate, and geomagnetic field condition was used as a sham control. The UV-Vis spectrum data were measured every 10 min, and the concentration and proportion of oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin were calculated to analyze the effects of magnetic field on the oxygenation rate of hemoglobin. The magnetic properties of human oxygenated hemoglobin and human deoxygenated hemoglobin have been measured by SQUID, a superconducting quantum interference magnetic measurement system. Three biological replications were performed for each experiment. The possible mechanism of the effect of magnetic field on the oxygenation rate of hemoglobin has been investigated and discussed. Results Human and yak hemoglobin were successfully expressed and purified by E. coli prokaryotic expression system. The optimal expression temperature was 30degree celsius, degree celsius , and the most suitable IPTG concentration was 1 mmol/L. EPR results suggested that trace amount of methemoglobin existed both in the purified human hemoglobin and yak hemoglobin proteins. The oxygenation rate of yak hemoglobin appeared to be faster than that of human hemoglobin, and the additional magnetic field treatment significantly increased the oxygenation rate of both human and yak hemoglobin, and yak hemoglobin was more sensitive to magnetic field than human hemoglobin. The paramagnetism of deoxyhemoglobin was verified by SQUID measurement. However, the diamagnetism of oxygenated hemoglobin remains uncertain, probably due to the presence of trace amount of methemoglobin in the sample of oxygenated hemoglobin, which was consistent with EPR results. Conclusion In this study, human and yak hemoglobin were successfully expressed and purified. The purified hemoglobin proteins have similar function and conformational states as native protein.
   External static magnetic field facilitates hemoglobin oxygenation, and yak hemoglobin seems more sensitive to magnetic field compared with human hemoglobin. These findings provide theoretical basis for the potential applications of applying magnetic field to improve hypoxia symptoms in clinical practice in the future.

AB  - Identification of conserved genomic sequences and their utilisation as anchor points for clade detection and/or characterisation is a mainstay in ecological studies. For environmental DNA (eDNA) assays, effective processing of large genomic datasets is crucial for reliable species detection in biodiversity monitoring. While considerable focus has been on developing robust species-targeted assays, eDNA assays with broader taxonomic coverage (e.g., detecting any species within a taxonomic group such as fish), can significantly streamline environmental monitoring, especially when detecting individual species' DNA proves challenging. Designing such assays requires identifying conserved regions representing the target taxonomic group, a chiefly manual task that is often labor-intensive and error-prone, particularly when working with large sequence datasets. To address these challenges, we present unikseq2, an enhanced, alignment-free, k-mer-based tool for identifying unique and conserved sequences. It introduces a new functionality to identify sequence conservation among target species, enabling more informed marker selection for applications such as universal primer design. This automates sequence selection in large-scale mitochondrial genome datasets eliminating the need for manual inspection of computationally costly multiple sequence alignments. Herein, we demonstrate unikseq2's capabilities by developing and validating eDNA assays for various taxa, including Osteichthyes (bony fishes), the Salmonidae family (salmon and trout), Myotis bats and Cervus deer. Unikseq2-based eDNA assays allow for accurate detection across multiple taxonomic levels, from genus to class, enhancing the flexibility, scalability and reliability of eDNA tools in environmental monitoring. By leveraging genomic data from public repositories, unikseq2 supports efficient, reproducible assay design, making it an invaluable tool for a wide range of ecological and biodiversity research applications.

AB  - Invasive mammalian predators have had a devastating effect on native species globally. The European red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is one such species where it has been introduced in Australia. A novel but unexplored tactic to reduce the impact of mammalian predators is the use of unrewarded prey odors to undermine the effectiveness of olfactory hunting behavior. To test the viability of unrewarded prey odors in an applied setting we investigated how foxes responded to the odors of three different prey species. We used the odors of two locally extinct native Australian marsupials; the eastern quoll (a smaller carnivore) and eastern bettong (a fungivore), and the European rabbit, an introduced herbivore. Conducting our research over a period of 3 weeks in a pastoral environment in South-eastern Australia, we used video observations of foxes' behaviors, as they encountered the different odors. We found a reduction in the number of fox visits to bettong odors in the third week. In contrast, we observed a sustained number of visits to rabbit odors. Foxes also spent more time investigating rabbit odors and displayed longer durations of vigilance behavior at quoll odors. Our results support the hypothesis that the exposure of wild foxes to unrewarded odors of novel prey species can reduce their interest in these odors, which might translate to a reduction in predation pressure. Our results also suggest, however, that olfactory pre-exposure may not be as effective at reducing fox interest in a competitor species' odor.

AB  - Invasive plants often benefit from a change in eco-evolutionary context, escaping the herbivores, pathogens, and competing plants from their native range. Introduced into na & iuml;ve native communities, invasive plants can spread rapidly, threatening native plant diversity and ecosystem functioning. Increasingly, studies have shown that native species sometimes adapt in response to the selection pressures imposed by an invasive plant. While researchers have periodically suggested using adapted native species in the management of invasive plants, the idea generally has not found its way to the field. Here, we (1) compare the concept to the more established practices of assisted migration, classic biological control, and microbiome engineering; (2) discuss some of the hurdles to practical implementation; and (3) outline directions for further research that would help expose the role of native adaptations in shaping the trajectory of plant invasions.

AB  - Implementing effective conservation measures to manage migratory populations is challenging, especially in a relatively inaccessible dynamic environment such as the ocean. With limited financial and human resources, efforts must be intelligently prioritized to achieve conservation success and reduce uncertainties of conservation efforts. The southwest Indian Ocean (SWIO) hosts some of the world's most important breeding grounds for the Critically Endangered hawksbill turtle Eretmochelys imbricata. However, knowledge gaps remain about the movement patterns of this species. Between 2007 and 2022, we deployed 17 satellite tags onto hawksbill turtles from scattered locations in the SWIO: 16 nesting females-Granitic Islands, Seychelles (n = 9); north Madagascar (n = 5); Moheli, Comoros (n = 1); Juan de Nova, Terres australes et antarctiques francaises (n = 1)-and 1 female bycaught in fisheries (east Madagascar). We found strong variability in migratory movements amongst individuals, particularly in terms of distance and movement persistence. Detailed analysis of movement persistence reveals that these individuals behave differently in neritic and oceanic habitats, with a lower movement persistence in neritic habitats. We identified a total of 12 foraging areas scattered throughout the SWIO, both in coastal and open-sea neritic habitats. These results reinforce the need to consider the importance of neritic habitats, for both migration and foraging, in conservation policies. The quantification of the degree of migratory variability is particularly important to developing conservation plans and strategies at both the national and international level, including the delineation of regional management units (RMUs) in the Indian Ocean.

AB  - Simple Summary There are few reports on local pig breeds in Guizhou province. In this work, the population structure, genetic diversity, and selection characteristics of three foreign pig breeds and seven Guizhou local pig breeds were studied. Principal component analysis, adjacent tree analysis, and ADMIXTURE analysis showed that Chinese and Western pig breeds had different ancestral sources. Jianhe White Xiang pig (JHBX) had a distant genetic relationship with the other six local pig breeds in Guizhou province and had unique genetic characteristics. The genetic diversity of the JHBX population was low, and the genetic diversity of the remaining six Chinese native pig populations was generally at a moderate level. In addition, we also screened the candidate genes that affect the coat color phenotype of pigs in Guizhou province through selection signals. Our findings will advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying these germplasm characteristics.Abstract The local pig breeds in Guizhou possess exceptional meat quality, robust adaptability, and resilience to harsh feeding conditions, making them ideal for producing high-quality pork. With over 10 local pig breeds in the region, we focused on 7 specific breeds: Baixi pigs (BX), Congjiang Xiang pigs (CJX), Guanling pigs (GL), Jianhe White Xiang pigs (JHBX), Jiangkou Luobo pigs (JKLB), Kele pigs (KL), and Qiandong Hua pigs (QDH). Unfortunately, these breeds face threats such as introduced species and inbreeding, resulting in a decline in population size and numbers. To better protect and utilize these breeds, we employed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to investigate the population structure, genetic diversity, and selection characteristics of 283 pigs across these seven breeds. Our findings revealed distinct ancestral sources between Chinese and Western pig breeds, as demonstrated by principal component analysis, adjacent tree analysis, and ADMIXTURE analysis. Notably, JHBX exhibited a distant genetic relationship from the other six local pig breeds in Guizhou province, showcasing unique genetic characteristics. While the genetic diversity of the six Chinese native pig populations, excluding JHBX, was generally moderate in Guizhou province, the JHBX population displayed low genetic diversity. Therefore, it is imperative to intensify selection efforts to prevent inbreeding decline in JHBX while further enhancing the protection measures for the other six pig populations. Additionally, we identified candidate genes influencing the size disparity among pigs in Guizhou province through signal selection. Our study outcomes serve as a reference for developing effective conservation and utilization plans for pig breeds in Guizhou province and deepen our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying pig body size.

AB  - The consequences of the introduction of invasive plants for the diet of herbivorous insects have been little explored in nature where, potentially, abiotic and biotic factors operate. In this study, we examined the larval performance of two Neotropical Danaini butterflies when using either a native or an exotic Apocynaceae species as host plant in both field and laboratory experiments. Hosts greatly differ in their amount of latex exudation and other physicochemical traits, as well as in the amount of evolutionary time they have interacted with herbivores. First, herbivore performance on the hosts was investigated under laboratory conditions. Larvae of both Danaini species took more time to develop on the exotic host; larval survivorship did not vary between hosts. Second, first instar survivorship on both hosts was evaluated in two field sites, one site per host. To do so, in both sites half of the larvae were bagged (protected against both abiotic and biotic factors) while the remainder were nonbagged (exposed). The interaction between larval exposure with the use of the exotic host reduced larval survival. We concluded that the combined effects of host plant traits and abiotic factors reduced survival of herbivores in field conditions. Therefore, the performance of herbivores when using hosts of different origins should be considered together with the multiple ecological factors found in natural environments, as these factors can modify the result of plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - The West African giraffe is restricted to Niger, but historically it inhabited much of the Sudano-Sahelian zone. The population is concentrated in the 'Giraffe Zone' (GZ), an unprotected area with a high human population density. Since the mid-1990s, the giraffe population has steadily increased mainly due to the collective social and conservation initiatives of the government, non-governmental organizations and the local community. In 2018, the first West African giraffe satellite population was established through the reintroduction of eight individuals into Gadabedji Biosphere Reserve (GBR). In this study, we aimed to describe the current state of human-giraffe coexistence, human attitudes towards giraffe and human habits of natural resources use through a questionnaire survey conducted in the GZ and GBR. Although most of the GZ respondents highlighted crop damage caused by giraffe, we also found overall positive attitudes towards the animals. Most respondents from both sites expressed positive attitudes towards giraffe, highlighting that they do not see poaching as a major current threat. However, the giraffe population continues to be directly threatened by habitat loss through firewood cutting, livestock overgrazing and agriculture expansion. Long-term conservation of the West African giraffe is dependent on better habitat protection and understanding of current human-giraffe coexistence through ensuring that giraffe presence will benefit local communities across their range.

AB  - Biotic resistance from native consumers can reduce the abundance and impacts of introduced species. Previous studies documented the escape of the introduced alga Kappaphycus alvarezii from abandoned farms in Bocas del Toro, Panama. Both attached and unattached aggregations of this invasive alga accumulated on and smothered native corals and seagrasses. However, native urchins and parrotfish were also observed feeding on the alga in the field suggesting that native herbivores may act as agents of biotic resistance. In this study, we conducted an herbivore-exclusion experiment in the field to determine the effect of native herbivory on K. alvarezii and a laboratory experiment to measure the rate of herbivory on the introduced alga by two common native urchins (Lytechinus variegatus and Echinometra lucunter). Consistent with the biotic resistance hypothesis, native herbivores rapidly consumed algae in both field and lab studies. Loss of algal biomass was approximately nine times higher in herbivore-exposed treatments than in herbivore-exclusion treatments in the field. Lab experiments revealed L. variegatus ate 3.5 times more algae than E. lucunter. While K. alvarezii was abundant in surveys during 2014, we did not detect any remaining individuals in our field sites during a return visit one year later. Thus, both native urchins consume K. alvarezii and, along with other herbivores, are likely important agents of biotic resistance. However, longer-term studies are needed to test if native herbivores can control the introduced algae still escaping from active farms.

AB  - Abalone is one of the most important small-scale fisheries in Mexico and is challenged by multiple stressors. For example, the loss of the native main food, Macrocystis pyrifera, and the subsequent takeover of non-indigenous algae species represent a major threat to abalone growth and survival. In Baja California, Mexico two introduced macroalgae, Undaria pinnatifida and Sargassum horneri have become common in the past decade with unknown consequences on native herbivores. In this work, we explored the effect of these invasive algae on the growth and survival of juvenile red abalone, Haliotis rufescens. One hundred and ten juvenile red abalone were tagged and fed with invasive algae U. pinnatifida and S. horneri, and a control with M. pyrifera. Then, the shell length, body weight, and survivorship were assessed monthly for 90 days. Results show that abalone fed U. pinnatifida had a total growth in length, weight, and survivorship, similar to those fed native M. pyrifera. In contrast, abalone fed S. horneri had significantly lower overall performance. Marine heatwaves and other climatic impacts are expected to favour the establishment of invasive species. These results may be relevant to inform local fisheries and management efforts in this area under future scenarios.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal neurological disease of cervids caused by a misfolded protein with no vaccines or other cures to prevent infection and death. In the past decade, CWD has been recognized as one of the 10 most important challenges facing wildlife management. This paper evaluates the temporal and spatial patterns of CWD prevalence in southern Wisconsin white-tailed deer during the past 20 years. In most CWD areas, prevalence progresses from introduction to enzootic equilibrium in 15-20 years. In some monitoring areas, the disease grows at a much slower rate and remains below the equilibrium levels. Outbreaks are characterized by four distinct epizootic stages. Disease establishment (Stage 1) depends on the distance from a CWD focus. High rates of incidence and prevalence growth (Stage 2) are followed by slower growth as the relative number of susceptible deer declines (Stage 3). The rate of prevalence increase over time is higher in more forested ecoregions and in males (0.48 vs. 0.43) but similar in females (0.43 vs. 0.37) and yearlings (0.44 vs. 0.39). Habitat features, acting as surrogates for deer behavior and contact, may affect the rate of prevalence growth at a landscape (ecoregion) scale. Additionally, prevalence may be affected by deer management practices that favor higher deer abundance and more mature males. Finally, enzootic equilibrium (Stage 4) is higher in males (0.5), followed by females (0.36) and then yearlings (0.26). These equilibrium prevalence levels are high enough to have significant population impacts, reduce the abundance of mature males, and facilitate CWD spread by infected yearlings. Epizootic patterns suggest that CWD transmission has been frequency-dependent and primarily driven by direct contact with infected deer. Evidence for a meaningful change in the epizootic pattern from a 10-year management program to reduce deer abundance is lacking. The trajectory of CWD dynamics in Wisconsin suggests rapid growth in regional prevalence following introduction and increased spread across the landscape.

AB  - Benthic foraminifera are unicellular marine micro-organism with a hard exoskeleton and commonly present in the benthic community of marine ecosystem. This study aimed to identify the benthic foraminifera present along the coastal areas of eight municipalities in Biliran Island, Philippines. Quadrat sampling was conducted and three samples per quadrant transect of 1 m x 1 m divided into nine squares were collected. The samples were then observed under the microscope, and the specimens seen were identified by comparing them with the images of the sample species from the website https://marinespecies.org/. The researchers conducted an in-situ collection of the foraminiferal shells from intertidal areas along shallow water coastlines of the island. Results showed that the coastal environment of Biliran Island has the presence of the genera Spirillina, Quinqueloculina, Marginopora and Sorites. The identified species were classified based on their feeding mechanisms as herbivory and passive suspension feeding. The presence of benthic foraminifera species along the coastal environments of Biliran Island provides a record of the environment where they are found, making them natural bioindicators of water quality. This study provides a baseline for further studies on the distribution and abundance of benthic foraminifera in the area and can contribute to the understanding of the environmental conditions of the coastal areas in Biliran Island.

AB  - Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) play a pivotal role in the Southern Ocean as wide-ranging marine predators and major prey consumers within Southern Ocean marine ecosystems. Due to their circumpolar distribution and the remoteness of their habitat, large uncertainties remain about their total population sizes. This is especially true for elephant seal populations in the French Southern Territories in the southern Indian Ocean (i.e. Crozet and Kerguelen Archipelagos) as many breeding sites are inaccessible for ground censuses. Here, we present a simple and efficient approach for estimating the total elephant seal populations of the Kerguelen and Crozet Archipelagos by using very high-resolution satellite imagery (<1m resolution). Twenty-eight satellite images taken during the breeding season to count female elephant seals in inaccessible areas were used and complemented the traditional annual ground counts in accessible areas. For Kerguelen Island sectors likely to host colonies and where no satellite images were available for the breeding season, a statistical predictive model was built to estimate the most likely number of breeding females to be present on a given beach according to its physiographic characteristics. Our results show the reliability of using very high-resolution satellite images, a relatively low-cost platform, to count pinniped populations and provide the first estimation of the total southern elephant seal population for both the Kerguelen 347,995 (s e = 4,950) and Crozet 13,065 (s e = 169) Archipelagos. The combined total represents over 35% of the global elephant seal population with the Kerguelen stock being numerically equivalent to the South Georgia stock. In addition, we re-examined the population trends since the last mid-century for Kerguelen and over the last five decades for Crozet. The demographic trends of the southern Indian Ocean populations show marked growth over the last decade (5.1% and 1.6% annual growth rate for Crozet and Kerguelen respectively), particularly on Crozet where the elephant seal population has more than tripled.

AB  - Increasing evidence has shown that introducing broadleaved trees into coniferous plantations can regulate hydrologic stores and fluxes; however, the effects and regulatory mechanisms of species mixing on the water conservation capacity of the litter-soil continuum remain poorly understood, and differences among tree species may appear. Herein, we investigated and compared the water conservation capacity of the litter layer (semi-decomposed and decomposed layer) and soil layer (0-100 cm) in a monoculture plantation (Pinus massoniana) and five mixed plantations (Pinus massoniana mixed with Cercidiphyllum japonicum, Manglietia chingii, Camellia oleifera, Michelia maudiae, and Bretschneidera sinensis) and comprehensively considered their potential influencing factors. We discovered that the identity of broadleaved tree species significantly affected the water storage of litter and soil in the mixed plantations (p < 0.05). The effective water-holding capacity of the litter (13.39 t center dot ha(-1)) was low due to the coniferous litter's simple structure and challenging breakdown, despite the fact that the litter stock of the monoculture plantation was substantially larger than that of the mixed plantation (14.72 t center dot ha(-1)). Introducing deep-rooted tree species (e.g., Bretschneidera sinensis and Camellia oleifera) into Pinus massoniana farmsteads improved the soil-pore structure and aggregate stability, thereby significantly increasing the 0-100 cm soil water storage. Furthermore, we found that litter storage, soil organic carbon, and litter thickness, as key influencing factors, have complex effects on the water storage of the litter-soil continuum. Generally, these findings demonstrated that mixed plantations can potentially improve the water conservation capacity of the litter-soil system. Nevertheless, special attention should be given to the complementarity between tree species combinations.

AB  - Rhinoceroses are among the most endangered mammalian species today. Their past diversity is well documented from the Eocene onward, although their evolutionary history is far from being fully understood. Here, we elucidate the systematic affinities of a Pleistocene rhinoceros species represented by a partial skeleton from 709 +/- 68 kya archaeological deposits in Luzon Island, Philippines. We perform a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, including all living species and a wide array of extinct rhinocerotid species. We confirm the early split between Elasmotheriinae and Rhinocerotinae at c. 35.5 Mya and constrain the divergence between recent Asian and African rhinoceroses at c. 24 Mya, with contrasting phenotypic evolutionary rates in Diceroti and Rhinoceroti. Dental features reveal the existence of an unsuspected Asian Pleistocene clade, referred to as Nesorhinus gen. nov.. It includes the rhinoceros from the Philippines and another extinct species from Taiwan, N. hayasakai. Nesorhinus is the sister-group to a cluster comprising Dicerorhinus and Rhinoceros. Our phylogenetic results strongly suggest an island-hopping dispersal for Nesorhinus, from the Asian mainland towards Luzon via Taiwan by the Late Miocene or later, and Pleistocene dispersals for representatives of Rhinoceros. Nesorhinus philippinensis would be the first perissodactyl species supporting the island-rule hypothesis, with decreased body weight and limb-bone robustness.

AB  - Understanding how and why livestock choose to graze on pasture can provide valuable information to farmers, such as overall pasture use, foraging patterns, and behavior trends. This information may be used to further assist farmers in making management decisions on how to increase production. This study specifically aimed to understand what the important drivers of grazing were, such as landscape attributes (pasture quality, distance to trees, distance to fences, distance to water) and climatic variables (rainfall, temperature), in paddocks comprising either native or improved/introduced grass species, in the Monaro region of SE Australia. Pasture quality was a highly important and a significant variable, along with temperature and elevation for the improved pasture paddock, in contrast to the native paddock, where in addition to elevation and temperature, near distance to trees was more important in determining sheep location. Results from research such as this can provide valuable insights into various grazing behaviors of sheep and also assist in shaping the sustainable management of sheep.Monitoring livestock allows insights to graziers on valuable information such as spatial distribution, foraging patterns, and animal behavior, which can significantly improve the management of livestock for optimal production. This study aimed to understand what potential variables are significant for predicting where sheep spent the most time in native (NP) and improved (IP) paddocks. Wethers (castrated male sheep) were tracked using Global Positioning System (GPS) collars on 15 sheep in the IP and 15 in the NP, respectively, on a property located in the Monaro region of Southern New South Wales, Australia. Trials were performed over four six-day periods in April, July, and November of 2014 and March in 2015. Data were analyzed to understand various trends that may have occurred during different seasons, using random forest models (RFMs). Of the factors investigated, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was significant (p < 0.01) and highly important for wethers in the IP, but not the NP, suggesting that quality of pasture was key for wethers in the IP. Elevation, temperature, and near distance to trees were important and significant for predicting residency of wethers in the IP, as well as the NP. The result of this study highlights the ability of predictive models to provide insights on behavior-based modelling of GPS data and further enhance current knowledge about location-based choices of sheep on paddocks.

KW  - RHINCODON-TYPUS
AB  - Non-invasive video tracking offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative to invasive tagging for studying marine megafauna movement. However, its potential with brief footage remains underexplored. This pilot study presents a preliminary application of the method using a 24-s video of a whale shark (Rhincodon typus) near Abu Musa Island in the Persian Gulf on October 10, 2023. Due to the short duration and single-individual observation, findings are exploratory and intended to demonstrate feasibility rather than establish generalizable conclusions. Using VideoTracker software and Python tools (OpenCV, NumPy), we tracked a 4-m-long shark swimming at 5 m depth, covering 19.25 m over 24 s with speeds ranging from 0.51 to 1.16 m/s (mean 0.78 +/- 0.19 m/s) and an energy expenditure of 0.66 units. The near-linear trajectory (sinuosity 1.07) suggests steady cruising, consistent with efficient locomotion and prior speed-based movement analyses. This proof-of-concept highlights the potential of video-based tracking in resource-limited contexts and encourages its further refinement for broader ecological applications.

AB  - Rhododendron eastmanii is a species endemic to South Carolina and common in the Enoree Ranger District of the Sumter National Forest. A four-year study was undertaken to revisit known populations and to locate new populations. A total of 2,035 individuals in 38 populations were documented, including 663 seedlings, 705 non-flowering adults, and 667 flowering individuals. Plants were most commonly found on mature hardwood slopes above headwater streams. Pollinator visitors included eastern tiger swallowtail (Papilio glaucus), pipevine swallowtail (Battus philenor), and bumblebees (Bombus spp.). Concerns for the future of the species were noted due to deer browsing and subcanopy shading, especially from Acer leucoderme (a native tree) and Elaeagnus umbellata (an introduced shrub). This survey results in a better understanding of the species distribution and documents its demographic changes over time.

AB  - Simple Summary The genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among wild boars in major regions of the world were assessed using genome-wide data from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), southern and northern regions of China, Europe, Northeast Asia, and Southeast Asia. We clarified the close phylogenetic relationship of QTP wild boars with those in southern China. In addition, genome-wide selection signal analysis based on cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity, fixation index parameters, and run of homozygosity island recognition technology was performed to obtain a series of candidate genes related to the plateau adaptability of wild boar, such as TSC2, TELO2, VCP, SLC5A1, and SLC5A4. In particular, SLC5A1 and SLC5A4 are involved in glucose homeostasis and may be the key to the plateau adaptability of wild boars. This study enhances our understanding of the genetic mechanism of high-altitude adaptation in wild boars.Abstract The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) wild boar is an excellent model for investigating high-altitude adaptation. In this study, we analyzed genome-wide data from 93 wild boars compiled from various studies worldwide, including the QTP, southern and northern regions of China, Europe, Northeast Asia, and Southeast Asia, to explore their phylogenetic patterns and high-altitude adaptation based on genome-wide selection signal analysis and run of homozygosity (ROH) estimation. The findings demonstrate the alignment between the phylogenetic associations among wild boars and their geographical location. An ADMIXTURE analysis indicated a relatively close genetic relationship between QTP and southern Chinese wild boars. Analyses of the fixation index and cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity between populations revealed 295 candidate genes (CDGs) associated with high-altitude adaptation, such as TSC2, TELO2, SLC5A1, and SLC5A4. These CDGs were significantly overrepresented in pathways such as the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and Fanconi anemia pathways. In addition, 39 ROH islands and numerous selective CDGs (e.g., SLC5A1, SLC5A4, and VCP), which are implicated in glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function, were discovered in QTP wild boars. This study not only assessed the phylogenetic history of QTP wild boars but also advanced our comprehension of the genetic mechanisms underlying the adaptation of wild boars to high altitudes.

AB  - We used meta-analyses to compare the effects of 44 single insect species used as biocontrol agents against invasive weeds with the effects of 51 species of non-biocontrol insects on native plants. The effects of biocontrol insects on plant morphometrics were stronger than those of non-biocontrol insects. Overall effects of both groups together were significantly different across plant growth forms with grasses, shrubs, and trees impacted more than vines and herbs. The effect of plant organ was also significant, with roots and fruits suffering the greatest impacts. Insect order had a significant effect: Hemiptera and Coleoptera showed strong effects and Diptera weak effects. Insect feeding guild had significant effects with leaf chewers, sap suckers, stem borers, and stem gallers having the strongest effects. There were no significant effects of study duration or latitude of location. For most categories of plant growth form, plant organ attacked, insect order and feeding guild, biocontrol insects had significantly stronger effects than their non-biocontrol counterparts. The effects of non-biocontrol insects grouped alone against native plants were not always a reliable guideline for how biocontrol insects grouped alone affected their target plants.

AB  - Management and policy decisions regarding biological invasions and other aspects of global change such as the changing climate have the potential to influence one another. Recently, interest in harvest as an invasive species management strategy has surged. Researchers have speculated about the potential positive (e.g. population and impact reduction, economic losses recouped through new profits) and negative (e.g. generation of economic incentives to encourage further introductions) consequences of such management strategies, but few experimental analyses exist despite the fact that real-world 'experiments' in harvesting invasive species continue to accrue. We provide the first comprehensive list of the many ways humankind has adapted to the presence of invasive species through harvest, and we consider trends that emerge from this list. The spectrum types range from collection of feral invasive populations to cultivation of potential invaders as crops, and harvested invasive species serve a variety of purposes ranging from biofuels to foods. We caution that the costs of invasion and benefit from harvest can be difficult to quantify, and this difficulty is compounded by the fact that costs and benefits are often incurred by different stakeholders. Climate and other aspects of global change accompanying invasive species harvest were rarely taken into account, and we recommend that climate effects of invasive species harvest become an explicit consideration of harvest strategies moving forward. Overall, we conclude that ecologists, economists, environmental managers and stakeholders must work together to ensure successful and responsible application of ongoing harvests and inform future efforts.

AB  - BackgroundWoolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) is a typical indicator of cold-stage climate that was widely distributed in Northern Hemisphere during the Middle-Late Pleistocene. Although a plethora of fossils have been excavated from Northern China, their phylogenetic status, intraspecific diversity and phylogeographical structure are still vague.ResultsIn the present study, we generated four mitogenomes from Late Pleistocene woolly rhinoceros in Northern China and compared them with published data. Bayesian and network analyses indicate that the analyzed individuals contain at least four maternal haplogroups, and Chinese samples fall in three of them. One of our samples belongs to a previously unidentified early diverging clade (haplogroup D), which separated from other woolly rhinoceros around 0.57 Ma (95% CI: 0.76-0.41 Ma). The timing of this clade's origin coincides with the first occurrence of woolly rhinoceros, which are thought to have evolved in Europe. Our other three samples cluster in haplogroup C, previously only identified from one specimen from Wrangel Island (ND030) and initially considered to be an isolated clade. Herein, our findings suggest that ND030 is likely descended from a northward dispersal of the individuals carrying haplogroup C from Northern China. Additionally, Chinese woolly rhinoceros specimens exhibit higher nucleotide diversity than those from Siberia.ConclusionOur findings highlight Northern China as a possible refugium and a key evolution center of the Pleistocene woolly rhinoceros.

AB  - Marine top predators are expected to adjust their foraging behaviour at multiple time scales concomitantly with changes in forage fish availability. Rhinoceros auklets Cerorhinca monocerata rearing chicks at Teuri Island, Japan Sea, fed on anchovy Engraulis japonicus in 2012 and 2013 (anchovy regime) but switched to sand lance Ammodytes spp in 2019 and 2020 (sand lance regime). Here, we studied their at-sea behaviour using the GPS locations of 33 birds and the depth-acceleration records of 26 birds, and compared their foraging behaviour between these prey regimes. At the trip scale, auklets used offshore waters (> 50 m sea depth) and coastal waters in the anchovy regime but used mainland coastal waters (< 50 m sea depth) in the sand lance regime. In the sand lance regime, the birds also conducted more overnight 2- to 4-day trips in 2020 and spent more time flying during 1-day trips as they fed in further areas compared to the anchovy regime. At the dive scale, auklets frequently dove to both < 5 m and 20-30 m depths in the anchovy regime but mainly to < 5 m depth in the sand lance regime. Within each dive, auklets showed a greater number of fast/strong wing stroke events in the anchovy regime than in the sand lance regime. These changes in auklet behaviour reflected the different habitats, depth distribution, and swim speed of the targeted prey species. Our study shows the behavioural flexibility of a wing-propelled flying-diving seabird in response to the inter-annual shifts in the dominant forage fish community. It also indicates the ecological constraints on the mechanisms determining nest productivity in this day-foraging/night-provisioning seabird.

AB  - Coastal systems encompass a range of ecotones that are important for fish species, providing diverse micro-habitats and grounds for foraging, protection from predation, reproduction and areas for recruitment. However, most of these systems face major threats from human activities. Considering the increasing levels of human disturbance in coastal ecosystems, understanding fish-habitat associations may provide important insights into patterns of species occurrence and distribution in human-impacted systems, which can support the development of effective conservation and management measures. In this context, we investigated the relationship between seahorses (Hippocampus reidi) and both habitat complexity and different holdfast species, to determine possible variation between locations and among seasons. Data were obtained from the rocky reefs of Guanabara (Urca Beach) and Sepetiba (Duas Irm & atilde;s Island) bays, in southeastern Brazil. Seahorses were counted, and the holdfast being used by each individual was recorded and identified to species or assigned to a morphofunctional group. The beaches differed in holdfast composition and morphofunctional groups, yet sharing some morphofunctional groups. Seahorses were more frequently associated with branching holdfasts at both sites, and also with foliaceous and massive. Association with algae were particularly found in Urca, while the coral Carijoa riisei in Duas Irm & atilde;s Island.

AB  - Understanding the impact of hunting on wildlife is necessary to protect biodiversity in remote, endangered ecosystems, where rural communities depend on bushmeat as sources of food and income. Unsustainable hunting has led to a major decline in mammal population densities across Africa, especially for ungulates and primates. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify the impact of hunting on lesula (Cercopithecus lomamiensis), a semiterrestrial and poorly known monkey in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and (2) assess the species' relative abundance in the context of its behavioral ecology and local hunting practices. We compared the relative abundance of lesula to prey species preferred by hunters using data collected from camera trap surveys (5,960 days) and primate vocalization surveys (n = 174) and assessed species-specific hunting pressure in the buffer zone using data collected from surveillance patrols (2,255 km), hunter follows (n = 16), and semistructured interviews (n = 21). We found that the abundance of terrestrial mammal and primate species was negatively impacted by hunting in the buffer zone, but the abundance of lesula appeared relatively similar throughout its range. Our results suggest that the relative tolerance of lesula in the buffer zone was associated with its ecological niche and the specific behavior of local hunters. Lesula is a threatened, endemic monkey of the Congo Basin rainforest, and this study provides data to enable its continuous monitoring and long-term population management. Some primate populations, such as lesula, may be able to persist under specific conditions despite being subject to high hunting pressure.

AB  - Tropical macroalgae serve importance ecological roles on coral reefs but can supplant corals in phase shifts as shown worldwide. Thus, it is important to understand their fundamental photophysiology and effects on calcification mechanisms. We examined organic delta C-13, inorganic CaCO3 delta C-13 and delta O-18, and organic %C, %N, C:N of abundant macroalgae on Little Cayman Island (LCI) reefs across a broad light gradient (5-2,000 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)). We hypothesized that LCI macroalgae utilize greater CO2 in low light environments as carbon concentration mechanisms (CCMs) to take up HCO3- have high energetic costs. We proposed that calcification mechanisms are also influenced by light and Ci-use strategies. LCI macroalgae had organic delta C-13 values (-12% to -25%) indicative of CCMs and exhibited only a 1-3% delta C-13 depletion under irradiances < 5 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). Light and phyla were significant in a mixed model explaining similar to 80% of variance in organic delta C-13. Organic delta C-13 was a weak predictor and light insignificant in explaining inorganic delta C-13 values of thalli carbonates. Biogenic carbonate delta C-13 values were taxa-specific based on cluster analysis of delta C-13:delta d(18)O ratios, an indication of diverse calcification mechanisms. LCI macroalgal photosynthesis utilized CCMs across a broad range of irradiances, thus greater CO2 availability under ocean acidification is not likely to enhance community dominance of macroalgae of concern (e.g., Lobophora sp.) due to shifts in photophysiology. The mechanisms of Ci sequestration for photosynthesis appeared to be mostly uncoupled from calcification mechanisms that were diverse across phyla, likely due to distinct macroalgal forms, sites of calcification and carbonate structure.

AB  - Attempts to deter elephants from entering crop fields and human settlements in Africa have used various barriers (e.g. electric fences, chilli fences, beehive fences or plant barriers), situated on or very near the boundaries of fields or villages, with rather variable success. We explored a very simple new barrier concept based upon re-arranging the layout of foreign stimuli already known to arouse suspicion and fear among elephants. Deterrence involved deploying unnaturally scented objects on and across their pathways of habitual movement leading to crop field clusters. Elephants are suspicious of unpleasant olfactory stimuli, like string or cloth saturated with pungent-smelling chilli oil, old engine oil, or creosote and dislike 'chilli smoke'. Foreign visual items like plastic bottles, reflective metal strips and cow bells possibly reinforced suspicion of these unpleasant scents and influenced the deterrent effect. These flimsy items deployed over very short distances merely acted as a bluff to 'problem elephants' that people were actively trying to impede their progress, and the vast majority chose to turn back or deviate substantially. Thus we coined the term a 'soft virtual boundary'. We demonstrate that placing virtual boundaries away from village and agricultural lands, forces elephants to encounter them upon leaving their daytime refuges, while still in natural habitat. The suspicion and fear generated here considerably reduces elephants' determination to proceed onwards to risk crop raiding. When multiple, small virtual boundaries are strategically moved around at intervals, a 'virtual fence dynamic' delivers an enduring deterrent effect. In ten study areas in two countries over seven years this technique led to considerable and consistent reductions in crop damage levels of up to 95% in places. Because these methods (i) completely rely on local knowledge, (ii) were exceptionally low cost and (iii) demonstrated rapid results, the 'buy-in' from affected communities of small-scale subsistence farmers was immediate and very enthusiastic. So this strategy has the potential to remove the most intractable stumbling block to the sustainability of human-elephant conflict mitigation efforts in smallholder agriculture - reliance upon conservation donor funding for very costly and problematic mitigation measures like fencing, compensation schemes and elephant translocations.

AB  - Biological control of weeds involves deliberate introduction of host-specific natural enemies into invaded range to reduce the negative impacts of invasive species. Assessing the specificity is a crucial step, as introduction of generalist natural enemies into a new territory may pose risks to the recipient communities. A mechanistic understanding of host use can provide valuable insights for the selection of specialist natural enemies, bolster confidence in non-target risk assessment and potentially accelerate the host specificity testing process in biological control. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of studies on the genomics of host specialization with a view to examine if genomic signatures can help predict host specificity in insects. Focusing on phytophagous Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Diptera, we compared chemosensory receptors and enzymes between "specialist" (insects with narrow host range) and "generalist" (insects with wide host range) insects. The availability of genomic data for biological control agents (natural enemies of weeds) is limited thus our analyses utilized data from pest insects and model organisms for which genomic data are available. Our findings revealed that specialists generally exhibit a lower number of chemosensory receptors and enzymes compared with their generalist counterparts. This pattern was more prominent in Coleoptera and Diptera relative to Lepidoptera. This information can be used to reject agents with large gene repertoires to potentially accelerate the risk assessment process. Similarly, confirming smaller gene repertoires in specialists could further strengthen the risk evaluation. Despite the distinctive signatures between specialists and generalists, challenges such as finite genomic data for biological control agents, ad hoc comparisons, and fewer comparative studies among congeners limit our ability to use genomic signatures to predict host specificity. A few studies have empirically compared phylogenetically closely related species, enhancing the resolution and the predictive power of genomics signatures thus suggesting the need for more targeted studies comparing congeneric specialists and generalists.

AB  - Compared with their free-ranging counterparts, wild animals in captivity experience different conditions with lasting physiological and behavioural effects. Although shifts in gene expression are expected to occur upstream of these phenotypes, we found no previous gene expression comparisons of captive versus free-ranging mammals. We assessed gene expression profiles of three brain regions (cortex, olfactory bulb and hippocampus) of wild shrews (Sorex araneus) compared with shrews kept in captivity for two months and undertook sample dropout to examine robustness given limited sample sizes. Consistent with captivity effects, we found hundreds of differentially expressed genes in all three brain regions, 104 overlapping across all three, that enriched pathways associated with neurodegenerative disease, oxidative phosphorylation and genes encoding ribosomal proteins. In the shrew, transcriptomic changes detected under captivity resemble responses in several human pathologies, including major depressive disorder and neurodegeneration. While interpretations of individual genes are tempered by small sample sizes, we propose captivity influences brain gene expression and function and can confound analyses of natural processes in wild individuals under captive conditions.

AB  - Seed dispersal is a critical process for plant reproduction and regeneration. Successful recruitment depends on pre- and post-dispersal processes that complete a seed's journey until becoming a new plant. However, anthropogenic stressors may disrupt the seed dispersal process at some stages, collapsing plant regeneration and hampering its long-term persistence. The Chilean palm tree Jubaea chilensis is the southernmost and the only non-tropical palm species, which currently relies on the scatter-hoarding rodent Octodon degus for seed dispersal. We assessed seed fate by measuring predation and dispersal rates through experimental fieldwork in the Palmar de Ocoa site (located within La Campana National Park) and the Palmar El Salto. We also used previous reports on seed harvest and seedling herbivory to depict the whole J. chilensis seed dispersal process and assess the relative importance of different anthropogenic pressures. We asked the following questions: (1) What is the effect of human harvesting on J. chilensis recruitment? (2) Do native and exotic rodents predate J. chilensis seeds in the same way? and (3) Does post-dispersal herbivory matter? We found that J. chilensis fruits are harvested for human consumption, reducing pre-dispersal available seeds by removing about 23 tons per season. Then, post-dispersal seeds at the Ocoa palm grove are heavily predated by exotic (Rattus rattus) and native (Octodon spp.) rodents; only 8.7% of the seeds are effectively dispersed by Octodon degus. At Palmar El Salto, 100% of the seeds were predated by Rattus rattus, precluding further analysis. Finally, 70% of the seedlings were consumed by exotic herbivores (mainly rabbits), resulting in a success rate of 1.81%. Only 7.9% of the surviving seedlings become infantile plants (4 year-old). Our assessment suggests that J. chilensis has aging populations with very few young individuals in disturbed sites to replace the old ones. For those reasons, we suggest increasing its conservation category to critically endangered as land-use change is rapidly fragmenting and shrinking the extant J. chilensis populations. We urge to take urgent actions to protect this relict palm, which otherwise may go extinct in the next decades.

AB  - Eastern Box Turtles (Terrapene carolina) are diet generalists and as such are predicted to have diverse diets in which familiar, low-quality foods are eaten consistently at low levels, and high-quality foods are rare but eaten whenever available. Previous work showed that they feed opportunistically on seasonally available plants (shoots, leaves, flowers, and fruit), invertebrates, mushrooms, and occasionally carrion. We used fecal samples to test optimal foraging predictions relevant to diet generalists and also whether the Eastern Box Turtle diets varied seasonally in a northeastern U.S. pine-oak habitat. We found that in-depth prey species consumption patterns of six different individuals were similar to those of the sampled population overall. Leaf and stem material was consumed by 100% of the turtles in all months despite being lower-quality than other prey available. Invertebrates were consumed by at least 80% of turtles in every study period; Coleopterans were found more commonly than other invertebrates. Snails were not eaten by more than 20% of the turtles in any study period, and mushroom consumption varied from 31-75% of samples in different study periods. Monthly diet overlap was measured using both Pianka's Index of Overlap (PIO) and the Morisita-Horn Index (MH). The PIO method indicated that the prey consumption patterns were broadly similar from June-October, while the M-H method showed that only the July vs. August comparison was highly similar. The turtle diets changed only slightly between seasons, and they conform to predictions of diet generalist models usually applied to mammals.

AB  - The Iberian Peninsula is a primary entry point for non-native species (NNS) into Europe via maritime routes, and is a significant tourist destination. This positions the highly diverse Spanish National Parks at high risk from invasive species, necessitating proactive adaptation and mitigation strategies. We present a comprehensive analysis of the risks posed by NNS to the network of 15 continental and marine National Parks in Spain under climate change, aiming to align management strategies with international Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) targets. We identified 200 NNS across the network of National Parks, including 78 listed in national NNS regulations. Park managers helped identify 22 priority NNS, including the water hyacinth, American mink, Cape fig and wakame, among others. Over half of the 22 priority NNS (55%) were classified as having a "Major" impact on native biodiversity according to EICAT standards, with another 23% considered "Massive". Distribution models suggest that rising minimum temperatures could enable NNS to expand in altitude within the parks, particularly in high-mountain parks. Species like the barbary sheep, water hyacinth and largemouth bass may particularly benefit from global warming. Our findings prioritize national parks most vulnerable to the double threat posed by climate change and invasive species, such as Islas Atl & aacute;nticas, Do & ntilde;ana and Archipelago de Cabrera. We conclude that, in order to progress towards achieving GBF goals, it is essential to: (i) coordinate NNS management efforts across administrations (national and regional), (ii) integrate resources and expertise in a unified strategy against invasion across the network and (iii) enhance public awareness about the risks of introduction and impact of NNS.
   La Pen & iacute;nsula Ib & eacute;rica es el principal punto de entrada de especies ex & oacute;ticas invasoras en Europa a trav & eacute;s de las rutas mar & iacute;timas, adem & aacute;s de un importante destino tur & iacute;stico. Esto sit & uacute;a a los Parques Nacionales espa & ntilde;oles, de extraordinaria diversidad, en una situaci & oacute;n de alto riesgo frente a las invasiones biol & oacute;gicas, lo que requiere estrategias proactivas de adaptaci & oacute;n y mitigaci & oacute;n. En este estudio presentamos un an & aacute;lisis exhaustivo de los riesgos que suponen las especies invasoras para la red de 15 Parques Nacionales de Espa & ntilde;a, con el objetivo de alinear las estrategias de gesti & oacute;n con los objetivos internacionales del Marco Global de Biodiversidad (GBF). Identificamos m & aacute;s de 200 especies ex & oacute;ticas presentes en la red de Parques Nacionales. Si bien no todas han de ser da & ntilde;inas, al menos 68 est & aacute; incluidas en el Cat & aacute;logo Nacional de Especies Ex & oacute;ticas Invasoras. El personal t & eacute;cnico de los parques nos ayud & oacute; a identificar 22 especies ex & oacute;ticas invasoras de preocupaci & oacute;n para la Red de Parques, como el jacinto de agua, el vis & oacute;n americano, la u & ntilde;a de gato y el wakame, entre otras. El 55% de las especies de preocupaci & oacute;n se clasific & oacute; como de impacto "Mayor" sobre la biodiversidad aut & oacute;ctona seg & uacute;n los criterios de la EICAT, y otro 23% se consider & oacute; "Masivo". Los modelos de distribuci & oacute;n sugieren que el aumento de las temperaturas m & iacute;nimas podr & iacute;a permitir a las especies ex & oacute;ticas invasoras expandirse en latitud y altitud dentro de los parques, especialmente en las zonas de alta monta & ntilde;a. Especies como el arru & iacute;, el jacinto de agua y la carpa americana podr & iacute;an beneficiarse especialmente del calentamiento global. Nuestros resultados ayudan a priorizar las especies ex & oacute;ticas y los parques nacionales de mayor riesgo, como Islas Atl & aacute;nticas, Do & ntilde;ana y el Archipi & eacute;lago de Cabrera. Concluimos que para avanzar hacia la consecuci & oacute;n de los objetivos del GBF, es esencial: i) mejorar la coordinaci & oacute;n entre las administraciones competentes en la gesti & oacute;n de especies invasoras (nacionales y regionales), ii) integrar recursos y la experiencia ganada en los distintos parques hacia una estrategia de lucha contra las especies invasoras de aplicaci & oacute;n en toda la red y iii) trabajar en la divulgaci & oacute;n y concienciaci & oacute;n p & uacute;blica respecto a los riesgos de introducci & oacute;n y el impacto sobre la biodiversidad de las especies invasoras.

AB  - Aim It is predicted that insular plant taxa have evolved reduced defences in response to lower herbivore pressure on islands. However, the few studies testing this hypothesis have addressed variation in individual defensive traits, without paying attention to patterns of correlated trait expression (i.e. defence syndromes). Location Balearic and Canary Islands. Taxon Ninety-one woody plant species. Methods We tested whether plant species with contrasting histories of insularity (namely, endemics, non-endemic natives and exotics) differed in their defensive syndromes using a suite of morphological, physical, and chemical traits putatively associated with herbivory. For this, we measured eight leaf traits of 42 endemic, 29 native non-endemic and 20 introduced species for which specimens were sourced from botanical gardens found in two archipelagos: the Balearic and Canary Islands. Results We conducted phylogenetic-controlled analyses which showed that, contrary to predictions, insular taxa (endemics and non-endemic natives) across both archipelagos were more defended (thicker, smaller leaves with less nutrients) than exotic species. There were no differences in chemical defence (phenolic compounds) between endemics, non-endemic natives and exotics. Finally, we also found different defence syndromes between archipelagos: whereas species from the Balearic Islands were more physically defended, on average, those from the Canary Islands had higher chemical defences. Main conclusions Overall, these results point to a defence syndrome based on low-nutrient and physically defended leaves characteristic of insular plant taxa that is indistinct for endemic and non-endemic taxa, relative to introduced species, as well as quantitative and qualitative differences in defences between archipelagos owing to changes in species composition and likely also to different histories of biotic or abiotic pressure.

AB  - Since 2012, control of invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) in the United States (US) has become a state and national priority due to their propensity to damage agricultural commodities and infrastructure, transmit disease, detrimentally affect ecological processes, and compete with native wildlife for resources. While several lifehistory characteristics certainly aided their proliferation, the recreational value of wild pigs was likely the stimulus for translocation and subsequent establishment of populations in >= 35 states, causing an annual economic burden of $1.5 billion in the US. Consequently, state-level legislative procedures regarding wild pigs are expanding in scope and priority, but policy among states lacks uniformity. States vary in their treatment of wild pig control based on differing resource appropriations and stakeholder interests. We conducted an evaluation to determine if policy was associated with state-level 1) presence of wild pigs, 2) spatial extent of wild pig population occupancy, and 3) trajectory of wild pig population occupancy. Our results suggest the presence of wild pigs in various states was influenced by hunting preserves and the sale of hunting opportunities. In occupied states, the spatial extent of wild pigs was again associated with the sale of hunting opportunities and a wild pig hunting culture. Finally, the trajectory of state-level wild pig spatial occupancy was positively influenced by the sale of hunting opportunities, and negatively influenced by transportation policies. Based on these findings, we propose state governments standardize transportation policy and fenced hunting regulations across regions of the US in a more prohibitive fashion to diminish range expansion through illegal and negligent introductions via transportation, release, and escapes from game farms. Moreover, in states where wild pigs have yet to establish, we strongly recommend states proactively prohibit transportation through intra- and interstate movement.

AB  - Rewilding and species reintroductions are increasingly important conservation strategies, involving both captive-bred and wild-rescued animals, with the goal of restoring ecosystems and supporting populations of threatened species. Over the past 30 years, the Elephant Transit Home in Sri Lanka has rescued and rehabilitated more than 150 orphaned elephant calves that were subsequently released back into the wild. Understanding how rehabilitation and release processes affect the welfare status of these calves can provide valuable information on factors affecting release outcomes. This study evaluated patterns of faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations as a physiological indicator of stress in 10 orphaned elephants (six males, four females) rescued at <= 1 year of age and released back into Udawalawe National Park after rehabilitation at the Elephant Transit Home (release age, 6 to 8 years). Faecal samples (similar to 2/week) were collected for 9 months pre- (n = 53 samples) and 16 months post- (n = 153 samples) release. Mean fGCM concentrations during the early post-release period (first 17 days) were significantly higher than in pre- and later post-release periods, with no differences between males and females. Results indicate elephants adapted quickly after release, likely aided by being released in a small group (n = 10) of socialized cohorts. In fact, fGCM normalized to concentrations lower on average than at the Elephant Transit Home in the months preceding release. Understanding the stress response of elephants during and after translocations is crucial for well-being and successful integration into the wild. Minimizing stress through appropriate protocols, such as selecting strong social units, is essential. Hormonal monitoring is a valuable tool that should be considered long-term to assess the adaptation, survival and eventual reproductive success of rewilded elephants.

AB  - The foraging behavior of ruminating ungulates significantly impacts forest ecosystems due to their nutritional requirements. This study focuses on inter-specific comparisons of bark browsing (stripping) between Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and silver fir (Abies alba Mill.). Field measurements were conducted at the previously established research demonstration site "Husarik" in the Javorniky Mountains, north-western Slovakia. We measured the sizes of wounds on stems and assessed the dimensions of unrecovered parts of wounds, subsequently calculating areas of recovered bark patches. Then, the total areas of wounds recovered patches, and unrecovered parts were measured. Additionally, the percentages of wound areas, recovered areas, and unrecovered areas were expressed as proportions relative to the total bark surface. Influencing factors such as the position of wounds along the vertical stem profile and stem diameter class were analyzed using two- and three-way ANOVA followed by Fisher's LSD test. The results demonstrate the susceptibility of both tree species to bark browsing by ruminating ungulates, primarily red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) in our study site. Douglas fir exhibited slightly less intense browsing compared to silver fir, while silver fir had a slightly higher recovery rate. Specifically, 17.0% of the bark surface in Douglas fir and 21.5% in silver fir were browsed. The proportions of recovered areas on wounds were 62.5% and 69.6% in Douglas fir and silver fir, respectively. Regarding the vertical stem profile, the most intense browsing occurred at a height of 101-125 cm from the ground level, with rates of 40.7% in Douglas fir and 47.0% in silver fir. Browsing intensity showed negligible variation among diameter classes, which were classified as up to 35 mm, 35-50 mm, and over 50 mm. Our findings suggest that, as an introduced species, Douglas fir is not a suitable substitute for other commercially significant tree species in supporting sustainable forestry in European countries where ruminating ungulates are overabundant.

AB  - Invasive species are the second largest contributor to biodiversity loss and drivers of ecosystem change. Buffelgrass is a C4, perennial grass native to Africa and Asia that was widely introduced across tropical and subtropical rangelands as livestock forage. Buffelgrass reduces native biodiversity and ecosystem stability in its introduced range when it escapes livestock pastures. Understanding the ecology of insects associated with buffelgrass in its native range may provide an understanding of invasion processes and biological control opportunities where buffelgrass has become an invasive challenge. Here, we present the results of a six-year survey of herbivorous arthropods of a native buffelgrass population from Kenya. Buffelgrass was examined for externally and internally feeding insects of vegetative and reproductive tissues. We also categorised buffelgrass detritivores and parasitoids that may use buffelgrass herbivores as hosts. The samples were photographed and Sanger sequenced to identify them to the lowest possible taxonomic ranking. We collected information on sample abundances, phenologies, tissues consumed, and putative diet breadths. We identified 25 morphospecies representing seven orders and 16 families. The putative host plant specialisation was as high as 67% for Diptera. Phenological variation in herbivore presence correlated with seasonal rainfall and provided a guide for when to conduct follow-up biological control agent searches. The most abundant herbivore was a gall midge (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) that inhabits buffelgrass culms. Additional research should focus on bringing this species into containment where host choice trials can be conducted to determine if it is truly monophagous and assess its impact on buffelgrass growth.

AB  - To ensure successful introductions and translocations of giraffes, more scientific information is needed on their diet selections, especially concerning the availability of browsing material. To our knowledge, this 15-month study is one of the first to assess giraffe diet selection by fitting global positioning system collars on this species to monitor the spatial distribution and identify the most utilised vegetation and areas. The study population resided in the Khamab Kalahari Nature Reserve in the northwestern Kalahari region of South Africa. The results indicated the clear utilisation of specific plant species of specific areas during different seasons and between different vegetation types and species. This study provides innovative information to understand better how this giraffe population from the northwestern Kalahari region has adapted its diet selections, especially when compared to other giraffe populations from different regions.
   Diet selection concerning browse availability of giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) was studied over 15 months in an arid environment in South Africa. A global positioning system collar was fitted to a giraffe individual to assess the specific areas, consisting of different vegetation types, that the population utilised during different seasons. Results are provided on diet selection in relation to browse availability between seasons and vegetation types, including tree densities and the amount of the total evapotranspiration tree equivalents. Diet selections of the giraffe population changed in response to the availability of browse material from July to October. The availability of important resource areas had a significant (p < 0.05) effect on the spatial ecology, and an increase in home range size was noted. Information that is important for the well-being of giraffes was identified. This included nutritional stress and the limited variety of the most utilised tree species available for browsing, especially during critical dry periods. The results demonstrate the importance of assessment of giraffes' diet selection in relation to browse availability, especially before introduction to a new area, to limit the lack of population growth and underperformance. This study provides valuable information towards understanding the resources and habitats required for successful giraffe management.

AB  - IntroductionAmerican black bears (Ursus americanus) have been documented to have top-down effects, both consumptive (through predation) and nonconsumptive (through fear effects). However, their behavioural and dietary adaptability has led to uncertainty about the conditions under which these may occur.ObjectivesWe aimed to (1) investigate when, where, and how often black bears influence lower trophic levels, and (2) critically assess the experimental design of such studies to determine trends and biases.MethodsWe conducted a systematic literature search and used linear mixed-effects models to assess the relationships among prey age class, the presence of other large carnivores, and the percentage of ungulate mortality due to black bears. We also summarised the measured effects of black bears on other carnivores and the results of any experimental studies.ResultsWe found a strong negative relationship between puma presence and the percentage of ungulate mortality due to black bears, but only in areas with at least one other large carnivore (e.g., wolves). Among 16 studies of black bears' impacts on other carnivores, most documented negative behavioural effects. While only 5% of studies had strong experimental design, bear removal consistently increased juvenile ungulate survival.Discussion and SynthesisOur findings highlight black bears' strong top-down effects, resembling or exceeding those of other large carnivores. These effects were greatest when no other large carnivores were present, but as highly effective kleptoparasites, black bears can alter the feeding habits of other large carnivores. Thus, we argue that 'apex' is a conditional state, not a species-wide status.

AB  - Understanding the exchange of individuals between wildlife populations, particularly those with naturally fragmented habitats, is important for the effective management of these species. This is of particular consequence when the species is of conservation concern, and isolated populations may be lost due to pressures from predation or competition, or catastrophic events such as wildfire. Here we demonstrate the use kinship and population structure analysis to show potential recent movement between colonies in metapopulations of yellow-footed rock-wallaby (Petrogale xanthopus Gray 1854) at two sites in the Grey Range of Queensland, and at four sites in the Gawler Ranges of South Australia. These colonies are also compared to a single colony from the Flinders Ranges, a connected landscape of rock-wallaby habitat. Using reduced representation next-generation sequencing, we acquired and filtered a set of similar to 17,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms to examine population genetic variation, structure and relationships within populations, and also identify putative migrants. Initial STRUCTURE analysis re-confirmed each population should be considered separately. Tests of population genetic variation identify several colonies appearing to be experiencing genetic erosion, also with low calculated effective population sizes (N-e = 4.5-36.6). Pairwise comparisons of individual relatedness (relatedness coeffiecients; r) implied several contemporary movement events between colonies within both the Gawler and Grey Ranges (r > 0.125), which was then affirmed with tests for putative first generation migrants. These results are of particular note in South Australia, where threat abatement (management of key predators and competitors) may facilitate dispersion. Additionally, in Queensland, colonies are separated by anthropogenic barriers: predator exclusion fencing designed to exclude dingoes (Canis familiaris) from grazing land, which may hinder dispersal. This work highlights the usefulness of population genetics to inform management outcomes in wildlife, in this case, highlighting the need for threatened species management at the landscape level.

AB  - Context. Free-roaming dogs are ubiquitous worldwide and pose a threat to wildlife. An understanding of the roaming behaviour of dogs is useful for developing effective management strategies. Aims. We aimed to assess the activity ranges and patterns of free-roaming dogs in a rural Cambodian village. An adjacent wildlife sanctuary protects populations of threatened species that may be negatively impacted by dogs. Methods. We used rudimentary hand-made GPS collars to track village dogs and quantify their movements. Activity ranges were calculated for male and female dogs, and the mean distances travelled at night and during the day were determined. Additionally, forays outside of the activity range were characterised. Key results. We estimated a mean activity range of 178 +/- 190 ha and found that dogs typically travelled longer distances at night. Females had significantly smaller activity ranges, as well as covering shorter distances per day. Foray behaviour was variable, with some dogs entering the wildlife sanctuary regularly and others not at all. Conclusions. Free-roaming Cambodian dog activity overlapped with native mammals in the study site, posing a risk of predation, resource exclusion, harassment and competition of Cambodian species. Implications. The data suggest that although dogs generally spend the majority of their time within the village, there is significant risk to wildlife. Actions are required to mitigate threats to native wildlife, in particular threatened species such as Eld's Deer.

AB  - Many savanna-dependent species in Africa including large herbivores and apex predators are at increasing risk of extinction. Achieving effective management of protected areas (PAs) in Africa where lions live will cost an estimated US$ >1-2 billion/year in new funding. We explore the potential for fire-management-based carbon financing programs to fill this funding gap and benefit degrading savanna ecosystems. We demonstrate how introducing early dry season fire management programs could produce potential carbon revenues (PCRs) from either a single carbon financing method (avoided emissions) or from multiple sequestration methods ranging from US$ 59.6-655.9 million/year (at US$ 5/ton) or US$ 155.0 million/year to US$ 1.7 billion/year (at US$ 13/ton). We highlight variable but significant PCRs for savanna PAs from US$ 1.5-44.4 million/year per PA. We suggest investing in fire management programs to jump-start the United Nations Decade of Ecological Restoration to help restore degraded African savannas and conserve imperiled keystone herbivores and apex predators.

AB  - The endangered Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) population is declining, and its conservation is threatened by the species' low fecundity and high pup mortality. This study details reasons for pup deaths and quantifies the impacts of disease and comorbidity. Of 284 dead pups reported from five breeding seasons (2016-2022) at the Seal Bay colony, Kangaroo Island, gross necropsy was conducted on 122, with fecal analysis for hookworm (Uncinaria sanguinis) detection, tissue histology, and bacterial culture performed on subsets. Determinable primary causes of mortality were conspecific trauma (+/- comorbidity, 41.0%), starvation (24.6%), and infectious disease (hookworm-associated hemorrhagic enteritis [HAHE] +/- bacterial infection, 19.7%). Allowing for comorbidity, 37.7% of pups died with an infectious disease, including 44.0% of deaths with trauma and 41.5% with starvation. In higher mortality summer-autumn breeding seasons, pups were at greater risk of trauma (p = .001) and subsequent bacterial infection (p < .001). Parasiticide treatment significantly reduced HAHE-associated (p = .005) and overall mortality (p < .001) risk, suggesting hookworm infection increases pup susceptibility to other causes of mortality. Although the exact causal pathways for this treatment-related overall mortality benefit remain to be confirmed, intervention appears highly impactful and could benefit species conservation efforts.

AB  - Insect-plant interactions are among importantly ecological processes, and rapid environmental changes such as temperature and resource fluctuations can disrupt long-standing insect-plant interactions. While individual impacts of climate warming, atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition, and plant provenance on insect-plant interactions are well studied, their joint effects on insect-plant interactions are less explored in ecologically realistic settings. To this end, we performed five experiments with native and invasive Solidago canadensis populations from home and introduced ranges and two insect herbivores (leaf-chewing Spodoptera litura and sap-sucking Corythucha marmorata) in the context of climate warming and N deposition. We determined leaf defensive traits, feeding preference, and insect growth and development, and quantified the possible associations among climate change, host-plant traits, and insect performance with structural equation modeling. First, native S. canadensis populations experienced higher damage by S. litura but lower damage by C. marmorata than invasive S. canadensis populations in the ambient environment. Second, warming decreased the leaf consumption, growth, and survival of S. litura on native S. canadensis populations, but did not affect these traits on invasive S. canadensis populations; warming increased the number of C. marmorata on native S. canadensis populations via direct facilitation, but decreased that on invasive S. canadensis populations via indirect suppression. Third, N addition enhanced the survival of S. litura on native S. canadensis populations, and its feeding preference and leaf consumption on invasive S. canadensis populations. Finally, warming plus N addition exhibited non-additive effects on insect-plant interactions. Based on these results, we tentatively conclude that climate warming could have contrasting effects on insect-plant interactions depending on host-plant provenance and that the effects of atmospheric N deposition on insects might be relatively weak compared to climate warming. Future studies should focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying these different patterns.

AB  - Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) are apex predators that spend several months at sea feeding over vast areas. Their population trends are related to food availability during winter, which in turn is influenced by environmental conditions; thus, fluctuations in their populations reflect changes in the ecosystems. Although population trends for this species are available for large populations, there are still small colonies for which information is scarce, as is the case for the colony located at Peninsula Potter, South Shetland Islands. At this colony, field censuses of the number of breeding females conducted from 1995 to 2018 revealed an overall decline of 11.9% at an annual rate of 0.6%. However, contrasting trends before and after 2008 were observed. A decrease of 46.5% at an annual rate of 4.6% was registered before 2008, while for the subsequent period (2008-2018) the number of females increased by 64.5% at an annual rate of 5%. A positive association was observed between the extent of sea ice in winter foraging areas and population numbers between 1995 and 2008. The females of this colony feed on the edge of the sea ice, so in years of low sea ice extension the effort required to reach these areas is greater. This could lead individuals to choose to breed in areas closer to their feeding grounds in order to avoid the energetic expenditure of body reserves acquired during winter that would sustain the return trip to their natal colony.

AB  - Rewilding aims to restore 'self-willed' ecosystems involving the creation of habitat subject to stochastic disturbance, connected by favorable corridors for dispersal of animals including insects. Herbivores such as the Eurasian beaver Castor fiber (Linnaeus, 1758) have been reintroduced in the UK to promote natural flood management as part of a rewilding strategy. At Spains Hall in Finchingfield (south-east England), beavers were released into two large enclosures (both c. 20 ha) in March 2023 which were concurrently reverting from arable farmland to riparian meadow. Monitoring of Orthoptera 15-18 months after release in June-September 2024 revealed statisti-cal evidence that the abundance of the two localised groundhoppers, Tetrix subulata (Linnaeus, 1758) and Tetrix undulata (Sowerby, 1806), and the lesser marsh grasshopper Chorthippus albomarginatus (De Geer, 1773), was higher in the beaver enclosure meadows than in the control plots. The Essex Red Data List species, the common green grasshopper Omocestus viridulus (Linnaeus, 1758), was also recorded within the beaver meadows. The damming of the watercourse in one enclosure led to the creation of new off-line lotic channels and wet ground which were important for these species, particularly bare mud margins which were used by groundhoppers (Tetrigidae). There was also evidence that meadows on the east side of the river had a greater abundance of long-winged conehead Conocephalus fuscus (Fabricius, 1793) and T. subulata than the west, perhaps due to the sheltered microclimate and wetland features on this side of the channel, particularly in the beaver enclosures. We conclude that in enclosures on former arable farmland Orthoptera may respond to damming which quickly creates beaver meadows in flooded areas within the first two years of release. However, only one enclosure had dams in this study so the effects of beavers may be dependent on variables such as habitat quality and watercourse characteristics.

AB  - Pleistocene vertebrate faunas have long been known from the island of Timor but have rarely been studied. In particular, dwarf elephant-like proboscideans such as Stegodon were once widespread across the island, including to the Atambua Basin, but the cause of their extinction is unknown. Here, we document the fossil Pleistocene fauna of this basin with their palaeoenvironmental context. We also investigate the possibility of human-Stegodon chronological overlap. Our methods include field survey, excavation, pollen analysis, and U-series dating. Palaeoenvironmental data based on geomorphology and hydrological information show a transition from marine to fluvial depositional conditions in the basin during Pleistocene. Pollen data supports this interpretation and shows a clear shift from mangrove to terrestrial vegetation types. Palaeoclimatic conditions after the transition are characterized by a high humidity with high-flow water across the basin. Fossils of vertebrate faunas are restricted to fluvially-derived sandstone units. Meanwhile lithic artefacts were recorded widely across the basin, in the from of surface finds. There is so far no example of direct association of lithic artefacts with extinct Pleistocene faunas. Direct dating of the vertebrate fossils suggest they came from the Middle Pleistocene or earlier, and consequently pre-date the oldest current records of modern human existence on the island similar to 45,000 years ago.

AB  - Melocactus Link & Otto is one of the most representative and endangered genera of Cactaceae in Sergipe. This study evaluates ex situ conservation under two integrative approaches: the rescue of adult plants to set a germplasm bank and the analysis of different substrates to establish a seedling bank of rescued species. We collected thirty individuals of each species and cultivated thorn in a greenhouse for twelve months. We evaluated the number of flowers, fruits, and seeds daily, as well as the mortality rate of adult plants. We evaluated five substrates to establish the seedling bank 1 - sand, 2 - sand + commercial soil (1:1), 3 - sand + goat manure (1:1), 4 - soil (100% volume) and 5 - soil + goat manure (1:1). We found mortality rates of 0%, 10% and 50% for M. zehntneri, M. violaceus subsp. margaritaceus and M. sergipensis, respectively. We found two phenological patterns for the species in the germplasm bank: a continuous production of flowers, fruits and seeds throughout the year and another pattern, with periods of greater production of flowers, fruits, and seeds. We also found positive correlations between the environmental factors and the phenological stages of the species. We conclude that substrates 'sand' and 'sand + soil' are the most suitable to produce seedlings of the three species of Melocactus.

AB  - Microplastics are recognized as a newly emerging threat to marine organisms as they can be ingested and accumulated through multiple trophic levels. However, microplastic contamination and its potential risk assessment in coral reef fishes have been less addressed, particularly in remote ocean regions. In this study, microplastics in 167 samples of coral reef fish (a total of eighteen species) from the Xisha areas of the South China Sea were studied. There were fifteen species of coral reef fish contaminated by microplastics with an average occurrence rate of 29.3 %. The shape of microplastics in the fishes was mostly fibrous with small sizes (400-900 & mu;m) and light colors (transparent and blue). The dominant types of microplastic polymers are polyamide and polyethylene terephthalate, accounting for 77 % and 11 % of microplastics in the fish body. There were generally more microplastics in the herbivorous fishes than the carnivorous ones. The highest microplastic abundance and occurrence was found in parrotfish due to its direct feeding on the microplastics-contaminated corals. In addition, there were much more microplastics in the gastrointestinal tracts than in the gills of the Xisha fishes. Microplastic abundance was found negatively correlated with the trophic level of the Xisha fishes supporting a stronger microplastic impact at lower levels of marine animals. Finally, a risk assessment using the polymer hazard index (PHI) revealed that microplastic contamination in the Xisha fishes was lower than those in the eutrophic coast. Our study provides new evidence for the widespread presence of microplastic contamination in the fishes of the remote Xisha coral reefs.

AB  - Organochlorine contaminants (OCs) accumulate in top predators, reaching high levels associated with negative physiological effects. Measuring OCs is key for assessing the accumulation of their loads and evaluating the efficiency of contaminant regulations. Some OCs generate specific signatures in certain areas, which allow us to track potential movements and feeding habits of species. Thirty-five blubber biopsies were taken from northern elephant seals (NES) during fall at Guadalupe Island (GI), Mexico, an important site for hauling-out, molting, and breeding. Biopsies were analyzed for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites (tDDTs), hexachlorobenzene, chlordanes, and total PCB congeners (tPCBs). tDDTs were higher in adults than in juveniles, suggesting age class-based bioaccumulation, related to time and differences in foraging and habitat use between age groups. Females had higher variability of OCs than males, attributed to multiple causes, including variation in the use of foraging grounds and niche segregation. The DDT:PCB ratios were the highest, showing similarity with the Palos Verdes (California) contaminant signature, suggesting the use of similar feeding areas in relation to juvenile NES from Southern California.Our baseline of OC levels for NES at GI, allows future monitoring of changes in legacy contaminants over time, and the evaluation of the efficiency of their regulations.

AB  - The European earwig F. auricularia L. is an omnivore that has only recently been identified as a direct, fruit-feeding pest of citrus. Here, we start to build the basic tools needed for integrated pest management for this species. We introduce a time-efficient sampling method based on small wooden boards placed on the ground, and we use them in a 2-yr survey of 93 commercial citrus blocks in California's San Joaquin Valley. Insecticides were not applied targeting F. auricularia in any of these citrus blocks. We find that F. auricularia populations are very low or undetectable in most blocks, with higher densities occurring only sporadically. To know when control measures should be implemented, we used video-monitoring of citrus tree trunks to characterize the timing of F. auricularia movement from their soil nests into the tree canopy. Movement of earwigs along the tree trunks was observed throughout our sampling period (22 March to 18 June), suggesting that control measures (sticky bands placed on trunks, or insecticides applied to trunks and surrounding soil surface) should be applied early, well before petal fall when fruit are susceptible to F. auricularia herbivory. Sticky barriers effectively reduced the vertical movement of 2 crawling arthropods, F. auricularia and the Fuller rose beetle Napactus godmanni, along citrus trunks. We failed to find any relationship between estimated F. auricularia densities and damage to maturing or harvested fruit. This highlights a set of important and still unresolved questions about the biology of this species, underscoring the need for additional research.

AB  - This study investigated the association between sediment contamination, PCB accumulation in adult nesting males and the occurrence of embryonic abnormalities in the damselfish, Abudefduf sordidus, from two sites with high PCB contamination and three "reference" sites (contaminants very low or not measurable) within Johnston Atoll, Central Pacific Ocean. Developmental abnormalities were assessed in damselfish embryos collected in the field during four natural spawning seasons (1996, 1998, 1999, and 2001). Laboratory incubations of abnormal embryos demonstrated that the observed abnormalities were lethal. PCBs were measured in fish collected in three years. Mean whole-body concentrations of total PCBs ranged from 364.6 to 138,032.5 ng/g lipid. A significant residue-effect relationship was found between total PCB concentration and embryo abnormalities. The occurrence of embryo abnormalities was positively related to fish PCB concentration (other contaminants were also evaluated including metals and dioxins). This study demonstrates the utility of using damselfish embryos as a bioindicator tool for monitoring coral reefs. It also provides baseline-monitoring criteria and evaluates sediment quality benchmarks used for ecological risk assessments on coral reefs.

AB  - Simple Summary In the local populations, the increase in inbreeding is a relevant problem for the reduction in production, reproduction, and adaptive traits. The application of genomic technologies has facilitated the assessment of inbreeding in these populations. The current study aims to investigate the patterns of homozygosity in five Italian local goat populations. The results showed the different selection histories and breeding schemes of these goat populations. The analysis also indicated the importance of this information to avoid future loss of diversity and to produce information for designing optimal breeding and conservation programs. The application of genomic technologies has facilitated the assessment of genomic inbreeding based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this study, we computed several runs of homozygosity (ROH) parameters to investigate the patterns of homozygosity using Illumina Goat SNP50 in five Italian local populations: Argentata dell'Etna (N = 48), Derivata di Siria (N = 32), Girgentana (N = 59), Maltese (N = 16) and Messinese (N = 22). The ROH results showed well-defined differences among the populations. A total of 3687 ROH segments >2 Mb were detected in the whole sample. The Argentata dell'Etna and Messinese were the populations with the lowest mean number of ROH and inbreeding coefficient values, which reflect admixture and gene flow. In the Girgentana, we identified an ROH pattern related with recent inbreeding that can endanger the viability of the breed due to reduced population size. The genomes of Derivata di Siria and Maltese breeds showed the presence of long ROH (>16 Mb) that could seriously impact the overall biological fitness of these breeds. Moreover, the results confirmed that ROH parameters are in agreement with the known demography of these populations and highlighted the different selection histories and breeding schemes of these goat populations. In the analysis of ROH islands, we detected harbored genes involved with important traits, such as for milk yield, reproduction, and immune response, and are consistent with the phenotypic traits of the studied goat populations. Finally, the results of this study can be used for implementing conservation programs for these local populations in order to avoid further loss of genetic diversity and to preserve the production and fitness traits. In view of this, the availability of genomic data is a fundamental resource.

AB  - foraging groups of reef fishes, although relatively common in occurrence, have historically received little attention. Most studies on this topic have been descriptive accounts of specific associations. In this study, we collected data on mixed-species foraging groups seen in the Lakshadweep islands, resulting in a dataset of 1289 groups. Data was collected from both reefs and lagoons of three islands (Kadmat, Kavaratti, and Agatti) within the Lakshadweep Archipelago over a period of three years. Cluster analysis revealed nine categories based on species composition in groups: parrotfish, juveniles, surgeonfish (small), surgeonfish (large), Anampses spp., wrasses, Parupeneus macronema, Parupeneus barberinus, and other goatfish groups. The clusters are named based on the nuclear species or most frequently seen species within the groups. These groups are distinct not only in terms of composition but also other parameters such as behavior (shoaling or attendant groups), habitat affinity, and group cohesion. Groups comprising herbivorous species such as parrotfish and surgeonfish were almost entirely shoaling in nature (large groups without nuclear individuals), whereas goatfish and wrasses tended to form smaller attendant associations. Groups also occupied different habitat typest for example, parrotfish and P. barberinus groups were seen mostly in lagoons while surgeonfish, wrasses, and P. macronema groups were more abundant on reefs. Our findings suggest that mixed-species foraging groups in fishes are comprised of distinct compositional categories that vary in behavior, cohesion, and habitat affinity.

AB  - Long-term movements of adult marine animals predicate spatial management measures. Sea cucumbers are intensely exploited worldwide, yet few studies have assessed their long-term movement potential. Elephant trunkfish, Holothuria (Microthele) fuscopunctata, is a large coral reef holothuroid. At four sites at Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef, we photographically marked and georeferenced 36 H. fuscopunctata, ranging 1.4-5.1 kg in weight. In broader searches one year later, we recaptured 92% of the animals. Their displacements were comparable among sites and averaged 8.7 m yr(-1). None of the movements could be characterised as nomadic; the maximum displacement was 21 m. Contrary to expectations, smaller animals tended to roam further than larger animals (p = 0.025). Our study shows that certain large-bodied sea cucumbers might not displace far over annual timescales. This empirical evidence of home ranging reshapes our understanding of echinoderm mobility and reveals a behaviour that would exacerbate Allee effects at low population densities.

AB  - Plants growing outside their native range may be confronted by new regimes of herbivory, but how this affects plant chemical defence profiles has rarely been studied. Using Plantago lanceolata as a model species, we investigated whether introduced populations show significant differences from native populations in several growth and chemical defence traits. Plantago lanceolata (ribwort plantain) is an herbaceous plant species native to Europe and Western Asia that has been introduced to numerous countries worldwide. We sampled seeds from nine native and 10 introduced populations that covered a broad geographic and environmental range and performed a greenhouse experiment, in which we infested half of the plants in each population with caterpillars of the generalist herbivore Spodoptera littoralis. We then measured size-related and resource-allocation traits as well as the levels of constitutive and induced chemical defence compounds in roots and shoots of P. lanceolata. When we considered the environmental characteristics of the site of origin, our results revealed that populations from introduced ranges were characterized by an increase in chemical defence compounds without compromising plant biomass. The concentrations of iridoid glycosides and verbascoside, the major anti-herbivore defence compounds of P. lanceolata, were higher in introduced populations than in native populations. In addition, introduced populations exhibited greater rates of herbivore-induced volatile organic compound emission and diversity, and similar chemical diversity based on untargeted analyses of leaf methanol extracts. In conclusion, the geographic origin of the populations had a significant influence on morphological and chemical plant traits, suggesting that P. lanceolata populations are not only adapted to different environments in their native range, but also in their introduced range.

AB  - Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) released into the environment have an adverse impact on the soil and water ecosystem as well as human health. Sorption of PhACs by soils and its potential modification through introduced DOM in the applied animal manure or treated wastewater (TWW) determines the mobility and environmental relevance of PhACs. Sulfadiazine, caffeine and atenolol were selected as target PhACs to investigate their sorption behaviors by five selected arable soils in the absence and presence of pig manure DOM. Sulfadiazine was least sorbed, followed by caffeine and atenolol according to the Freundlich sorption isotherm fit (soil average K-f [mu g((1-n)) mL(n) g(-1)] 4.07, 9.06, 18.92, respectively). The addition of manure DOM (31.34 mg C L-1) decreased the sorption of sulfadiazine and especially of caffeine and atenolol (average K-f 3.04, 6.17, 5.79, respectively). Freundlich sorption isotherms of the PhACs became more nonlinear in the presence of manure DOM (Freundlich exponent n changed from 0.74-1.40 to 0.62-1.12), implying more heterogeneous sorption of PhACs in soil-DOM binary systems. Sorption competition of DOM molecules with sulfadiazine and caffeine mostly contributed to their decreased soil sorption when DOM was present. In contrast, the formation of DOM-atenolol associates in the solution phase caused the largely decreased soil sorption of atenolol in the presence of DOM. It is suggested that DOM concentration (e.g., >= 60 mg C L-1) and its interaction with PhACs should be taken into consideration when assessing the environmental impact of land application of animal manure or irrigation with TWW.

AB  - Soil specialists can have restricted distributions, and effective management in the face of land use change depends on a thorough understanding of the ecology of these unique plants. We investigated the ecology of Eriogonum tiehmii Reveal, a rare soil specialist, using pitfall traps, flower observations, and pollinator exclusion to assess arthropod communities in E. tiehmii habitat, the most common visitors to E. tiehmii flowers, and the importance of pollination for seed set. We collected soil from 21 occupied and unoccupied sites for analysis of physical and chemical characteristics, and conducted a greenhouse soil preference experiment to test how seeds and seedlings respond to soil variation. We also monitored tagged plants in extant populations, measuring survival, size, and reproductive output. Arthropod communities within and around E. tiehmii sites were abundant and diverse; each sample site contained numerous unique species, and there was high turnover in arthropod community composition over time. Open pollination significantly increased seed production, with beetles, wasps, and flies the most likely important pollinators. Reproductive output and size class distributions varied among wild populations, and soil properties differed between occupied and unoccupied sites. Occupied sites were, on average, lower in sulfur, zinc, potassium, and magnesium and, on average higher in boron, pH, and silt, among other differences, though there was high variation in these characteristics among sites. Seedlings demonstrated sensitivity to individual soil properties, and seedlings grown in soils from occupied sites had, on average, higher total biomass and higher root allocation than seedlings grown in soils from unoccupied sites. These preference tests suggest a "specialist" model of soil specialization rather than a "refuge" model, indicating that plants are not simply highly stress-tolerant, but are specifically adapted to their native soil types. While some unoccupied sites we tested were favorable for some life history stages, we did not identify unoccupied sites that could support both establishment and growth of E. tiehmii seedlings. Future work could consider the effects of biotic interactions such as plant competition and herbivores on plant growth, and employ additional demographic monitoring to better understand life history and population dynamics of this extreme soil specialist.

AB  - Reliable population abundance estimates are invaluable to wildlife management programs. Mark-recapture techniques are regarded as the gold standard for estimating abundance but can be financially or logistically prohibitive. Recent developments in remote camera analytical approaches have provided alternative methods to estimate unmarked populations efficiently but have undergone limited field testing. In September and October 2020, I assessed 2 camera methods that use the same set of time-lapse photographs; a space to event (STE) model and instantaneous sampling (IS), applied to a case study of feral sheep (Ovis aries) at the US Army's Pohakuloa Training Area (PTA) on Hawai`i Island. Results of the camera methods were compared to an abundance estimate calculated from an aerial distance sampling survey completed concurrently with camera sampling. A comparison of confidence intervals indicated no statistical difference between estimates, but the relative imprecision of IS suggested the STE model to be a more reliable estimator. The cost of camera sampling was approximately 3 times that of the aerial survey, but camera sampling became more economical if the area was resurveyed 3 or more times. My study showed the STE model to be a cost effective, practical abundance estimator of feral sheep when compared to well-established aerial distance sampling techniques, and therefore should offer considerable potential for the conservation and management of other easily identifiable species.

AB  - Introduced herbivores often alter predator-prey dynamics between native organisms. We investigated whether the exotic mite Raoiella indica can interfere in the predation relationships between the predator Amblyseius largoensis and the native herbivorous mite Oligonychus pratensis and be favored as a result. Populations of A. largoensis were established in laboratory, one reared with exotic prey and another with native prey. For each population, of A. largoensis were evaluated for: egg-to-adult developmental time, oviposition rate, and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) of females. Also, to observe the interaction with prey, behavioral tests were conducted, evaluating the time to the first attack, oviposition site preference, and prey preference consumption. Regardless of prey offered, there was no prey effect on immature developmental time or female oviposition rate. However, A. largoensis showed superior FCE feed on exotic (11.4%) over native prey (3.9%). Both A. largoensis populations preferred to prey on eggs of native species and also tended to choose oviposition sites containing native prey eggs. Those reared on exotic prey attacked their first prey in less time than those reared on native prey. Therefore, the presence of R. indica affects both predator population growth and the feeding preference for native prey, which causes a risk of displacement of O. pratensis.

AB  - Biological monitoring in protected areas is essential for making management decisions, especially in small (<1000 km(2)), fenced reserves which require intensive intervention to maintain core habitat characteristics. Estimates of species richness and community structure provide important information for planning and evaluating conservation strategies. Majete Wildlife Reserve (MWR) is a small (691 km(2)), isolated reserve in southern Malawi in the Miombo Woodland Ecoregion. We investigated species richness and community structure of the terrestrial medium and large mammals at MWR through a standardised camera trap survey. During the 2018 dry season, 140 camera locations were sampled for 40 days each. Thirty-five mammal species were detected and Chao 2, ICE and Jackknife 1 and 2 richness estimators indicated between 36-41 species present which aligns closely with historic accounts. Non-detection of some species is attributed to species specialised habitat requirements not catered for in the systematic camera trap survey design. Mammal community structure, calculated from the camera detected species' relative abundance indices (RAI), was atypical for Miombo woodland, with an underrepresentation of elephants. Camera trap-derived RAI was positively related with 2018 aerial census species encounter data. These results can assist management in refining survey techniques and act as a baseline to monitor conservation efforts.

AB  - This paper introduces Xanthomelon amurndamilumila sp. nov., a newly-discovered land snail species inhabiting the North East Isles, offshore from Groote Eylandt (= Ayangkidarrba), north-western Gulf of Carpentaria, in the Northern Territory, Australia. Specimens of this species were first collected during the 2021 Bush Blitz expedition to Groote Eylandt, a large offshore archipelago previously unexplored for land snails. The taxonomic status of the new species was established through a comprehensive analysis of comparative morphology and mitochondrial genetics: X. amurndamilumila forms a maximally supported clade closely related to X. arnhemense and is characterised by a unique combination of morphological characteristics, including smaller shell size, distinctive sculpture of collabral ridges and specific features of its reproductive anatomy. The genetic divergence and phylogenetic relationships suggest historical isolation. While the discovery of X. amurndamilumila sp. nov. enriches our understanding of land snail diversity in the Northern Territory, its conservation status is of concern on North East Island because of habitat degradation caused by feral deer.

AB  - Cryptorchidism is the failure of one or both testes to descend into the bottom of the scrotum. This common congenital malformation in humans and domestic animals is the best characterized risk factor for abnormal sperm functions and infertility. However, current treatment approaches for cryptorchidism do not ensure paternity in all cases. Some lineages of mammals (such as elephants and cetaceans) have natural ascrotal testes (i.e., undescended or incompletely descended testes) and normal sperm motility and fertility, providing an opportunity to understand the genetic basis of cryptorchidism. In this study, we showed that genes associated with sperm motility and competition/fertility in ascrotal mammals experienced frequent, strong selective pressure. The fixation of specific amino acids and positive selection in ascrotal mammals could affect the physicochemical properties and functions of fertilization-related proteins. In a comparison between mammals with undescended testes and incompletely descended testes, discrepancies in genes showing evidence for adaptive evolution and in functional enrichment suggested that multiple molecular mechanisms contribute to the maintenance of fertility in the challenging testicular environment. Our findings revealed substantial heterogeneity in the divergence of fertilization-related genes between natural scrotal and ascrotal mammals and provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying normal sperm motility and competition in natural ascrotal mammals. We provide a detailed theoretical basis for understanding the pathology of cryptorchidism from a molecular evolutionary perspective. This study may contribute to the establishment of diagnostic and therapeutic targets for sperm motility and fertility disorders due to congenital cryptorchidism in humans and domestic animals.

AB  - Human-elephant conflict is increasing across many parts of Asia and Africa. Mitigating elephant crop raiding has become a major focus of conservation intervention, however, many existing methods for tackling this problem are expensive and difficult to execute. Thus, there is a need for more affordable, farm-based methods. Testing these methods is key to ensuring their effectiveness and feasibility. In this study, we tested a novel olfactory deterrent, the "smelly elephant repellent", a foul-smelling organic liquid, on 40 farms in Uganda and Kenya. Our results show that the repellent was effective at deterring elephants from crop raiding. Over the study period, 82% of 309 elephant crop raids were deterred in Uganda. In Kenya, the repellent deterred 63% of 24 crop raiding incidents, and there was a significant effect of the repellent on test sites compared with control sites. The smelly repellent could be a helpful crop raiding mitigation tool for farmers, as this study showed it to be effective, relatively cheap, quick to produce from locally available ingredients, and communities have a positive attitude towards using it. Ongoing work is exploring the potential for a market-based approach to take this to scale in a financially sustainable way.

AB  - Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are contiguous homozygous genomic segments that provide valuable insights into population history, selection pressures, and inbreeding levels. However, the global distribution of ROH and their implications for pig domestication and breeding are not yet fully understood. In this study, we analyzed whole-genome resequencing data from 1203 pigs across 49 breeds to characterize ROH patterns worldwide. European commercial pigs exhibited longer and more numerous ROH segments than Asian indigenous breeds, indicative of stronger artificial selection and higher inbreeding. Crossbreeding led to a reduction in ROH burden, with greater reductions observed when parental genetic divergence was larger. Notably, Asian and European pigs displayed distinct ROH islands, reflecting divergent selection pressures. Functional analysis revealed that these ROH islands were associated with growth, immunity, and reproduction. These findings enhance our understanding of the genetic diversity and selection history of global pig populations, providing valuable insights for future breeding strategies.

AB  - Introduction: Intercropping systems can be more productive than their respective monocultures and this positive net biodiversity effect is caused by complementarity and selection effects. While the complementarity effect is caused through resource partitioning or facilitation, the selection effect operates via the greater probability that a more diverse community contains a dominant and high-yielding species which will account for the majority of productivity in that community. Here, we investigated how light-use-related traits contribute to the net biodiversity effect via complementarity or selection effects and how these qrelationships change throughout an annual growing season.
   Materials and Methods: We conducted weekly destructive harvests to examine temporal dynamics of biodiversity effects in two crop mixtures (oat-lupin and oat-camelina) and their respective monocultures. We linked the biodiversity effects to traits related to light use (i.e., light interception, plant height, photosynthetic efficiency and photosynthetic capacity) and investigated how these relationships changed over time.
   Results: We found that the net biodiversity and selection effect increased over time in both mixtures, while complementarity effects increased only in the oat-lupin mixture. More intercepted light and taller plants in mixtures compared to monocultures positively contributed to biodiversity effects in both mixtures. Strategies for shade tolerance differed between the mixtures, that is, increased photosynthetic capacity and increased photosynthetic efficiency contributed to a positive net biodiversity effect in the oat-lupin and oat-camelina mixture, respectively.
   Conclusion: By linking the temporal dynamics of the net biodiversity effect and its two additive components to light-use-related traits in two different crop mixtures, this study demonstrates that complementary light use contributes to overyielding in intercropping systems. Such understanding is important for the design of effective intercropping systems and developing new crop cultivars suited to these environments.

AB  - Simple Summary: Small island environments can drive rapid changes in animal traits that provide an advantage for individuals attempting to capitalize on scarce resources. One such trait for lizards is bite force-individuals with stronger bites may be better able to access food that is hard to chew and/or guard access to food and territories from competitors. We introduced lizards to five small, uninhabited islets in Greece and tracked changes in the physical features and bite force of the lizards over several generations. We found changes in body size and bite force that suggested that competition was intense on these small islets; however, we did not see a consistent change in diet among these experimental populations. Our results suggest that competition is an important driver of changes in these traits, and changes in diet may be follow-on consequences. It remains to be discovered if diet is also a driver of these changes in other times of the year when food is especially limited. Some species can and do flexibly and rapidly change in response to changes in their environment.
   Resource-limited environments may drive the rapid evolution of phenotypic traits and ecological preferences optimizing the exploitation of resources. Very small islands are often characterized by reduced food availability, seasonal fluctuations in resources and strong unpredictability. These features may drive the evolution of phenotypic traits such as high bite forces, allowing animals to exploit a wider variety of the available resources. They may also lead to more generalist dietary patterns in response to food scarcity. However, the lack of predators and competitors on such small islands often also leads to high densities and the evolution of strong sexual dimorphism, which may also drive the evolution of bite force. Here, we take advantage of a unique replicated introduction experiment to test whether lizards introduced into very small islands alter their feeding ecology and use different resources, resulting in the evolution of a large body size, large head size and large bite forces. Our results show that three years after their introduction, the island lizards were larger and had greater bite forces and more pronounced sexual dimorphism. However, the diets were only marginally different between animals from the source population on a very large nearby island and those on the islets. Moreover, distinct differences in diet between animals on the different islets were observed, suggesting that the local environment is a strong driver of resource use. Overall, lizards with absolutely and relatively (adjusted for body size) large bite forces did eat larger and harder prey. Taken together, our data suggest that intraspecific competition is an important driver of the rapid evolution of bite force, which may allow these lizards to exploit the scarce and fluctuating resources on the islets. Whether or not lizards will evolve to include other types of food such as plants in their diet, facilitated by their large bite forces, remains to be explored in future studies.

AB  - Species invasions and range shifts can lead to novel host-parasite communities, but we lack general rules on which new associations are likely to form. While many studies examine parasite sharing among host species, the directionality of transmission is typically overlooked, impeding our ability to derive principles of parasite acquisition. Consequently, we analysed parasite records from the non-native ranges of 11 carnivore and ungulate species. Using boosted regression trees, we modelled parasite acquisition within each zoogeographic realm of a focal host's non-native range, using a suite of predictors characterizing the parasites themselves and the host community in which they live. We found that higher parasite prevalence among established hosts increases the likelihood of acquisition, particularly for generalist parasites. Non-native host species are also more likely to acquire parasites from established host species to which they are closely related; however, the acquisition of several parasite groups is biased to phylogenetically specialist parasites, indicating potential costs of parasite generalism. Statistical models incorporating these features provide an accurate prediction of parasite acquisition, indicating that measurable host and parasite traits can be used to estimate the likelihood of new host-parasite associations forming. This work provides general rules to help anticipate novel host-parasite associations created by climate change and other anthropogenic influences.

AB  - Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba; krill) and the pelagic tunicate (Salpa thompsoni; salps) are crucial to the Southern Ocean ecosystem, and krill supports the largest fishery in the Southern Ocean in term of catch. Given recent climatic changes in the northern Antarctic Peninsula (NAP), the distribution of krill and salps are shifting poleward. Unlike krill, salps thrive in warmer water temperatures and can form large blooms under favorable conditions, potentially outcompeting krill for resources. However, krill are ecologically more important, serving as a primary food source for higher trophic levels. The interspecific interactions, including hotspots and ecological niches, of krill and salps in the NAP were therefore investigated using historical datasets and species distribution models. We found that both spatial separation and overlap occurred between krill and salps hotspots, with the primary overlap occurring around Elephant Island. Furthermore, there was a significant overlap in their ecological niches, suggesting that they may have similar ecological requirements. This study emphasized the importance of krill and salps interactions in the Southern Ocean ecosystem. The krill habitat and therefore food web of the Southern Ocean could be influenced significantly if salps continue to shift poleward in the future. The information provided in this study aids in the conservation and management of the Southern Ocean ecosystem.

AB  - Research has shown that pigs from different regions exhibit varying responses to cold stimuli. Typically, cold stimuli induce browning of white adipose tissue mediated by adrenaline, promoting non-shivering thermogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying differential response of pig breeds to norepinephrine are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences and molecular mechanisms of the effects of norepinephrine (NE) treatment on adipocytes of Min pigs (a cold-resistant pig breed) and Duroc-Landrace-Yorkshire (DLY) pigs. Real time-qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence were performed following NE treatment on cell cultures of adipocytes originating from Min pigs (n = 3) and DLY pigs (n = 3) to assess the expressions of adipogenesis markers, beige fat markers, and mitochondrial biogenesis markers. The results showed that NE did not affect browning of adipocytes in DLY pigs, whereas promoted browning of adipocytes in Min pigs. Further, the expression of ADRB1 (Adrenoceptor Beta 1, ADRB1) was higher in subcutaneous adipose tissue and adipocytes of Min pigs than those of DLY pigs. Overexpression of ADRB1 in DLY pig adipocytes enhanced sensitivity to NE, exhibiting decreased adipogenesis markers, upregulated beige fat markers, and increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Conversely, adipocytes treated with ADRB1 antagonist in Min pigs resulted in decreased cellular sensitivity to NE. Further studies revealed differential CpG island methylation in ADRB1 promoter region, with lower methylation levels in Min pigs compared to DLY pigs. In conclusion, differential methylation of the ADRB1 promoter region leads to different ADRB1 expression, resulting in varying responsiveness to NE in adipocytes of two pig breeds. Our results provide new insights for further analysis of the differential cold responsiveness in pig breeds from different regions.

AB  - Population characteristics of the Barbary sheep Ammotragus lervia, the only wild caprine in Northwest Africa, were investigated in a captive population located in a 150-ha fenced area within the Amassine reserve, Morocco, created for promoting wildlife watching tourism. We analysed the population trend during 20 years since the introduction of 10 individuals in 1999. Using direct counting in March-April 2016 to 2019, before herd dispersal, we assessed population size, age-sex structure, birth and survival rates. We estimated survival rates from mortality analysis using exponential regression models. The population size exhibited fluctuations over time expressed by significant exponential equations. We observed three successive phases corresponding each to a fast-growing period followed by a sharp decline. Estimated population density ranged from 0.25 to 0.41 ind. ha-1. Adult sex ratio varied from 67 to 91 rams per 100 ewes. Juveniles and subadults comprised 27-43 % of the population, and adults, rams and ewes, represented 26-31 % and, 29-45 %, respectively. Birth rate varied from 14 to 73 lambs per 100 ewes. The survival rate during the postnatal year approximated 35 %. For adult rams, it was around 69 % year-1. Our findings would be helpful for developing a sustainable population management plan, and assessing potential reintroduction/restocking in other areas.

AB  - Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) are increasing worldwide, posing a threat to both humans and wildlife in terms of human injury and loss of wildlife. Understanding the temporal and spatial non-randomness of WVCs is an essential process for effective WVC management. Roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) is the most prevalent wildlife species in WVCs on Jeju Island, South Korea. This study analyzed individual temporal patterns and spatial hotspots (clusters) based on roe deer-vehicle collisions (RDVC) on Jeju Island from 2014 to 2017. RDVCs occur frequently from July to October, and RDVCs are higher in male deer than with females in all seasons, except in winter. The clusters in the high-risk periods were more regionally distributed compared to the clusters in the low-risk periods. Regardless of the period, some road sections have been identified as crucial clusters that should be given priority for road fencing to mitigate humandeer conflicts. Our findings could also provide road administrators with practical options for management such as temporarily imposing vehicle speed limits and installing signboards.

AB  - In tropical forests, drought and herbivory represent two potent stresses on seedlings. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of severe droughts in many tropical forests, which may influence seedling vulnerability to herbivores if drought stress affects seedling palatability. Furthermore, contrasting selective pressures in wetter vs drier forests could mean that species well-adapted to herbivores are less drought resistant and vice versa. In this study, we measured seedling performance and herbivory in a common garden experiment where seedlings of 15 tree species were subjected to irrigation or rainfall exclusion treatments across two dry seasons in Panama. Water manipulation had no effects on foliar herbivory during the experiment for all species combined and for 14 of the 15 focal species when analyzed separately. There was large variation among species in herbivore damage, but no relationship between the sensitivity of species to drought and the amount of herbivory they experienced. Altogether, our findings suggest that increasing drought stress is unlikely to directly alter tropical tree seedling susceptibility to herbivore attack in this forest. Additional studies are needed to determine whether drought alters tropical plant-herbivore interactions via other mechanisms, such as through changes in herbivorous insect communities and/or increases in fitness costs of herbivory. Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB  - The bats of Saudi Arabia consist of 30 species and 21 genera within 9 families (Pteropodidae, Rhinopomatidae, Rhinolophidae, Emballonuridae, Nycteridae, Hipposideridae, Miniopteridae, Molossidae, and Vespertilionidae). Some species have been recorded from only one locality: Epomophorus labiatus, Hipposideros megalotis and Asellia patrizii. The taxonomy of some species was updated. Details on the past and present distribution of the bats were included along with available data on their habitat preference and biology. An analysis of the bat fauna of Saudi Arabia revealed that they have six major zoogeographical affinities; Afrotropical (eight species), Saharo-Sindian (three species), Afrotropical-Palaearctic (four species), Palaearctic (four species), oriental (one species), and Afrotropical-oriental (two species). Asellia patrizii stands as an endemic species known only from Eretria, Ethiopia, and Farasan Island in Saudi Arabia, and Rhyneptesicus nasutus is considered as a Middle East endemic species with distribution confined to Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan, reaching as far as western Arabia. At least six more species are suspected to occur in Saudi Arabia, since they have been reported from neighboring Yemen. The threats to and conservation status of the bats of Saudi Arabia were highlighted.

AB  - Rapid growth of human populations in sub-Saharan Africa has led to a simultaneous increase in the number of livestock, often leading to conflicts of use with wildlife in protected areas. To minimize these conflicts, and to meet both communities' and conservation goals, it is therefore essential to monitor livestock density and their land use. This is usually done by conducting aerial surveys during which aerial images are taken for later counting. Although this approach appears to reduce counting bias, the manual processing of images is time-consuming. The use of dense convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has emerged as a very promising avenue for processing such datasets. However, typical CNN architectures have detection limits for dense herds and close -by animals. To tackle this problem, this study introduces a new point-based CNN architecture, HerdNet, inspired by crowd counting. It was optimized on challenging oblique aerial images containing herds of camels (Camelus dromedarius), donkeys (Equus asinus), sheep (Ovis aries) and goats (Capra hircus), acquired over heterogeneous arid landscapes of the Ennedi reserve (Chad). This approach was compared to an anchor-based architecture, Faster-RCNN, and a density-based, adapted version of DLA-34 that is typically used in crowd counting. HerdNet achieved a global F1 score of 73.6 % on 24 megapixels images, with a root mean square error of 9.8 animals and at a processing speed of 3.6 s, outperforming the two baselines in terms of localization, counting and speed. It showed better proximity-invariant precision while maintaining equivalent recall to that of Faster-RCNN, thus demonstrating that it is the most suitable approach for detecting and counting large mammals at close range. The only limitation of HerdNet was the slightly weaker identification of species, with an average confusion rate approximately 4 % higher than that of Faster-RCNN. This study provides a new CNN architecture that could be used to develop an automatic livestock counting tool in aerial imagery. The reduced image analysis time could motivate more frequent flights, thus allowing a much finer monitoring of livestock and their land use.

AB  - The Mazama genus is one of the more diverse genera among deer (Cervidae); its classification is controversial because of its complex phylogenetic relationships. The Central American red brocket deer (Mazama temama) is distributed from Central America to the northwest of South America. Studying the diet of mammals gives us information about the environment in which they live, considering that animals select food according to the resources available in the surrounding environment. Mesowear and microwear provide complementary data because they present direct evidence of feeding behaviour on different time scales. The use of extant animals as control samples or baselines allows for the interpretation of the results of a study performed using the archaeological record. For this reason, the aim of this paper was to study the diet of extant M. temama from Darien and to compare it with our previous results on ancient deer from Pedro Gonzalez Island archaeological site (6060-5620 cal yr BP) and extant individuals from San Jose Island (Panama). Evidence from the meso-and microwear analyses of M. temama from Darien suggests that they were browse-dominated mixed feeders during the last years of their lives and during the days before their death. There was no evidence of seasonal variation in their diets and between sexes. This paper exemplifies the potential of studying extant materials housed in museum collections as a reference to compare them to archaeological remains. The use of the same methods allows to construct baselines to better understand the archaeological record in the Neotropics.

AB  - When a plant is introduced to a new ecosystem it may escape from some of its coevolved herbivores. Reduced herbivore damage, and the ability of introduced plants to allocate resources from defence to growth and reproduction can increase the success of introduced species. This mechanism is known as enemy release and is known to occur in some species and situations, but not in others. Understanding the conditions under which enemy release is most likely to occur is important, as this will help us to identify which species and habitats may be most at risk of invasion. We compared in situ measurements of herbivory on 16 plant species at 12 locations within their native European and introduced Australian ranges to quantify their level of enemy release and understand the relationship between enemy release and time, space and climate. Overall, plants experienced approximately seven times more herbivore damage in their native range than in their introduced range. We found no evidence that enemy release was related to time since introduction, introduced range size, temperature, precipitation, humidity or elevation. From here, we can explore whether traits, such as leaf defences or phylogenetic relatedness to neighbouring plants, are stronger indicators of enemy release across species.

AB  - Animals adjust their habitat use patterns in response to changes in their physiological needs and environmental conditions. Understanding the mechanisms underlying resource selection and space use across time and space reveals effects of the environment on animals' decisions. We explored the effects of habitat availability and heterogeneity on the seasonal and annual space use and resource selection of two free-roaming feral burro (Equus asinus) populations in the United States within distinct climate and habitat conditions: the Sonoran Desert and the Colorado Plateau. As an introduced yet protected species in the United States, understanding burros' interactions with habitat elements is important for their conservation and management, as well as the conservation of sympatric wildlife. We used GPS locations of female burros (72 animals across both study areas) to delineate annual and seasonal ranges and resource selection patterns. We evaluated effects of mean and CV of habitat covariates, including forage, distance to water, and topography, representing availability and heterogeneity of resources, on seasonal and annual range size of burros. Moreover, we explored how burro seasonal and annual resource selection patterns were affected by availability and heterogeneity of resources. In the Sonoran Desert study area, burros had smaller seasonal and annual ranges and constant resource selection patterns across a year, likely due to a freshwater lake in the area, making water a nonlimiting resource. Human presence was the greatest factor affecting range size and resource selection in the Sonoran Desert, where burros selected for areas near roads and human recreation. In the Colorado Plateau study area, where resources were more seasonal, we found larger range sizes and fluctuating resource selection patterns compared to the Sonoran Desert population. Spatial variation in forage, water, and topography significantly affected range size of burros inhabiting the Colorado Plateau study area. Productive habitats with available water support smaller ranges and a more consistent pattern of resource selection. Our results highlight the positive effect of habitat heterogeneity and the negative effect of habitat productivity on range size of animals. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of habitat requirements for free-roaming burros that currently live under various climate and habitat conditions globally.

AB  - Translocations of Rhinocerotidae are commonly performed for conservation purposes but expose the animals to a variety of stressors (e.g. prolonged fasting, confinement, novel environment, etc.). Stress may change the composition of gut microbiota, which can impact animal health and welfare. White rhinoceroses in particular can develop anorexia, diarrhea and enterocolitis after translocation. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of age, sex and translocation on the rhinoceros' fecal bacterial microbiota composition. fecal samples were collected from rhinoceroses at capture (n = 16) and after a >30-hour road transport (n = 7). DNA was isolated from these samples and submitted for 16S rRNA V3-V4 phylotyping. Alpha diversity indices of the rhinoceros' fecal microbiota composition of different age, sex and before and after transport were compared using non-parametric statistical tests and beta diversity indices using Permutational Multivariate Analysis Of Variance (PERMANOVA). Resulting P-values were alpha-corrected (Padj.). Alpha and beta diversity did not differ between rhinoceroses of different age and sex. However, there was a significant difference in beta diversity between fecal samples collected from adult animals at capture and after transport. The most abundant bacterial phyla in samples collected at capture were Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (85.76%), represented by Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and Prevotellaceae families. The phyla Proteobacteria (Padj. = 0.009) and Actinobacteria (Padj. = 0.012), amongst others, increased in relative abundance from capture to after transport encompassing potentially pathogenic bacterial families such as Enterobacteriaceae (Padj. = 0.018) and Pseudomonadaceae (Padj. = 0.022). Important commensals such as Spirochaetes (Padj. = 0.009), Fibrobacteres (Padj. = 0.018) and Lachnospiraceae (Padj. = 0.021) decreased in relative abundance. These results indicate that the stressors associated with capture and transport cause an imbalanced fecal microbiota composition in white rhinoceroses that may lead to potentially infectious intestinal disorders. This imbalance may result from recrudescence of normally innocuous pathogens, increased shedding of pathogens or increased vulnerability to new pathogens.

AB  - Catastrophic megafires can increase extinction risks; identifying species priorities for management and policy support is critical for preparing and responding to future fires. However, empirical data on population loss and recovery post-fire, especially megafire, are limited and taxonomically biased. These gaps could be bridged if species' morphological, behavioural, ecological and life history traits indicated their fire responses. Using expert elicitation that estimated population changes following the 2019-20 Australian megafires for 142 terrestrial and aquatic animal species (from every vertebrate class, one invertebrate group), we examined whether expert es-timates of fire-related mortality, mortality in the year post-fire, and recovery trajectories over 10 years/three generations post-fire, were related to species traits. Expert estimates for fire-related mortality were lower for species that could potentially flee or shelter from fire, and that associated with fire-prone habitats. Post-fire mortality estimates were linked to diet, diet specialisation, home range size, and susceptibility to introduced herbivores that damage or compete for resources. Longer-term population recovery estimates were linked to diet/habitat specialisation, susceptibility to introduced species; species with slower life histories and shorter subadult dispersal distances also had lower recovery estimates. Across animal groups, experts estimated that recovery was poorest for species with pre-fire population decline and more threatened conservation status. Sustained management is likely needed to recover species with habitat and diet specialisations, slower life histories, pre-existing declines and threatened conservation statuses. This study shows that traits could help inform management priorities before and after future megafires, but further empirical data on animal fire response is essential.

AB  - A greater understanding of mite biodiversity and ecology can explain their preference for microhabitats within host bodies, i.e., as ecto-, meso-, and endoparasites. Similarly, learning about the patterns formed by mite communities in wild animals can shed light on the mechanisms of parasitosis development in their domesticated counterparts. Hence, the present study examined the acarofauna of the mouflon, introduced to Poland in the early 20th century from a region of endemic occurrence. Forty-one individuals were examined for the presence of ectoparasites between 2010 and 2013; later, skin fragments were analysed for the presence of skin mites. A new species of Demodecidae, Demodex musimonis sp. nov., was discovered in the skin of the pasterns of 14.6% mouflons, as well as the ectoparasitic tick Ixodes ricinus (prevalence 29.3%) and ungulate-typical fly Lipoptena cervi (34.1%). However, no mites typical for ovine Ovis (Psorergatidae, Psoroptidae) were noted, nor any colonisation of microhabitats by species from local ungulates, resulting from the loss of original parasites during the introduction. A comparison of the acarofauna of the mouflon and domestic sheep Ovis aries aries suggests that a mite community with a complex structure and the co-occurrence of different families may be formed. However, it is not known whether the acarofauna of domestic sheep is derived from wild ancestors or the process of domestication. Even so, the peculiar Demodecidae must have been part of the natural parasitofauna of wild sheep, of which only D. musimonis sp. nov. has been recognised so far.

AB  - Modern coexistence theory (MCT) holds the potential to study the ability of species to avoid extinction (i.e. to persist) across community types but is rarely applied beyond pairs of competing species. Here, we show that this limitation can be overcome by mapping species according to their niche () and fitness differences (). This application provides three main benefits to study processes of multispecies persistence across trophic levels. First, mapping introduces a novel categorization of species and communities according to the high-level processes at play: frequency dependence (negative or positive), the occurrence of positive species interactions (facilitation and mutualism) and whether persistence is possible without the presence of other species because of trophic interactions, such as herbivory or predation. Therefore, this mapping can be seen as a toolbox to describe how species persistence depends on species interactions. Second, mapping facilitates studying how species persistence responds to environmental changes that shift intrinsic growth rates and the strength and sign of species interactions. Third, mapping has the potential to foster synthesis across community types because it can accommodate co-occurrence of positive, negative and neutral interactions between species. We, therefore, argue that mapping can promote collaboration across sub-fields, as it provides a common concept to link disparate ecological communities.

AB  - Plant-Lepidoptera interactions are often studied using the pollination or herbivore networks only. Lepidoptera species are involved in two types of plant-insect interactions because they are herbivores as larvae and pollinators as adults. The study of entangled networks is critical, since the interaction of different networks can affect the overall network and community stability. Here, we studied the interaction of plants and Lepidoptera on the Yongxing Island, South China Sea. A plant-lepidopteran pollination network and a plant-lepidopteran herbivore network were built by using data from flower-pollinator and leaf-herbivore interactions. We then combined the two networks into a single network. We measured plant composition similarity within each sub-network and across sub-networks for Lepidoptera species. Our findings indicate that the plant-Lepidoptera pollination network and the herbivory network share significant proportions of Lepidoptera but small proportions of plant assemblages. The pollination network had higher nestedness and connectance than the herbivore network. Agrius convolvuli was the most specialized species, while Zizina otis had the highest species strength in the pollination network. Most Lepidoptera species were highly specialized in the herbivore network and their importance positively correlated across the two networks. Furthermore, there was no dietary composition similarity between the two networks for most Lepidoptera species. Our findings highlight the visible structural difference between the pollination and the herbivore networks. Adult Lepidoptera selects different plants for oviposition and feeding, a strategy that may benefit their reproduction and survival by sustaining adequate resources for their two life stages and the diversity of both plants and insects in oceanic island communities.

AB  - Mammalian body size diminution across the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene transition in the southern Levant has been much researched, with special focus on gazelle in Levantine Mediterranean zones. Explanations of body size diminutions in those cases include temperature increase and anthropogenic factors. This study examines body size shifts in three mammalian taxa - Gazella (gazelle), Lepus (hare) and Vulpes (fox) - between 24,000-7500 cal BP, in the steppic Azraq Basin of northeast Jordan. Osteometrics derive from 19 archaeological sites through the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene sequence. We use a 'Z-score' index of relative body size, and time-series analyses, to track body size shifts. All three taxa show relatively larger body size in the Late Pleistocene compared to the Early Holocene, with smallest Late Pleistocene sizes seen between 12,000-11,500 cal BP, during the Younger Dryas. While gazelles and hare recover size in our Early Holocene samples, they both show smaller sizes after 9000 cal BP. Similarity in size trends leads us to reject the influence of anthropogenic factors alone, in favour of ecological and climatic factors. We attribute the sharp size decrease in gazelles in the Late Neolithic, 9000-7500 cal BP, to inter-specific size change, and the addition of a smaller Arabian species better adapted to the warmer arid post 8.2 kya conditions. Patterns for fox, albeit on small sample sizes, also hint at species turnover but in the Late Pleistocene. For hare, we track size decrease between the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene as possible intra-specific diminution. Combined results argue for mammalian taxa experiencing complex responses to shifting ecological conditions in the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene. Body size trends in the Azraq Basin appear counter to the expectations of Bergmann's rule of thermoregulation. We propose instead that forage conditions, and resource availability and limitations are better fit drivers of mammalian body size adaptations and turnover (including species distribution shifts) in this semi-arid case study region.

AB  - Animal Feeding Operations or AFOs, such as beef feedlots, dairy farms, and hog farms, are associated with elevated levels of harmful fine particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5). The geographic distribution of AFOs in the United States is not well-documented, hindering efforts to identify affected communities and assess health impacts from this pollution. This study introduces the most comprehensive spatial database of these operations available for the United States, composed of 8763 cattle operations and 6963 hog farms, and clarifies their influence on particulate matter concentrations. Results reveal a high geographic concentration, with just thirty counties containing roughly 25% of all identified feeding operations. PM2.5 levels are significantly higher in census tracts with these operations than in those without: 28% higher in tracts with cattle operations and 11% higher in tracts with hog farms. Pollution burdens disproportionately affect socially vulnerable, minority populations with limited health insurance coverage, underscoring the need for targeted interventions.

AB  - Fire, herbivores, and climatic factors are all major drivers of savanna and grassland dynamics, and they interact in complex ways, which are still in the process of being explored. In particular, herbivores can reduce fire intensity by removal of biomass, and this could be reinforced by herbivores' attraction to recently burned sites, although grassland resilience may limit the temporal depth of such effects. Fire temperature is the most common fire metric reported for grassland fire, but additional aspects of fire behavior can also be measured. Using a set of controlled, replicated experiments, we examined the effects of year of burn, herbivory by livestock and wildlife, previous burn, and weather history on fire behavior in an African savanna. Multiple measures of fire behavior (minimum fire temperature, flame front speed, fire residence time, maximum flame height, and flame length) in 36 controlled burns were positively intercorrelated. Burns conducted in 2018 were significantly cooler, especially at heights >0.5 m above the ground, than those in 2013, a wetter year with more grass fuel. Grass fuel loads and fire temperatures were reduced by the presence of livestock and wildlife. Our sampling methods did not for the most part reveal expected differences in fire temperatures or other behaviors between the reburned plots and those burned for the first time in 2018, with or without herbivores, suggesting strong postfire resilience in this semiarid savanna rangeland.

AB  - The continuous expansion of global road networks, driven by increasing human populations, poses an emerging threat to animal populations through vehicle collisions. This study identifies the causal factors and hotspots of animal roadkill along a 72 km stretch of the Nairobi-Mombasa Highway (from Kyumvi to Sultan-Hamud) and recommends appropriate mitigation measures to enhance wildlife conservation. Data on roadkill incidents were collected from 2013 to 2018 through road patrols conducted by field scouts. Environmental variables, including water points, corners, vegetation, culverts, migratory routes, settlements, slopes, land use, and fences, were gathered using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. A presence-absence binary logistic regression model within a GIS environment was employed to identify significant environmental drivers of roadkill and to map hotspots. A total of 408 roadkill incidents (0.944 roadkill km-1 y-1) were recorded, comprising 51 species from six animal groups. Wild herbivores (13 species) and carnivores (14 species) constituted the majority of the documented wildlife, with a density of 0.204 and 0.157 fatalities per kilometre of road per year, respectively. Roadkill incidents for all species combined were significantly higher in areas near migratory routes, settlements, culverts, and corners, while they were lower in grassland, dwarf shrub grassland, open shrub areas, and near fences. However, the roadkill of different animal groups was influenced by distinct sets of factors. Most roadkill hotspots were located between Konza Center and Salama Town, with birds having the shortest stretch and herbivores and carnivores having the longest stretches. Roadkill can be mitigated by establishing road signs, fences, speed bumps, overpasses, and underpasses, and maintaining a cleared vegetation zone along the road. These findings can assist wildlife managers and infrastructure engineers in incorporating wildlife welfare and the concerns and attitudes of local communities when planning and developing linear infrastructure projects.

AB  - We show that one population of red kangaroos outside the dingo barrier fence has fewer females and joeys, and also grows up faster than a neighboring population that is protected by the fence. We argue that the impacts of contrasting predation pressures across the fence, for kangaroos and other prey, need further investigation.
   Decommissioning the dingo barrier fence has been suggested to reduce destructive dingo control and encourage a free transfer of biota between environments in Australia. Yet the potential impacts that over a century of predator exclusion might have had on the population dynamics and developmental biology of prey populations has not been assessed. We here combine demographic data and both linear and geometric morphometrics to assess differences in populations among 166 red kangaroos (Osphranter rufus)-a primary prey species of the dingo-from two isolated populations on either side of the fence. We also quantified the differences in aboveground vegetation biomass for the last 10 years on either side of the fence. We found that the age structure and growth patterns, but not cranial shape, differed between the two kangaroo populations. In the population living with a higher density of dingoes, there were relatively fewer females and juveniles. These individuals were larger for a given age, despite what seems to be lower vegetation biomass. However, how much of this biomass represented kangaroo forage is uncertain and requires further on-site assessments. We also identified unexpected differences in the ontogenetic trajectories in relative pes length between the sexes for the whole sample, possibly associated with male competition or differential weight-bearing mechanics. We discuss potential mechanisms behind our findings and suggest that the impacts of contrasting predation pressures across the fence, for red kangaroos and other species, merit further investigation.

AB  - Context. Vehicle collisions with wildlife can injure or kill animals, threaten human safety, and threaten the viability of rare species. This has led to a focus in road-ecology research on identifying the key predictors of 'road-kill' risk, with the goal of guiding management to mitigate its impact. However, because of the complex and context-dependent nature of the causes of risk exposure, modelling road-kill data in ways that yield consistent recommendations has proven challenging. Aim. Here we used a multi-model machine-learning approach to identify the spatiotemporal predictors, such as traffic volume, road shape, surrounding vegetation and distance to human settlements, associated with road-kill risk. Methods. We collected data on the location, identity and wildlife body size of each road mortality across four seasons along eight roads in southern Tasmania, a 'road-kill hotspot' of management concern. We focused on three large-bodied and frequently affected crepuscular Australian marsupial herbivore species, the rufous-bellied pademelon (Thylogale billardierii), Bennett's wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) and the bare-nosed wombat (Vombatus ursinus). We fit the point-location data using 'lasso-regularisation' of a logistic generalised linear model (LL-GLM) and out-of-bag optimisation of a decision-tree-based 'random forests' (RF) algorithm for optimised predictions. Results. The RF model, with high-level feature interactions, yielded superior out-of-sample prediction results to the linear additive model, with a RF classification accuracy of 84.8% for the 871 road-kill observations and a true skill statistic of 0.708, compared with 61.2% and 0.205 for the LL-GLM. The lasso rejected road visibility and human density, ranking roadside vegetation type and presence of barrier fencing as the most influential predictors of road-kill locality. Conclusions. Forested areas with no roadside barrier fence along curved sections of road posed the highest risk to animals. Seasonally, the frequency of wildlife-vehicle collisions increased notably for females during oestrus, when they were more dispersive and so had a higher encounter rate with roads. Implications. These findings illustrate the value of using a combination of attributive and predictive modelling using machine learning to rank and interpret a complexity of possible predictors of road-kill risk, as well as offering a guide to practical management interventions that can mitigate road-related hazards.

AB  - The research of 26 -year -old mixed plantations of Siberian spruce and Siberian stone pine cultivated by biogroups of about 300 pcs/ha (2-5 stone pine seedlings alternating 4-9 spruce seedlings in a row) has shown that the damage rate by moose to them is much lower than to pure stone pine plantations or the mixed ones of Siberian stone pines and Scots pines we have studied before. The share of biogroups containing damaged stone pine trees is 18 %. A third of this number is plantations with damage to all the trees. This is most pronounced in biogroups of 4 to 5 stone pines as well as in case of frequent alternation of biogroups in a row. 76 % living stone pines have been preserved (89.3 % of them without damage to the stem). About two thirds of them (about 500 pcs/ha) grow in the crown of spruce trees adjacent to stone pine biogroups. Prolonged exposure to growing in a spruce tree crown negatively affects the growth of a stone pine's central shoot and crown. We are the first in the Middle Urals to propose a scheme for cultivating sustained productive mixed plantations of Siberian stone pines and Siberian spruce trees (or Norway spruce trees). Stone pines are planted in biogroups of 2-3 seedlings, beginning the planting strictly on one side of the site. The first biogroup in odd -numbered rows (1, 2, 3, 5, etc.) is planted after 3 spruce seedlings from the beginning of the row, the second and subsequent biogroups in these rows - after 9 spruce seedlings. The first biogroup in even -numbered rows (2, 4, 6, 8, etc.) is planted after 9 spruce seedlings from the beginning of the row, maintaining this sequence until the end of the row. Every row in mixed plantations is concluded with planting no less than 3 spruce seedlings. During silvicultural treatment procedures natural regeneration is completely removed: softwoods - by mechanical means, and hard woods - by ringing or injection of environmentally friendly water -based chemicals. These measures reduce or eliminate the appearance of coppice and, accordingly, food reserve for wild animals. Spruce trees adjacent to stone pine biogroups are cut down while lightening and thinning, which creates the possibility for the growth of stone pines. The proposed method for cultivating plantations of Siberian stone pines and Siberian spruce trees has been patented. It can be introduced into silvicultural practice in the taiga zone where stone pines are grown.

AB  - To more effectively protect biodiversity and promote sustainable development, transfrontier conservation areas (TFCAs) aim to enhance wildlife flows across national borders. This is true of the world's largest terrestrial TFCA, the Kavango-Zambezi (KAZA), home to half of Africa's savannah elephants that move across five countries in a mixed-use landscape. We used GPS tracking data from >100 collared elephants to evaluate how fences between Namibia and Botswana impact transboundary connectivity in KAZA. For female elephants these fences formed an impenetrable boundary, with no exchange between animals collared in Botswana and those collared in Namibia. Male elephants did cross border fences, although they remained a partial boundary, with 7 of 21 males accounting for most crossings. Our results suggest a review of fence alignment and de-commissioning of some fencing separating Namibia and Botswana, combined with increased support for fence-free interventions that reduce wildlife-livestock interactions, should be considered to meet the objectives of KAZA.

AB  - Because of climate change, heavy precipitation is likely to become frequent and intense, thereby increasing the risk of shigellosis occurrence. However, few studies examined the impact of heavy precipitation on shigellosis and its impact modifiers in developed countries. This study aims to analyze the association between heavy precipitation and shigel-losis in Taiwan, and to identify the vulnerable population and impact modifiers. We adopted a case-crossover design, and used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for shigellosis occurrence. Information were col-lected on the daily shigellosis cases, precipitation, temperature, and typhoons from 1994 to 2015, and yearly data of medical resources and environmental factors were obtained at the city level from 1998 to 2015. Stratification analyses were performed by age, sex, medical resource, and environmental factors. We discovered that heavy precipitation >= 80 mm/day considerably increased the risk of shigellosis occurrence. The ORs of heavy rain (80 to <200 mm/ day) were 2.08-2.26 at lags 0-1. The ORs of extremely heavy rain (>= 200 mm/day) increased to 2.17-4.73 at lags 5-8. Moreover, the effect of heavy precipitation was greater under high temperature condition (>= 23.6 degrees C). Adults were more susceptible to heavy-precipitation-associated shigellosis, especially the elderly. Males experienced margin-ally higher effects than females did. Moreover, cities with more medical resources and forest cover and higher percent-age of completed storm sewers had lower effects; however, dense population and higher pig density were the risk factors. Although the high water-supply penetration rate did not decrease Shigella infection after heavy precipitation, it did lower the risk of typhoon-related shigellosis. In conclusion, hot temperature could enhance the impact of heavy precipitation on shigellosis. Public health interventions should be introduced according to the lag period after heavy precipitation, particularly in areas with high population density, proportion of elderly people, and pig density. The improvement of medical resources and tree cover as well as the construction of storm sewers and piped water systems might be mitigation measures that can be considered.

AB  - Population density estimates are important for wildlife conservation and management. Several camera trapping-based methods for estimating densities have been developed, one of which, the random encounter model (REM), has been widely applied due to its practical advantages such as no need for species-specific study design. Nevertheless, most of the studies in which REM has been assessed against referenced methods have sampled one population, precluding evaluation of the circumstances under which REM does or does not perform well. At this point, a review of all REM assessments could be useful to provide an overview of method reliability and highlight the main factors determining REM performance. Here we used a combination of literature review and empirical study to compare the performance of REM with independent methods. We reviewed 34 studies where REM was applied to 45 species, reporting 77 REM-reference density comparisons; and we also sampled 13 populations (ungulates and lagomorphs) in which we assessed REM performance against independent densities. The results suggested that appropriate procedures to estimate REM parameters (namely day range, detection zone and encounter rate) are mandatory to obtain unbiased densities. Deficient estimates of day range and encounter rate lead to an overestimation of density, while deficient estimates of detection zone conducted to underestimations. Finally, the precision achieved by REM was lower than reference methods, mainly because of the high levels of spatial aggregation observed in natural populations. In this situation, simulation-based results suggest that c. 60 camera placements should be sampled to achieve acceptable precision (i.e. coefficient of variation below 0.20). The wide range of situations and scenarios included in this study allow us to conclude that REM is a reliable method for estimating wildlife population density when using appropriate estimates of REM parameters and sampling designs. Overall, these results pave the way to wider application of REM for monitoring terrestrial mammals.

AB  - Simple Summary As invasive insect species can disrupt agriculture, ecosystem functions, and human health, monitoring the spread of newly invasive insects is a high priority. The purple carrot-seed moth Depressaria depressana, a European species first reported in North America in 2008, specializes on reproductive structures of taxa throughout the family Apiaceae and thus presents a potential threat to native North American umbellifers. We assessed interpopulational genetic diversity of D. depressana across its eastern North American invasion front and compared those values to available data for European populations. We also compared this diversity with genetic diversity estimates for populations of Depressaria radiella (parsnip webworm), a European species introduced to North America more than 160 years ago that is essentially restricted to two apiaceous genera throughout its native and invasive ranges. Documenting the historical spread of D. radiella with museum and literature records, we found D. depressana displays greater genetic diversity than D. radiella and is colonizing North America more rapidly; greater genetic diversity may facilitate faster colonization via establishment on a wider range of hostplants. The contrast in colonization by these two species may inform management practices for invasive insects utilizing a broad versus narrow array of hosts within a single plant family. Depressaria depressana, the purple carrot seed moth, is a Eurasian species first reported in North America in 2008 and currently undergoing range expansion. This invasion follows that of its Eurasion congener Depressaria radiella (parsnip webworm), first documented in North America 160 years ago. Unlike D. depressana, which utilizes hostplants across multiple tribes of Apiaceae, Depressaria radiella is a "superspecialist" effectively restricted in its native and non-indigenous ranges to two closely related apiaceous genera. We investigated the genetic structure of D. depressana populations across latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in the eastern United States by constructing COI haplotype networks and then comparing these with haplotype networks constructed from available COI sequence data from contemporary European D. depressana populations and from European and North American D. radiella populations. Haplotype data revealed higher genetic diversity in D. depressana, indicating high dispersal capacity, multiple introductions, and/or a genetically diverse founding population. Museum and literature records of D. radiella date back to 1862 and indicate that range expansion to the West Coast required more than 50 years. Higher levels of genetic diversity observed in D. depressana compared to its congener may indicate a greater propensity for dispersal, colonization and establishment in its non-indigenous range.

AB  - Marine turtles are a group of imperiled marine megafauna particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors. Most long-term studies of marine turtles are based on nesting surveys which focus on numbers of eggs, hatchlings, and nesting females. However, we know less about long-term abundance trends of immature and adult turtles in the marine environment. To address this data gap, we examined records from 35,000 underwater visual census (UVC) dives (1993-2019) and short-term in-water turtle survey data (2009-2014) at Cocos Island, Costa Rica. During UVCs, trained divemasters from UnderSea Hunter recorded observations of two species of marine turtles-green Chelonia mydas and hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata. Our short-term in-water surveys revealed that most turtles at Cocos are greens, but both immature and mature greens occur at Cocos. We analyzed long-term UVC data using a hierarchical modeling approach and we modeled a 26% decrease in the relative abundance of turtles observed on dives each year. Our model also revealed potential interactions between tiger sharks and turtles, finding that for each additional tiger shark present during a dive, the predicted relative abundance of turtles decreased by 43%. Lastly, our model suggested the influence of environmental variation on marine turtle relative abundance; a 1 degrees C increase in sea surface temperature (SST) decreased the predicted relative abundance of turtles by 7%. Our results suggest that marine turtles are sensitive to long-term environmental and oceanographic changes, and potentially avoid certain areas to reduce exposure to tiger sharks. Given our study area is already protected, there needs to be more focus on protecting adult turtles during their movements across the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Our work also highlights the importance of long-term underwater surveys to monitor adult turtles.
   Analysis of 22 years of marine turtle in-water surveys revealed significant declines in relative abundance, despite protection within the survey area. This work provides important insights into long-term population trends of Endangered green and hawksbill turtles in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, and uses a series of mixed models to examine environmental and ecological factors which may relate to the observed decline of marine turtles. image

AB  - The sika deer population on Yakushima Island exhibits high genetic diversity despite the small size of the island. We hypothesized that the high genetic diversity of the population had been maintained by the population structure, which included several subpopulations among which gene flow was limited. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the spatial genetic structure of the population using 12 microsatellite loci. Two and four subpopulations were detected by STRUCTURE (stN and stS) and GENELAND (glN, glE, glS, and glW) software, respectively. The basic genetic structure assigned by STRUCTURE was supported by GENELAND, while stN and stS were further separated into two subpopulations (glN and glE; glS and glW, respectively) by GENELAND. All pairwise genetic differentiations between the two and four subpopulations were significant. These results demonstrated that the Yakushima population was structured into genetically distinct subpopulations. Although the location of the western boundary between stN and stS corresponded with a large river, no landscape or biological feature could be identified for the eastern boundary. We discussed the relationships between the genetic structure and management units designed by the local government and concluded that the Yakushima population should be managed based on their spatial population structures considering multiple time scales.

AB  - Baculoviruses are a group of entomopathogenic viruses that are important natural enemies of insects, particularly lepidopteran larvae. An important component of baculovirus transmission efficiency is the frequency with which hosts encounter patchily distributed virions on plants. Little is known about the ecology and bacterial composition of virus-killed cadavers. We used a baculovirus and host Trichoplusia ni caterpillars to study the effects of virus-killed cadavers on tomato plant defenses and T. ni behavior. We also compared bacterial communities associated with virus-killed and uninfected (freeze-killed) cadavers and found that there was no significant difference in community composition and membership between tomato-fed virus-killed or freeze-killed cadavers. Comparison of virus-killed cadavers from two separate experiments revealed significant differences in bacterial community composition, suggesting that host plant could play a more important role in shaping bacterial communities than virus infection status. Culture-dependent plating indicated that virus-killed cadavers had significantly higher bacterial titers compared with uninfected cadavers. We found that virus-killed cadavers suppressed polyphenol oxidase activity, an important plant defense protein, in mechanically damaged plants, but not in plants damaged by herbivory. Although cadavers did not influence plant defenses induced by feeding damage inflicted by healthy or infected T. ni, this study provides the first evidence that baculoviruses could influence plant defenses through host cadavers. When applied to intact plants, neither virus-killed or freeze-killed cadavers influenced T. ni oviposition, larval choice, or larval consumption, indicating these insects did not discriminate cadaver cues. Virus-killed cadavers could play important roles in mediating interactions between plants, herbivores, and other trophic levels, with potential implications for viral transmission dynamics.

AB  - The submerged plant species Carolina fanwort (Cabomba caroliniana) has become a dominant invasive aquatic plant in the Lake Taihu Basin (LTB) in China. Introduced species may escape their original specialist enemies and encounter fewer enemies in their new environment. They were assumed to have suffered less herbivory than native species as they are relatively unpalatable (the enemy release hypothesis [ERH]). The objective of this study was to compare the responses of C. caroliniana with those of co-occurring native species to herbivory from native herbivores. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to record the responses of C. caroliniana and two commonly co-occurring native submerged plant counterparts, water thyme (Hydrilla verticillata) and Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), to herbivory by two native generalist gastropod snails, Radix swinhoei and Sinotaia quadrata. Plant morphological traits (total biomass, shoot/root [S/R] biomass ratio and relative growth rate [RGR]) and physiological traits (leaf total nonstructural carbohydrate [TNC], lignin, and cellulose) were recorded. The snail S. quadrata rarely influenced the plant traits of the three submerged plants. With the increasing numbers of R. swinhoei treatments, most of the plant traits of H. verticillata and M. spicatum changed, while those of C. caroliniana showed a relatively stable fluctuation. This result indicates that C. caroliniana is more resistant to herbivory by the snail R. swinhoei, which is consistent with the ERH hypothesis. This finding indicates that herbivorous snail species contributes to the invasion of C. caroliniana, which potentially alters the species composition of submerged plants in the plant community.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate and compare seasonal variations of Hippocampus reidi population structures in two Brazilian coastal areas. Samples were collected from the rocky shores of Urca and Duas Irmas Island by freediving along fixed transects. All seahorses observed in the study were recorded, measured, and identified by sex and reproductive stage. Seahorse behavior and fish depth were also registered. All individuals were photo-identified to estimate recapture rates. Holdfast used by seahorses was also recorded. Results showed low densities at both sites; sex ratio and juvenile/adult proportion did not appear to vary with season. The seahorse height differed between the two areas but did not vary with season nor sex. Seahorses in both sites were found in shallow waters (i.e. up to 4 meters), and the depth did not vary by season nor sex. Males were more frequently recaptured than females in both areas. All seahorses were reproductively active year-round, peaking at rainy periods in both areas. The seahorses were more often recorded while resting and seemed to anchor on seaweed. Though in different bays, seahorse population structure and seasonality appeared similar. These data provide useful baseline data for future population assessments.

AB  - The benchmarking of farm environmental sustainability and the monitoring of progress towards more sustainable farming systems is made difficult by the need to aggregate multiple indicators at the relevant spatial scales. We present a novel framework for identifying alternative pathways to improve environmental sustainability in farming systems that addresses this challenge by analysing the co-variance of indicators within a landscape context. A set of sustainability indicators was analysed within the framework of a published set of Farm Management Archetypes (FMAs) that maps the distribution of farming systems in England based on combinations of environmental and management variables. The archetype approach acknowledges that sustainability indicators do not vary independently and that there are regional constraints to potential trajectories of change. Using Pareto Optimisation, we identified optimal combinations of sustainability indicators ("Pareto nodes") for each FMA independently, and across all FMAs. The relative sustainability of the archetypes with respect to one another was compared based on the proportion of Pareto nodes in each FMA. Potential for improvement in sustainability was derived from distances to the nearest Pareto node (either within or across FMAs), incorporating the cost of transitioning to another archetype based on the similarity of its environmental variables. The indicators with the greatest potential to improve sustainability within archetypes (and, therefore, should have a greater emphasis in guiding management decisions) varied between FMAs. Relatively unsustainable FMAs were identified that also had limited potential to increase within archetype sustainability, indicating regions where more fundamental system changes may be required. The FMA representing the most intensive system of arable production, although relatively unsustainable when compared to all other archetypes, had the greatest internal potential for improvement without transitioning to a different farming system. In contrast, the intensive horticulture FMA had limited internal potential to improve sustainability. The FMAs with the greatest potential for system change as a viable pathway to improved sustainability were dairy, beef and sheep, and rough grazing, moving towards more mixed systems incorporating arable. Geographically, these transitions were concentrated in the west of England, introducing diversity into otherwise homogenous landscapes. Our method allows for an assessment of the potential to improve sustainability across spatial scales, is flexible relative to the choice of sustainability indicators, and-being data-driven-avoids the subjectivity of indicator weightings. The results allow decision makers to explore the opportunity space for beneficial change in a target landscape based on the indicators with most potential to improve sustainability.

AB  - Like many African countries, balancing conservation goals with the livelihoods of forest-dependent communities remains a persistent challenge in Ghana's Bia Biosphere Reserve (BBR). Usually, conservation policies sideline local knowledge, creating tensions between ecological preservation and economic survival. This study examines how integrating local perspectives into forest governance can bridge these gaps, fostering policies that support biodiversity and community well-being. The study gathered insights from 100 participants across five forestdependent communities using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. Thematic analysis uncovered three critical challenges in aligning conservation goals with forest livelihood needs. First is the erosion of traditional ecological practices that have historically sustained biodiversity and local livelihoods. Second, the deepening of economic hardship due to restrictive conservation measures and inadequate access to viable alternative income sources. Third, persistent governance failures are marked by inequitable policy enforcement and the systematic exclusion of marginalized voices from decision-making processes. Given the government of Ghana's formal recognition of traditional knowledge, this study recommends that these commitments be deepened. Specifically, efforts must be directed toward a more robust integration of traditional ecological knowledge, strengthening local governance structures, and expanding genuinely participatory decision-making mechanisms to ensure inclusive and adaptive conservation outcomes. The study underscores the urgent need to redefine conservation as a collaborative pursuit that balances ecological sustainability with human well-being. This calls for inclusive policies integrating local knowledge, promoting sustainable livelihoods, and safeguarding economic security. Future research should explore the long-term viability and scalability of such integrative conservation models through cross-regional, mixed-methods, and longitudinal studies, thereby deepening our understanding of how localized strategies can inform broader policy frameworks that are both ecologically sound and socially just.

AB  - Italy has a long history of sheep breeding and counts several local populations that may represent a unique source of genetic diversity. Among these, Nera del Mela is a sheep genetic resource historically reared in Sicily but not officially recognised as a breed. In this study, we genotyped 36 individuals of Nera del Mela using the OvineSNP50K array, in order to estimate the genetic diversity and evaluate the population structure and relatedness with other Italian sheep breeds. Genetic diversity indices, and inbreeding estimated from runs of homozygosity (F-ROH) revealed a moderate level of variability. Runs of homozygosity islands mapped candidate genes involved in the adaptation to local environment and immune response. Population genetic analyses using different approaches highlighted the hypothesis that this sheep possesses a defined genetic structure, especially if compared with other recognised breeds, despite the influence of other populations such as the Sicilian breeds. Overall, our findings represent a starting point for the possible official acknowledgement of this population, for the creation of a conservation plan, and thus for preserving this genomic heritage.

AB  - When introduced to new ecosystems, species' populations often grow immediately postrelease. Some introduced species, however, maintain a low population size for years or decades before sudden, rapid population growth is observed. Because exponential population growth always starts slowly, it can be difficult to distinguish species experiencing the early phases of slow exponential population growth (inherent lags) from those with actively delayed growth rates (prolonged lags). Introduced ungulates provide an excellent system in which to examine lags, because some introduced ungulate populations have demonstrated rapid population growth immediately postintroduction, while others have not. Using studies from the literature, we investigated which exotic ungulate species and populations (n = 36) showed prolonged population growth lags by comparing the doubling time of real ungulate populations to those predicted from exponential growth models for theoretical populations. Having identified the specific populations that displayed prolonged lags, we examined the impacts of several environmental and biological variables likely to influence the length of lag period. We found that seventeen populations (47%) showed significant prolonged population growth lags. We could not, however, determine the specific factors that contributed to the length of these lag phases, suggesting that these ungulate populations' growth is idiosyncratic and difficult to predict. Introduced species that exhibit delayed growth should be closely monitored by managers, who must be proactive in controlling their growth to minimize the impact such populations may have on their environment.

AB  - This research assesses the environmental uses of Haleakala Crater, and adjoining east Maui areas, by native Hawaiians during recent centuries, and evaluates the modern utilization of this volcanic depression. The study methods examine, and focus on, numerous historical and modern accounts and reports. Three historical periods were identified as follows: (1). A phase, from the similar to 1400s until contact with foreigners in 1778, characterized by the development of settlements, population expansion, the intensification of traditional agriculture, and the political consolidation of Maui. The construction of the Kiha-a-Pi'i-lani trail across the crater enhanced travel between distant island areas. (2). Following the collapse of Maui's human populations during the late 1700s, and until the 20th century, came a period distinguished by scientific exploration of the crater, and intentional or accidental introductions of animals, including goats, horses, cattle, and wild dogs. (3). After Haleakala became a National Park in 1916, efforts to eradicate introduced animals and to encourage the reproduction of silverswords and other plants were initiated. Unfortunately, in retrospect, construction of a modern paved road, improvement of hiking trails, and building of facilities allowed swift access to the Park and substantially increased tourist numbers, up to similar to 2 million yearly visitors. Faced with such crowds, the long-term planning of Park resources appears to be a formidable task.

AB  - High post-settlement mortality in ex situ sexually propagated coral recruits remains a significant bottleneck to production of corals for reef restoration, scientific experiments and the ornamental trade. Co-culture with grazing herbivores represents a potentially cost-effective method to reduce recruit competition with algae, thus improving the survival and yield of corals. Here we examined the effectiveness of co-culture of coral recruits of Acropora millepora, A. tenuis, A. secale, Porites lobata and Platygyra daedalea with herbivorous gastropods, Calthalotia strigata and Turbo haynesi, and herbivorous juveniles of the Asteroid Acanthaster cf. solaris. Coral recruits (200 per species) were settled onto individual aragonite plugs, with 10 plugs per species introduced to twenty 50 L experimental tanks. Each tank was randomly assigned to one of five grazing treatments; (1) Thalotia, 30 C. strigata per tank, (2) Turbo, 30 T. haynesi per tank, (3) CoTS, 30 A. cf. solaris per tank, (4) Mix, 10 C. strigata, 10 T. haynesi and 20 A. cf. solaris per tank, and (5) Control, no grazers added. We found that over a 2-month period single species co-culture with C. strigata significantly improved the survival of A. millepora, A. tenuis, A. secale and P. lobata, whilst P. daedalea benefitted most from co-culture with T. haynesi. Over 6-months, C. strigata produced the highest survival in A. millepora (51.6% +/- 5.24%), A. tenuis (46.6% +/- 3.16%) and A. secale (38.5% +/- 3.48%), but T. haynesi co-culture resulted in higher survival in P. lobata (67.3% +/- 3.76%) and P. daedalea (100% +/- 0%). These results were all significantly higher than the survival of corals in controls, which after 6 months averaged similar to 1.87% for the Acropora species, 43.0% +/- 4.79% and 57.6% +/- 8.60% for P. lobata and P. daedalea respectively. Increase in basal surface area of recruits was varied, with the highest relative increases in recruit basal disk area occurring in Thalotia treatments for A. millepora and A. secale, in Turbo for A. tenuis, and in the Control tanks for P. lobata and P. daedalea. This study provides strong evidence that co-culture with C. strigata can improve ex situ sexual coral propagation, with minimal additional intervention from aquarists. The large increase (23.6x higher) in survival of ecologically and economically important coral species such as A. millepora demonstrates the potential of co-culture to enhance ex situ coral propagation.

AB  - Lady (= ladybird) beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) provide agroecosystem services as major predators of aphids and other pests of field crops. Several native coccinellids in North America have declined in association with the introduction of invasive species of lady beetles. In particular, populations of three native species declined drastically (Coccinella transversoguttata richardsoni) or effectively disappeared (Coccinella novemnotata, Adalia bipunctata) from agricultural landscapes in eastern South Dakota, U.S.A., following establishment of an invasive coccinellid (Coccinella septempunctata) in the 1980s. Since then, two other non-native coccinellids (Harmonia axyridis and Hippodamia variegata) have established in eastern South Dakota, but long-term analysis of their impact on the aphidophagous coccinellid guild is lacking. This paper summarizes long-term results from 14 years (2007-2020) of sampling coccinellids by sweepnet and timed searches in five field crops and restored prairie in eastern South Dakota. In all, 17,338 aphidophagous coccinellids comprising 10 species were sampled. Two invasive species (Coc. septempunctata, Har. axyridis) were the third- and fourth-most abundant species, respectively. The seven most abundant species constituted 99% of all coccinellids sampled and were recorded from all six habitats. However, coccinellid species ranged considerably in their evenness of habitat use, resulting in differences in rank abundance among habitats. Coccinellid assemblages were similar for alfalfa and winter wheat, but not for other habitats, which possessed distinct coccinellid assemblages based on rank abundance. Annual abundance of coccinellids varied considerably within habitats, but declining trends were evident from significant negative regressions in annual abundance for adult and immature coccinellids in corn and adults in soybean. As a group, native adult coccinellids showed a significant declining trend in corn but not in other habitats, whereas trends for non-native adult coccinellids were non-significant in all habitats. Sample rates of coccinellids in alfalfa, spring grains, and corn in this study were 74, 26, and 6%, respectively, compared to that of a previous study from the region, further indicating substantial decreases in coccinellid abundance. Possible explanations and implications for observed patterns in coccinellid diversity and individual species abundances in field crops and restored prairie of eastern South Dakota are discussed with respect to prey, agronomic trends, and landscape factors.

AB  - For the purposes of testing the impacts of habitat expansion on elephant movement, six XL LoRa elephant radio collars were fixed on three adult male elephants and three adult female elephants prior to a fence being removed at Kariega Game Reserve, South Africa. While none of the collars on female elephants twisted, within five months, all the male elephant collars had twisted, with some triple and double twisting. Behavioural monitoring revealed indications of irritation that resulted in the removal and/or replacement of all twisted collars. It was discovered that two of the male elephants had developed wounds underneath their twisted collars, therefore, only one elephant was re-collared, with a collar that was modified to minimize further risk of twisting, however it twisted again. To investigate this rare incidence of elevated collar twisting, our study assessed the following: elephant behaviour to guide decision-making around interventions and well-being; when, where and how these incidents occurred to investigate the mechanism of twisting and the likelihood of human error; collar design and refurbishment to develop recommendations to minimize the likelihood of twisting; and data obtained from organizations using elephant collars for comparison. From this, it was theorized that browsing behaviour in bulls in dense vegetation, and inadequate collar design were the likely causes in twisting occurrence. We urge organizations using LoRa elephant collars to emphasize post-application monitoring, and exercise caution, when attaching on bulls in dense vegetation. We encourage collar manufacturers to thoroughly investigate twisting incidents and adjust collar structures accordingly and inform clients about the possibility of twisting. By addressing these issues, we can better ensure the well-being of elephants, research success, and improved device safety and efficacy.

AB  - Alcids generally fly at low altitudes (below 5 m) over the sea but may occasionally fly higher in certain areas, which may put them at risk of collision with turbine blades in offshore wind farms. We used GPS loggers to investigate the location and altitude of flying Rhinoceros Auklets Cerorhinca monocerata. They typically flew at low altitudes averaging < 1 m but flew higher (> 20 m) when returning the last 5-10 km to their colony, which was located at an elevation of 120-130 m above sea level. Thus, the region over which Rhinoceros Auklets fly highest may vary, depending on the location and elevation of their breeding sites. Therefore, it is important to consider spatio-temporal flight altitude patterns when assessing their collision risks with offshore wind turbines.

AB  - Many rare plant species lack up-to-date research about their reproductive ecology, which challenges effective in situ and ex situ conservation, particularly in the face of ongoing environmental and anthropogenic changes. For protected species, outdated and incomplete information also creates barriers to successful recovery planning and delisting. In this study, we gathered a range of reproductive metrics for the federally threatened and state endangered Florida endemic mint, Macbridea alba Chapman (Lamiaceae). We collected data at seven populations within Apalachicola National Forest (Florida, USA) and conducted germination trials to estimate reproductive potential. Additionally, we observed a previously undocumented lepidopteran seed predator for the species and confirmed the occurrence of vivipary. The seed set was low with less than 20% of flowers per inflorescence producing seed across populations; however, germination was high with more than 60% of seeds germinating in five of seven populations. When comparing our results to previous research conducted more than 20 years ago, the results were similar overall (i.e., germination, vivipary); however, new information emerged (i.e., herbivore pressure). As M. alba undergoes reassessment as a potential candidate for delisting from the Endangered Species Act (ESA) list, this information is critical for assessing recovery goals and decisions regarding the species' protected status. For recovery needs related to propagation and reintroduction, these results can inform future seed collection and propagation efforts for the species.

AB  - Intensive pig production by and large depends on high quality boarejaculates to accomplish steady fertilization rates. To maximize the breeding process, malesare introduced to the production as soon as possible. Nevertheless, this study suggests thatyoung boars produce spermatozoa with less stable membranes and mitochondrial activitythat are more susceptible to oxidative damage and bacteriospermia. Such predispositionsmay result in low sperm survival following liquid storage which may affect the success ofartificial insemination. Similarly, a decline of sperm quality was observed in senior boars,that is affected by higher cell senescence and susceptibility to DNA damage, and hence to alower ability of the sperm cell to successfully accomplish fertilization. This study strove to investigate the effect of boar age on conventional and non-conventional quality traits of fresh and liquid-stored semen. Sixty boars were allocated into 3 groups: 8-12 months (young); 24-36 months (adult); and 48-60 months (senior). Ejaculates were divided into two parts; the first one was assessed in native state while the second one was extended in the Androstar Plus extender containing gentamycin, stored at 5 degrees C and evaluated following 72 h. Young animals presented with a significantly lower sperm motility (p < 0.01), membrane and acrosome integrity (p < 0.0001), and mitochondrial activity (p < 0.0001) against adult boars. Significantly higher levels of free radicals and tumor necrosis factor alpha (p < 0.001), interleukin 1 and 6 (p < 0.0001) were found in young boars in comparison to adult boars. The assessment of liquid-stored semen revealed a significantly lower sperm motility, membrane, and acrosome integrity (p < 0.0001) in young boars when compared to adult boars. Moreover, Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Rothia nasimurium remained in liquid-stored semen obtained from young boars, while Corynebacterium sp. and Escherichia coli continued to be identified in samples collected from adult boars. In conclusion, age contributes to the overall quality of fresh as well as liquid-stored boar semen.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan parasite capable of infecting possibly all warm-blooded animals including humans, and is one of the most widespread zoonotic pathogens known. Free-ranging wildlife can be valuable sentinels for oocyst contaminated environments, as well as a potential source for human foodborne infection with T. gondii. Here we aimed to determine the sero-prevalence of T. gondii in Danish wild deer pop-ulations and examine risk factors associated with increased exposure to the parasite. Blood samples were collected from 428 cervids (87 fallow deer (Dama dama), 272 red deer (Cervus elaphus), 55 roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and 14 sika deer (Cervus Nippon) from 23 hunting sites in Denmark. The animals were shot during the hunting season 2017/2018, and screened for antibodies against T. gondii using a commercial ELISA kit. One hundred and five (24.5%) cervids were sero-positive. Sero-prevalence was significantly different between species (p < 0.05), with odds of sero-positivity being 4.5 times higher in roe deer than fallow deer, and 3.0 times higher in red deer than in fallow deer. A significant increase in sero-prevalence with age was observed, driven by a significant increase in risk in adult red deer compared to calves (OR: 13.22; 95% CI: 5.96-33.7). The only other significant risk factor associated with wild cervid T. gondii sero-positivity was fencing, with the highest exposure associated with deer from non-fenced hunting areas (OR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.05-4.99). This study documented a widespread exposure to T. gondii in Danish cervids. Therefore the meat of the wild deer, in particular from roe deer and red deer, should be considered a significant risk of T. gondii infections to humans, if not properly cooked. Further, molecular studies to confirm the presence of infective parasitic stages in the muscles of deer used for consumption is recommended.

AB  - Inbreeding threatens the survival of small populations by producing inbreeding depression, but also exposes recessive deleterious effects in homozygosis allowing for genetic purging. Using inbreeding-purging theory, we analyze early survival in four pedigreed captive breeding programs of endangered ungulates where population growth was prioritized so that most adult females were allowed to contribute offspring according to their fitness. We find evidence that purging can substantially reduce inbreeding depression in Gazella cuvieri (with effective population size N-e = 14) and Nanger dama (N-e = 11). No purging is detected in Ammotragus lervia (N-e = 4), in agreement with the notion that drift overcomes purging under fast inbreeding, nor in G. dorcas (N-e = 39) where, due to the larger population size, purging is slower and detection is expected to require more generations. Thus, although smaller populations are always expected to show smaller fitness (as well as less adaptive potential) than larger ones due to higher homozygosis and deleterious fixation, our results show that a substantial fraction of their inbreeding load and inbreeding depression can be purged when breeding contributions are governed by natural selection. Since management strategies intended to maximize the ratio from the effective to the actual population size tend to reduce purging, the search for a compromise between these strategies and purging could be beneficial in the long term. This could be achieved either by allowing some level of random mating and some role of natural selection in determining breeding contributions, or by undertaking reintroductions into the wild at the earliest opportunity.

AB  - Protected areas (PA) to conserve wildlife are the cornerstone of biodiversity conservation but they can also result in increased human-wildlife conflict (HWC), which poses a serious challenge to jointly achieving sustainable development goals of food security and biodiversity conservation, particular in regions with high conservation values and subsistence farmers. In the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan, expanding PAs and other conservation efforts have led to increased wildlife populations that are causing more damage to crop and livestock and impacting on the livelihoods of subsistence farmers and herders. In this study, we used a social-ecological sys-tems framework to quantify the intensity this impact and associated economic losses with identified wildlife species and compared differences between livelihood types (crop farming versus livestock husbandry) and land tenure (inside versus outside protected areas). Results indicated that Meso-scale wildlife species that are not the focus of conservation caused higher economic losses. Approximately 43% of total economic loss through crop depredation was attributed to wild pig (Sus scrofa) and 56% of the total economic loss through livestock pre-dation was caused by wild dogs (Cuon alpinus). Losses borne by respondents whose livelihoods depend mainly on livestock were significantly higher, with a mean loss equivalent to US$1328 per household per annum, than those depending on crop production (US$171 per household per annum). Economic losses incurred through crop and livestock depredation were significantly higher for the respondents residing inside PAs, which is attributed by those households to a perceived increase in wildlife populations because of conservation policies. In-terventions for prevention and mitigation of these impacts should recognize these varying unintended effects of wildlife and be better targeted at groups living in different parts of the landscape. These include expanding compensation scheme to losses caused by wild dogs and pigs, supporting ecotourism ventures within PAs to diversify income options and introducing control measures for these animals.

AB  - Contact among animals is crucial for various ecological processes, including social behaviors, disease transmission, and predator-prey interactions. However, the distribution of contact events across time and space is heterogeneous, influenced by environmental factors and biological purposes. Previous studies have assumed that areas with abundant resources and preferred habitats attract more individuals and, therefore, lead to more contact. To examine the accuracy of this assumption, we used a use-available framework to compare landscape factors influencing the location of contacts between wild pigs (Sus scrofa) in two study areas in Florida and Texas (USA) from those influencing non-contact space use. We employed a contact-resource selection function (RSF) model, where contact locations were defined as used points and locations without contact as available points. By comparing outputs from this contact RSF with a general, population-level RSF, we assessed the factors driving both habitat selection and contact. We found that the landscape predictors (e.g., wetland, linear features, and food resources) played different roles in habitat selection from contact processes for wild pigs in both study areas. This indicated that pigs interacted with their landscapes differently when choosing habitats compared to when they encountered other individuals. Consequently, relying solely on the spatial overlap of individual or population-level RSF models may lead to a misleading understanding of contact-related ecology. Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions about contact and introduce innovative approaches to better understand the ecological drivers of spatially explicit contact. By accurately predicting the spatial distribution of contact events, we can enhance our understanding of contact based ecological processes and their spatial dynamics.

AB  - The rapidly growing global road networks put serious pressures on terrestrial ecosystems and increase the number and severity of human-wildlife conflicts, which in most cases manifest in animal-vehicle collisions (AVCs). AVCs pose serious problems both for biodiversity conservation and traffic safety: each year, millions of vertebrates are roadkilled globally and the related economic damage is also substantial. For a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing AVC it is essential to explore the human factor, that is, the habits and attitude of drivers; however, to date, comprehensive surveys are lacking on this topic. Here we addressed this knowledge gap and surveyed the habits of drivers and their experience and attitude towards AVCs by a comprehensive questionnaire covering a large geographical area and involving a large number of respondents (1942 completed questionnaires). We aimed to reveal how driving habits affect the chance of AVC, and explored the attitude of the drivers regarding AVC. We found that the number of lifetime AVC cases was higher for male drivers, for those who drove longer distances per year, had more driven years, used country roads or drove large vehicles. Our results showed that almost half of the drivers surveyed had experienced at least one AVC in their lifetime. Drivers' attitudes towards the importance of nature conservation or traffic safety in the aspect of AVC, and fear of collision showed a significant correlation with experienced AVC cases. Drivers' opinions indicated that the most trusted and desired AVC prevention measures were physical objects such as fences and wildlife crossings. Our research provides guidelines for developing targeted initiatives in the future to increase awareness about the significance of AVC and target those drivers who are most vulnerable to AVC.

AB  - Simple Summary This study investigated the current conservation status, including the genetic diversity, the family structure, and inbreeding, of the Licha black pig population on Jiaodong Peninsula (Shandong Province, China). The results provide insights into the management and conservation of a local pig breed. Breeders are encouraged to utilize genomic data to improve mating schemes based on the family information obtained in this study, such as keeping an equivalent number of boars and sows in each family and selecting individuals with a kinship coefficient of less than 0.1 for mating. The Licha black pig, a popular indigenous Chinese pig breed, is known for its multi-vertebral trait and higher lean meat rate. Understanding the current conservation status, family structure, and degree of inbreeding of the Licha black pig population will be useful to maintain a sufficient level of genetic diversity in these animal resources. In the present study, the genetic diversity, population structure, and inbreeding coefficient of this conserved population were analyzed using SNP genotyping data from 209 Licha black pigs. Based on the genomic information, this population was divided into eight different families with boars. The effective population size (N-e), polymorphic marker ratio (P-N), expected heterozygosity (H-e), and observed heterozygosity (H-o) of this population were 8.7, 0.827, 0.3576, and 0.3512, respectively. In addition, a total of 5976 runs of homozygosity (ROHs) were identified, and most of the ROHs (54.9%) were greater than 5 Mb. The genomic inbreeding coefficient of each individual was estimated based on ROHs (F-ROH) with an average inbreeding coefficient of 0.11 for the population. Five statistics (N-e, P-N, H-o, H-e, and F-ROH) showed a decrease in the level of genetic diversity and a high degree of inbreeding in this population. Thus, special preservation programs need to be implemented in the future, such as introducing new individuals or improving the mating plan. Altogether, our study provides the first genomic overview of the genetic diversity and population structure of Licha black pigs, which will be useful for the management and long-term preservation of this breed.

KW  - wild boar
AB  - Simple Summary The Danish pig industry, in collaboration with the authorities, has implemented several risk-reducing measures to prevent the introduction of African Swine Fever into Danish pig production. Ongoing risk assessments are conducted to adjust or establish new measures. The first outbreaks in a new area in Northern Europe often occur in wild boar, likely due to discarded food waste at rest areas and in forested areas. A fence has been established on the Danish-German border to limit the migration of wild boar from Germany to Denmark, and the limited population of wild boar in Denmark has been culled. All trucks that transport pigs or cattle are cleaned and disinfected at the border if they have been abroad, according to the DANISH Transportstandard. Through continuous contact with the feed industry, changes in the importation of feedstuffs and other auxiliaries are analyzed, and risk assessments for each feed item are conducted. Based on this, according to the Danish Product Standard, it is not permitted to store or use feed items such as hay, straw, silage, or bedding imported from areas with outbreaks of African Swine Fever on Danish properties with pigs. These types of feed items can contain parts of dead animals in which the virus can survive for a long time. Oil cakes, fats, and oils imported from countries with African Swine Fever may only be used after heat treatment.Abstract African Swine Fever poses a significant threat to pig production. An outbreak in Denmark would have severe economic consequences, potentially resulting in a loss between 335 million and 670 million euros. To mitigate the major risk factors, the Danish authorities and the Danish pig industry have implemented several risk-reducing measures. The small wild boar population in Danish nature has been culled, and a fence between Denmark and Germany has been constructed to stop or reduce the risk of migrating wild boar from Germany. All trucks arriving from abroad, intended for the transport of Danish pigs, are inspected, washed, and disinfected at facilities near the border before being allowed to transport pigs between herds or from herds out of Denmark. Cross-border trade of feedstuffs and potentially risky materials is continuously monitored. Based on risk assessments, feed types or bedding materials from countries with African Swine Fever that could contain parts of wild boar are banned from Danish pig herds. Certain types of fats and oils from countries with African Swine Fever can only be used after heat treatment. The import of whole kernels of corn, wheat, or barley is not considered a risk.

AB  - Extensive home ranges of marine megafauna present a challenge for systematic conservation planning because they exceed spatial scales of conventional management. For elusive species like dugongs, their management is additionally hampered by a paucity of basic distributional information across much of their range. The Red Sea is home to a wide-spread, globally important but data-poor population of dugongs. We surveyed the north-eastern Red Sea in the waters of NEOM, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to locate feeding sites and determine priority areas for dugong conservation. We conducted large-scale in-water surveys of dugong feeding trails across 27 seagrass meadows that span 0.7 degree of latitude and recorded nine seagrass species and 13 dugong feeding sites. Spread over similar to 4,061 km(2) of nearshore and offshore waters, many of these sites clustered around five main core feeding areas. Dugong feeding trails were mostly recorded at sites dominated by the fast-growing pioneer seagrasses Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis and/or H. stipulacea. Multispecific meadows with pioneer seagrasses tended to be sheltered and shallow, reflecting a similar spatial pattern to the identified dugong feeding sites. Often close to hotels and fishing harbours, these high-use dugong areas are subject to high boat traffic, fishing, and coastal development which places considerable pressures on this vulnerable mammal and its seagrass habitat. The rapidly accelerating coastal development in the northern Red Sea directly threatens the future of its dugong population. Although our sampling focuses on feeding signs in early successional seagrasses, the results are valuable to spatial conservation planning as they will trigger overdue conservation interventions for a globally threatened species in a data-poor area. Urgent dugong conservation management actions in the northern Red Sea should focus on shallow waters sheltered by coastal lagoons, bays and the lee of large islands.

AB  - Biological invasions are a great threat to biodiversity. Invasive plants targeted for control with introduced biological control agents are also exposed to indigenous herbivores in the invaded range. The density of native herbivores may affect the interactions between biological control agents and those native herbivores. We conducted a common-garden experiment to examine the interactive effects between a native natural enemy, the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita (Kofold & White), and the leaf beetle Agasicles hygrophila Selma & Vogt, an introduced biological control agent of the invasive alligator weed, Alternantera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb., and its native congener Alternantera sessilis (Linn.) DC. We also manipulated the density of the two herbivores to examine the role of herbivore density in modulating plant-herbivore interactions. We found that (1) the performance of A. hygrophila on A. philoxeroides was inhibited by the nematode regardless of nematode initial density, (2) A. philoxeroides plants subject to herbivory by two beetles had more leaves and fine roots under the high nematode density than those not exposed to nematodes, and (3) the stem diameter of A. philoxeroides subject to herbivory by one beetle was smaller under the moderate nematode density than for plants not exposed to nematodes. However, under the high initial nematode density, both the native and introduced plants had fewer root-knots when co-exposed to herbivory by one beetle than when co-exposed to plants with two beetles. Under the high initial nematode density, A. philoxeroides produced more aboveground biomass but less root biomass than did plants not exposed to nematodes. However, A. sessilis plants exposed to the high initial nematode density produced more root biomass but produced similar aboveground biomass than did plants not exposed to nematodes. These findings suggest that the biological control efficiency of biological control agents may be potentially affected by other herbivores such as nematodes from the soil, and herbivores' densities may determine the nature of the interactive impacts among multiple herbivores on invasive plants.

AB  - Objectives This article presents new radiocarbon and isotopic data to provide further information about the diet of the indigenous population of La Gomera and its possible changes across time.
   Materials and methods delta C-13 and delta N-15 of 53 human and 19 faunal samples from different sites on the island have been obtained and analyzed. Of these, 52 have been radiocarbon dated to provide insight on chronological changes.
   Results Human dates range from the 3rd to 15th centuries AD, while faunal dates range from the 1st to 17th centuries AD. Stable carbon and nitrogen values are significantly different between the human and goat samples and have also a trophic increase of 3.4 parts per thousand. Although male and female delta N-15 data are not significantly different. Both delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of both human and animal samples tend to discretely decrease over time.
   Discussion Radiocarbon dates from humans correlate with other dates obtained in the rest of the archipelago. Animal radiocarbon dates generally coincide except for one date, which requires further study. Isotopic delta N-15 data suggest a mix of marine and terrestrial protein consumption in humans, the latter being more abundant given the seasonality of the first. delta C-13 data also suggest a possible mixed diet in humans, with a predominance of C-3 plants, like Hordeum vulgare, the only grain found in archaeological sites so far. Variations of both delta C-13 and delta N-15 over time suggest a slight modification on the diet, which could be related to environmental changes.

AB  - Modern approaches with advanced technology can automate and expand the extent and resolution of biodiversity monitoring. We present the development of an innovative system for automated wildlife monitoring in a coastal Natura 2000 nature reserve of the Netherlands with 65 wireless 4G wildlife cameras which are deployed autonomously in the field with 12 V/2A solar panels, i.e. without the need to replace batteries or manually retrieve SD cards. The cameras transmit images automatically (through a mobile network) to a sensor portal, which contains a PostgreSQL database and functionalities for automated task scheduling and data management, allowing scientists and site managers via a web interface to view images and remotely monitor sensor performance (e.g. number of uploaded files, battery status and SD card storage of cameras). The camera trap sampling design combines a grid-based sampling stratified by major habitats with the camera placement along a traditional monitoring route, and with an experimental set-up inside and outside large herbivore exclosures. This provides opportunities for studying the distribution, habitat use, activity, phenology, population structure and community composition of wildlife species and allows comparison of traditional with novel monitoring approaches. Images are transferred via application programming interfaces to external services for automated species identification and long-term data storage. A deep learning model for species identification was tested and showed promising results for identifying focal species. Furthermore, a detailed cost analysis revealed that establishment costs of the automated system are higher but the annual operating costs much lower than those for traditional camera trapping, resulting in the automated system being >40 % more cost-efficient. The developed end-to-end data pipeline demonstrates that continuous monitoring with automated wildlife camera networks is feasible and cost-efficient, with multiple benefits for extending the current monitoring methods. The system can be applied in open habitats of other nature reserves with mobile network coverage.

AB  - Philippine native pigs (PhNP) are small black pigs domesticated in rural communities in the Philippines. They are valued locally for their various sociocultural roles. Recently, considerable literature has accumulated in the field of native pig production and marketing. However, there is limited research on the genetic diversity of PhNP. No previous study has investigated the evolutionary relatedness among native pigs from various islands and provinces in Luzon and the Visayas, Philippines. In addition, a much debated question is whether the PhNP were interbreeding with or even domesticated from endemic wild pigs. This study aims to clarify some of the uncertainties surrounding the identity and classification of PhNP based on mito-chondrial DNA (mtDNA) signatures. Native pig samples (n = 157) were collected from 10 provinces in Luzon and the Visayas. Approximately 650 base pairs of the mtDNA D-loop region were sequenced and analyzed together with publicly avail-able sequences. Pairwise-distance analysis showed genetic separation of North and South Luzon (SL) and the clustering of SL with Visayan pigs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the PhNP clustered within 3 recognized Asian pig domestication centers: D2 (East Asia), D7 (Southeast Asia) and the Cordillera clade (sister to the Lanyu). We identified 19 haplotypes (1-38 samples each), forming 4 haplogroups, i.e., North Luzon, South Luzon and Visayas, Asian mix and the Cordillera cluster. No endemic wild pig mtDNA was detected in the native pig population, but evidence of interspecific hybridization was observed. This study showed that the Philippine native pigs have originated from at least 3 Sus scrofa lineage and that they were not domesticated from the endemic wild pigs of the Philippines.

AB  - The local populations of relict plant taxa living near the limits of their geographical range are particularly vulnerable to extinction. For example, Salix lapponum is one of the rarest and most endangered glacial relicts in Western and Central Europe. In Poland, the number of its sites has dramatically decreased over the past few decades, prompting us to take conservation measures focused on saving endangered populations. During a field experiment aimed at the reconstruction of the downy willow population in the Knyszyn Forest (NE Poland), 730 individuals of the species were planted in four different natural sites. The seedlings were obtained by micropropagation from parts of vegetative individuals taken from the most abundant population of this species in eastern Poland (Lake Bikcze). The success of the reintroduction, measured by the number of individuals that survived 2-3 years in the wild and took up growth, was about 67%, however, with low flowering efficiency (7.5%). Additionally, monitoring showed significant differences in plant survival and growth rates under different habitat conditions prevailing at the site and with different cover from competing species, especially tall grasses. However, the restoration projects for relict shrub species should include periodic removal of competing plants and protection of plants from trampling and browsing by herbivorous mammals to increase reintroduction success.

AB  - Populations of Reeves' muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) have become well established in central, southern and eastern England as a result of introduction and colonisation. Although it is widely acknowledged as a species capable of damaging conservation woodland, information on its impacts has often been difficult to unravel because of the presence of other species of deer. In the county of Cambridgeshire, however, it is the most abundant and widespread species, allowing the nature and extent of its impacts to be described in woods where other deer are absent or rare. This article reviews published information and presents new analysis of data. The muntjac has significantly impacted a substantial proportion of conservation woodlands in the county, forming especially high densities in larger woods which are often designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Management by means of fencing and particularly by culling has proved effective in reducing impacts by muntjac in individual woods and in the county as a whole. Timescales of colonisation leading up to causing impacts are also discussed to provide information to assist decision making in other regions or countries where muntjac are currently colonising or may colonise in the future.

AB  - Since its introduction to the Americas in the early 20th century, the wild boar (Sus scrofa) has affected Brazilian ecosystems and may have contributed to the spread of zoonotic diseases, especially rabies. Its interactions with the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) can increase the risk of rabies transmission. These interactions remain poorly documented, particularly in the S & atilde;o Francisco Forest State Park, a conservation unit in the north of Paran & aacute;. In this study, we used camera traps to record three interactions between D. rotundus and S. scrofa, revealing a potential new route for zoonotic spread. Urbanization expansion and forest fragmentation further raise the risk of rabies transmission to animals and humans. Our findings highlight the need for policies and strategies to control wild boar populations and monitor vampire bats to protect public and environmental health in the region.

AB  - Palms, like all plants, show coevolutionary relationships with animals that have been traditionally categorized as mutualistic (seed dispersers and pollinators) or antagonistic (seed predators). This dual perspective, however, has prevented a full understanding of their true interactions with some animal groups, mainly those that do not ingest entire fruits. One clear example is parrots, which have been described to use palm species as feeding resources, while their role as seed dispersers has been largely neglected. Here, we combined fieldwork data with information from the literature and citizen science (i.e., naturalists and nature photographers) on parrot foraging ecology worldwide to evaluate the spatial and taxonomic extent of parrot-palm interactions and to identify the eco-evolutionary factors involved. We identified 1,189 interactions between 135 parrots and 107 palm species in more than 50 countries across the six realms where palms are present as natives or introduced. Combining this information, we identified 427 unique parrot-palm interacting pairs (i.e., a parrot species interacting with a palm species). Pure antagonistic interactions (i.e., parrots just preying on seeds or eating or destroying their non-reproductive parts) were less common (5%) than mutualistic ones (i.e., parrots benefiting by partially preying on the seed or fruit or consuming the pulp of the fruit or the flower but also contributing to seed dispersal and, potentially, pollination; 89%). After controlling for phylogeny, the size of consumed seeds and parrot body mass were positively related. Seed dispersal distances varied among palm species (range of estimated median dispersal distances: 9-250 m), with larger parrots dispersing seeds at greater distances, especially large fruits commonly categorized as megafauna anachronisms (>4 cm length). Although parrot-palm interactions are widespread, several factors (e.g., social behavior, predation fear, food availability, or seasonality) may affect the actual position of parrots on the antagonism-mutualism continuum for different palm species and regions, deserving further research. Meanwhile, the pervasiveness of parrot-palm mutualistic interactions, mainly involving seed dispersal and pollination, should not be overlooked in studies of palm ecology and evolution.

AB  - Achieving the UN SD Goals requires the conservation of keystone marine species. As top predators, many sharks play a crucial role in balancing marine ecosystems; yet, they have been experiencing severe population declines. Overfishing is indisputably the main threat to shark populations, but little is known about the impact of nonextractive human pressure. This study tests the effect of varied human presence on shark behavior at an insular marine reserve. In 2020, humans were virtually absent from Fernando de Noronha (FEN), Brazil, during a 211-days lockdown period prompted by the COVID-19 pandemics. A local shark tracking program rendered nearly 280000 acoustic detections in coastal waters from 2016 through 2021. Lemon sharks, Negaprion brevirostris, showed a 43% increase in detection rate during the lockdown which was ascribed to the concomitant decrease in human presence. In contrast, the detection rate of tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, decreased by 67% during the lockdown, but this trend was likely related to seasonality in tiger shark behavior. After the lockdown, both species' detection rates tended to return to previous levels. Further, lemon sharks increased diurnal coastal residency and made more use of areas less restrictive to human use during the lockdown, whilst tiger sharks increased nocturnal coastal residency during and after the lockdown period. Contrasting trends might relate with lemon sharks completing their life cycle in FEN and tiger sharks being migrants arriving to FEN at older ages and being less exposed to local anthropogenic stimuli across ontogeny. This study demonstrates that non-extractive human disturbance can induce significant changes in the way marine predators explore crucial habitats for accomplishing trophic, reproductive, and ontogenetic functions. Ascertaining the ecological impacts of marinebased human development should thus consider cryptic responses by keystone megafauna to the anthropogenic landscape produced by an ever-growing coastal population. The designation of human exclusion marine areas could emerge as the single solution to endow shark populations with suitable habitats for optimizing their resilience to human pressure.

AB  - For contributing to a better understanding of the phylogenetic position and evolutionary history of Turkish roe deer, mitochondrial DNA sequence data belonging to a population from Artvin, Turkey were introduced by this study. The cytochrome b (cyt b) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) genes of mitochondrial DNA belonging to the four samples of Capreolus capreolus were partially sequenced and analyzed alongside the sequences obtained from GenBank. The cyt b and COI data sets included sequences that were 1059 and 646 bp long, respectively. The Turkish roe deer population in Artvin had a relatively low nucleotide diversity and high haplotype diversity. A total of two haplotypes were identified for cyt b, while three haplotypes were identified for COI. Of the haplotypes detected, two cyt b and two COI haplotypes were specific to Turkey. Molecular phylogenetic analyses; Maximum Likelihood (ML), Bayesian Inference (BI), and Network revealed topologies and evolutionary networks which were not definitely resolved. Consequently, Turkish roe deer haplotypes were intertwined with the roe deer haplotypes from Central Europe instead of forming an independent evolutionary clade, and were also, found genetically close to Central European haplotypes. According to the evolutionary dating analysis, the divergence of C. capreolus populations in Europe started at the beginning of the Pleistocene (approximately 2.72 mya). This analysis also demonstrated that the divergence of Turkish roe deer began at approximately 0.58 mya. Given the existence of, shared haplotypes, the relative positions of Turkish roe deer haplotypes in the topologies of the ML and BI phylogenetic trees and evolutionary networks, and the times of evolutionary divergence events within this species; the following results may be inferred: (1) roe deer individuals with the same genotype as those in Europe can also be found in areas further east, such as Turkey; (2) these could be considered to be representatives, which may have contributed to the formation and shaping processes of the known admixed genetic structure of European roe deer populations in Europe; and finally, (3) the roe deer populations may have probably entered Turkey from Europe when evolutionary divergence times based on BI analysis are considered.

AB  - Intensive commercial production of burbot fingerlings will depend on consistent supply of eggs and larvae at multiple times during the year; however, no information on out-of-season spawning of burbot exists. The current study was designed to shift sexual maturation of burbot broodstock by six months from the natural spawning season through temperature and photoperiod manipulation. Results demonstrated that out-of-season spawning of burbot was successful. Broodstock, egg quality, and larval condition data were compared between out-of-season and in-season groups. For both production regimes, broodstock were sampled for condition factor and egg production, and embryos were monitored for development, viability, and survival. Larvae were reared to 35 days post hatch (dph) for growth and survival comparison. There was no significant difference in pre-spawn condition factor between in-season and out-of-season males or females. Post-spawn condition factor for out-of-season females was not statistically different from in-season females, 0.83 (+/- 0.06) and 0.66 (+/- 0.07) respectively. However, post-spawn condition factor for out-of-season male broodstock was significantly higher, 0.82 (+/- 0.04), than in-season fish, 0.64 (+/- 0.02). Eggs produced relative to weight of pre-spawn female did not differ significantly between in-season and out-of-season production, 328.5 (+/- 22.95) and 213 (+/- 38.04) eggs/g, respectively. Fertilization did not differ significantly between treatments, averaging 90% for both in and out-of-season production. Egg survival was higher, 61.18% (+/- 9.3), in the final week of incubation for out-of-season groups compare to eggs from in-season broodstock, 20.59% (+/- 10.6). However, no difference in larval growth or survival was observed out to the 35dph termination point. Overall, egg quality and larval survival was not negatively impacted for broodstock spawned out-of-season. This is the first report demonstrating that burbot eggs can be produced outside the natural spawning season by altering photoperiod and temperature. As commercial production of this species develops, this will be an important tool to mitigate the risk of relying on a single annual spawning season and can ensure a consistent supply of burbot fingerlings throughout the year.

AB  - Simple Summary Small ruminant lentiviruses are a group of viruses characterized by a high genetic and antigenic variability. In the absence of control measures, they are characterized by high prevalence in goat and sheep farms. In Greece, a country characterized by one of the highest small ruminant populations in Europe, SRLVs are well-known pathogens, but so far, few studies have investigated the circulating viral strains and their prevalence in the islands and mainland. The results of this research highlighted the presence of both A and B subtypes as well as the predominance of a novel A viral cluster. In many cases, the combined serological-molecular approach allowed us to identify more than one viral subtype in a single farm.Abstract Small ruminant lentiviruses are a group of viruses infecting goat and sheep worldwide. These viruses exhibit an extraordinary degree of genetic and antigenic variability that severely influence in vivo and in vitro features, as well as diagnostic test results. Small ruminant farming is the most important animal farming business in Greece, with a high impact on the Greek primary economy. Although SRLV infection and its impact on animal production are well established in the country, little is known about the circulating SRLV strains and their prevalence. The aim of this study was to characterize SRLVs circulating in Greece with a combined serological and molecular approach, using the bulk milk matrix collected from 60 farms in different municipalities. This study allowed us to estimate a seroprevalence of around 52% at the herd level. The B1, B2 and A3 subtypes and a novel A viral cluster were identified. Moreover, the amplicon sequencing method allowed us to identify more than one viral subtype in a sample. These results again confirm the high variability of these viruses and highlight the importance of the constant monitoring of viral evolution, in particular in antigens of diagnostic interest.

AB  - The pervasive use of plastic in modern society has led to plastic litter becoming ubiquitous within the ocean. Land-based sources of plastic litter are thought to account for the majority of plastic pollution in the marine environment, with plastic bags, bottles, wrappers, food containers and cutlery among the most common items found. In the marine environment, plastic is a transboundary pollutant, with the potential to cause damage far beyond the political borders from where it originated, making the management of this global pollutant particularly complex. In this study, the risks of land-derived plastic litter (LDPL) to major groups of marine megafauna - seabirds, cetaceans, pinnipeds, elasmobranchs, turtles, sirenians, tuna and billfish - and a selection of productive and biodiverse biogenic habitats - coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass, saltmarsh and kelp beds - were analysed using a Spatial Risk Assessment approach. The approach combines metrics for vulnerability (mechanism of harm for megafauna group or habitat), hazard (plastic abundance) and exposure (distribution of group or habitat). Several potential high-risk zones (HRZs) across the North Atlantic were highlighted, including the Azores, the UK, the French and US Atlantic coasts, and the US Gulf of Mexico. Whilst much of the modelled LDPL driving risk in the UK originated from domestic sources, in other HRZs, such as the Azores archipelago and the US Gulf of Mexico, plastic originated almost exclusively from external (non -domestic) sources. LDPL from Caribbean islands - some of the largest generators of marine plastic pollution in the dataset of river plastic emissions used in the study - was noted as a significant input to HRZs across both sides of the Atlantic. These findings highlight the potential of Spatial Risk Assessment analyses to determine the location of HRZs and understand where plastic debris monitoring and management should be prioritised, enabling more efficient deployment of interventions and mitigation measures.

AB  - Parasites constitute a significant economic burden and highly impact environmental, public, and animal health. The emergence of many parasitic diseases is environmentally mediated and they share the same biogeography with humans and both domestic and wild animals. American liver fluke, Fascioloides magna - a trematode parasite of domestic and wild ungulates - is an example of the anthropogenic introduction of an "invasive alien species" in Italy and Europe. Multiple introductions to Europe have led to the biogeographical expansion of the parasite across the Danube region mainly provided by the presence of suitable habitats for all hosts involved in the parasite's life cycle, human-assisted transport, and drastic environmental events such as flooding. In Italy, it was introduced and established in La Mandria Regional Park (LMRP) near Turin in 1865 along with imported wapitis (Cervus elaphus canadensis) from North America (Bassi, 1875), but with no reported expansion to the surrounding areas. LMRP isolated F. magna focus, poses an important threat of possible expansion since the enclosed area is vulnerable to occasional bidirectional passage of roe deer. Additionally, tributary rivers to the Po river system, traversing the enclosed area, could further bolster the possibility of such spread. In this study, we developed a duplex qPCR assay for F. magna and its principal intermediate host Galba truncatula optimized for testing eDNA samples to meet the needs for surveillance of the parasite. Moreover, we validated the developed assay in natura by testing samples derived from filtered water and sediments collected inside and outside LMRP's fenced -off area. Our findings for the first time demonstrate the presence of F. magna's eDNA outside the park's internal fenced -off area.

AB  - While the conservation of forest elephants is a global concern, human-elephant conflict (HEC), especially crop-raiding by elephants, is a serious threat to both human livelihoods and conservation efforts. However, only a few studies have explored elephant crop-raiding and related damage mitigation strategies in Central Africa's forest landscapes, which are characterized by low human and high animal densities and shifting cultivation practices. This study investigates HEC in rural Gabon, where human activities are limited, and local livelihoods are severely threatened by crop-raiding elephants. Through long-term ethnographic research and an in-depth analysis of damage mitigation practices by local people, the study unveils serious crop-raiding by elephants, leading to a significant change in the local lifestyle. Most households spend the majority of days in the field protecting crops, resulting in the village becoming almost empty. In addition to the physical burden of staying in poor living conditions, there is a considerable psychological burden for local people. Establishing effective elephant conservation systems requires understanding each local situation and evaluating the various costs to local people. To sustain livelihoods and address the challenge of HEC, it is crucial for local communities and various stakeholders to act collectively.

AB  - Soil water storage properties, which are affected by land management practices, alter the water balance and flow regimes in watersheds; thus, it is highly plausible to clarify the influence of such management practices on the water storage condition by analyzing the long-term variations in discharge. In this study, the changes in soil water storage characteristics of the Ogouchi Dam watershed, which had undergone intensive forest management through the decades, were investigated using two approaches. Reported results from the rainfall-runoff correlation analysis show a gradual and steady increase in the soil water storage capacity at weaker continuous-rainfall events, i.e., uninterrupted wet days accumulating less than 70 mm. Meanwhile, the second approach utilizing the parameter calibration in the SWAT discharge model illustrated a constant trend in the runoff potential and the high possibility of a steady improvement in the soil available water capacity. Overall, the established decadal trends were able to prove the capability of sustainable forest management, i.e., thinning, regeneration cutting, multi-layer planting, deer-prevention fences, and earth-retaining fences (lined felled trees), in improving the water conservation function of the catchment.

AB  - In long-lived species, although adult survival typically has the highest elasticity, temporal variations in less canalized demographic parameters are the main drivers of population dynamics. Targeting recruitment rates may thus be the most effective strategy to manage these species. We analyzed 1,136 capture-recapture histories collected over 9 years in an isolated population of the critically endangered Lesser Antillean iguana, using a robust design Pradel model to estimate adult survival and recruitment rates. From an adult population size estimated at 928 in 2013, we found a yearly decline of 4% over the 8-year period. As expected under the canalization hypothesis for a long-lived species, adult survival was high and constant, with little possibility for improvement, whereas the recruitment rate varied over time and likely drove the observed population decline. We then used a prospective perturbation analysis to explore whether managing the species' immature cohorts would at least slow the population decline. The prospective perturbation analysis suggested that a significant and sustained conservation effort would be needed to achieve a recruitment rate high enough to slow the population decline. We posit that the high recruitment rate achieved in 2014-likely due to the maintenance in 2012 of the main nesting sites used by this population-would be sufficient to slow this population's decline if it was sustained each year. Based on the results of diverse pilot studies we conducted, we identified the most likely threats targeting the eggs and immature cohorts, stressing the need to improve reproductive success and survival of immature iguanas. The threats we identified are also involved in the decline of several reptile species, and species from other taxa such as ground-nesting birds. These findings on a little-studied taxon provide further evidence that focusing on the immature life stages of long-lived species can be key to their conservation.

AB  - In this update paper, we present the latest developments in the OMA browser knowledgebase, which aims to provide high-quality orthology inferences and facilitate the study of gene families, genomes and their evolution. First, we discuss the addition of new species in the database, particularly an expanded representation of prokaryotic species. The OMA browser now offers Ancestral Genome pages and an Ancestral Gene Order viewer, allowing users to explore the evolutionary history and gene content of ancestral genomes. We also introduce a revamped Local Synteny Viewer to compare genomic neighborhoods across both extant and ancestral genomes. Hierarchical Orthologous Groups (HOGs) are now annotated with Gene Ontology annotations, and users can easily perform extant or ancestral GO enrichments. Finally, we recap new tools in the OMA Ecosystem, including OMAmer for proteome mapping, OMArk for proteome quality assessment, OMAMO for model organism selection and Read2Tree for phylogenetic species tree construction from reads. These new features provide exciting opportunities for orthology analysis and comparative genomics. OMA is accessible at https://omabrowser.org.

AB  - A wide range of ant-plant mutualistic associations are known to occur in terrestrial ecosystems. Although many species of plants recruit ants to obtain protection from herbivores, myrmecophily is rare, since only few plant species are known to be adapted for pollination predominantly by ants. The annual herb, Euphorbia hirta, is characterized by the 'ant-pollination syndrome' including traits such as unisexual flowers, inconspicuous cyathia clustered in globose cymes, inflorescence-associated tiny nectaries and short, semi-erect stem. In present study, we aimed to examine the pollination ecology of Euphorbia hirta and the role of ants in its pollination. Field and laboratory experiments conducted to understand the association between E. hirta plants and ants revealed that seven ant species (belonging to five genera and three subfamilies) visited E. hirta plants. The visitation patterns of ants revealed that in a single foraging trip the ants visited a number of plants indicating their potential role in cross-pollination. Field-based exclusion experiments revealed production of significantly higher number of fruits in E. hirta plants under open pollination treatment as compared to other treatments. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the adherence of the pollen grains to the bristles located on ant mouth-parts was facilitated by the three vertical, semi-circular grooves present on the grain surface. The number of fruits produced per plant was higher in ant-included plants as compared to only winged insect-pollinated and only self-pollinated plants suggesting that the plant-visiting ants are successful pollination vectors of E. hirta and while promoting self-pollination also contribute towards cross-pollination services.

AB  - Dama gazelles (Nanger dama Pallas, 1766) are critically endangered within their native habitat of northern Africa's Sahelo-Saharan Zone. However, several Texas ranches maintain populations that provide a hedge against extinction and that can provide suitable stock for conservation projects, including reintroduction. For these initiatives, there is a critical need for information on spatial requirements of male dama gazelles. This is especially the case, because population increase is hindered by aggressive behaviour of males kept within limited areas. Adult males kill other males. We report on the spatial distribution and interaction potential (interanimal distances) of male eastern dama gazelles (N. dama ruficollis) from a population living on 8 996 ha of fenced rangeland in West Texas, USA. We fitted five males with GPS-radio collars and tracked their positions every 3 h for one year. Adult males (n = 3) maintained annual 95% Kernel Home Ranges (KHR) averaging 1 783 ha with 50% core areas averaging 440 ha. Average distance between adults with adjacent home ranges was 2.8 to 4.6 km, with only four contacts within 20 m recorded. Subadult males (n = 2) had more diffuse home ranges and a common core area. They only associated in a loose bachelor group for part of the time. Their space use can overlap with that of adult males. When spatial requirements are met, problems caused by aggression can be minimised. Small sample size prevents definite recommendations, but results point to productive avenues for additional study to enhance management of other ex situ populations.

AB  - Attacks by large predators on livestock are an important driver of conflicts. Consequently, knowledge about where predators occur, where livestock depredation takes place and what factors influence it will aid the mitigation of stakeholder conflicts. Following legal protection, wolves (Canis lupus) in Central Europe are recently spreading to areas dominated by agriculture, bringing them in closer contact with livestock. Here, we analyzed habitat selection and livestock depredation rates of 43 wolves identified by genotyping on the Jutland peninsula, consisting of mainland Denmark and the northernmost German federal state Schleswig-Holstein. Occupancy by resident wolves correlated positively with forest and other non-forested semi-natural land cover (habitat for natural ungulate prey), whereas occupancy by non-resident wolves correlated with increasing forest cover and sheep density. The latter effect likely reflected increased sampling probability of highly mobile dispersers killing livestock. We recorded 565 livestock depredation events (85 in Denmark and 480 in Schleswig-Holstein), of which 42% (55 in DK and 185 in SH) could be assigned to 27 individual wolves based on DNA evidence. Livestock (mostly sheep) were killed by wolves in 16% of the study area. Our results indicate that wolves mostly killed livestock as a context-dependent response, i.e., being dispersers in agricultural areas with low availability of wild ungulate prey and high livestock densities, and not because of behavioral preferences for sheep. Moreover, the livestock depredation was lower in areas with livestock protection measures (implemented in areas with established pairs/packs). We conclude that while wolf attacks on livestock in established wolf territories generally can be reduced through improvement of fences, livestock depredation by non-resident wolves in agricultural areas constitutes a bigger challenge. Albeit technically possible, the economic costs of implementing predator-proof fences and other preventive measures in such pastoral areas infrequently visited by wolves will be considerable. Experiences so far further indicate that lethal removal of identified "problem wolves" may be inefficient in practice.

AB  - In this study, we aimed to identify genetic variants of the TLR5 gene and the promoter methylation level with a susceptibility to brucellosis in Chinese Saanen dairy goats ( SN). We randomly collected 205 genetically unrelated animals from five Chinese goat breeds, including the Saanen dairy goat (SN, n = 67), Tibetan goat ( TG, n = 35), Chuannan black goat (CN, n = 30), Meigu goat ( MG, n = 37) and the Jianzhou big-ear goat (JZ, n = 36). A blood sample was collected from each individual and used for the detection of brucellosis, TLR5 polymorphism identification and the detection of promoter methylation. In total, twenty-four SNPs were identified in the five investigated breeds. The allele and genotype frequency of the four loci (g.435C>T, g.690G>T, g. 978A>G and g.1832A>G) were correlated with a seroprevalence of brucellosis in the SN goats. An r2 linkage disequilibrium ( LD) was detected in SN, CN, TG and MG, but not in the JZ goats. Ten methylation sites were detected on the first CpG island with DNA methylation levels ranging from 0.2% to 5.2%, and twenty- two methylation sites were found on the second methylation island with a 2.3% to 12.1% methylation. The methylation levels of the two CpG islands in the healthy SN were significantly higher than those recorded in the brucella-infected SN (p <0.05). Our findings demonstrated that genetic variations and the promoter methylation of TLR5 were associated with a brucellosis risk in SN goats. These results will be helpful for further studies of disease resistance in ruminants.

AB  - Growth hormone is the major gene playing regulatory role in growth and metabolism of vertebrates. Several reports have identified mutations in GH gene that are associated with animal productivity. The bovine GH has been studied quite thoroughly but very little information regarding Buffalo growth hormone is available in literature. Buffalo is an important source of milk in Asia and there is a need to identify variations in the genes of buffalo GH and its possible effects in milk production. The present research was carried out to explore DNA polymorphism in buffalo growth hormone gene. In this study we amplified a 5' flanking region covering exon 1 from local specie of Bubalus bubalis. As the 5' region of the GH is very important in controlling the expression of the gene and minor changes in this sequence can affect its expression in blood. The PCR amplicon was sequenced and analyzed for homology with the help of BLAST search. Surprisingly, along with various point mutations in this region, we found that a considerable base sequence upstream exon 1 was similar to Bos mutus (yakQH1 chromosome 19) and did not align with reported Bubalus bubalis GH sequence. Only 49% of the sequenced product aligns with Bubalus Bubalis though 90% of the sequence aligns with Bos mutus and Bos indicus GH gene. A 46 bp inverted repeat sequence was also identified upstream exon 1. This report not only raises questions about the purity of the gene but also indicates mutations which may affect animal productivity like milk yield, growth regulation and carcass composition. There is a need to report these mutations so that their effects can be studied further. The complete animal history, means of semen supply or the methods used for its introduction can give clues about these findings.

AB  - Marine oxygen minimum zones play a crucial role in the global oceanic carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles as they harbor microbial communities that are adapted to the water column chemistry and redox zonation, and in turn control the water column chemistry and greenhouse gas release. These micro-organisms have metabolisms that rely on terminal electron acceptors other than O-2 and often benefit from syntrophic relationships (metabolic coupling). Here, we study chemo(auto)trophy along the redoxcline in two stratified fjords on Vancouver Island (Canada) using bacterial bacteriohopanepolyols and archaeal ether lipids. We analyze the distribution of these lipid classes in suspended particulate matter (SPM) to trace ammonia oxidation, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), sulfate reduction/sulfur oxidation, methanogenesis, and methane oxidation, and investigate ecological niches to evaluate potential links between their respective bacterial and archaeal sources. Our results show an unparalleled BHP and ether lipid structural diversity that allows tracing the major redox-driven metabolic processes at the time of sampling: Both fjords are dominated by archaeal ammonia oxidation and anammox; sulfate-reducing bacteria may be present in Deer Bay, but absent from Effingham Inlet; methanogenic Euryarchaeota and archaeal and bacterial methanotrophs are detectable at low abundance. Correlation analysis reveals distinct biomarker clusters that provide constraints on the biogeochemical niches of some orphan BHP and ether lipids such as in situ-produced adenosyl-BHPs or unsaturated archaeols.

AB  - Between 1925 and 1930, 11 or 12 non-native mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) were translocated from Alaska and British Columbia to the foothills of the Olympic Range. By 1970, descendants of these goats had colonized the entire range and concerns about the management of this introduced species developed as damage to alpine soil and vegetation occurred. A series of removals reduced the population from 1175 in 1983 to 389 by 1990, eventually growing to 584 in 2016. We used demographic and genetic data to parameterize a population genetics individual-based simulation model of the Olympic Range mountain goats. We calibrated the model to replicate the population trajectory for Olympic mountain goats from establishment in the 1920s through the 1983 first census. As expected, modeled population dynamics from 1928 to 1983 mimicked parameter initialization from expanding populations. However, simulated heterozygosity did not align with observations, suggesting a process not accounted for within the simulation model, such as a bottleneck or founder effect. Sensitivity analyses showed changes in annual reproductive rate, juvenile mortality, and adult female mortality influencing population trajectories, but variation in male mortality revealed no changes. Evaluating the population dynamics of the model after removals showed that approximately 80% of the total animals removed during the 1980s needed to be female in order for the observed population estimates to occur. This model has the potential to be used more widely with established or introduced mountain goat populations, as well as to provide an approach for studying other introduced species and their population dynamics.

AB  - Human-mediated species dispersal across the Mediterranean stretches back at least 10,000 years and has left an indelible stamp on present-day biodiversity. Believed to be a descendant of the Asiatic mouflon (Ovis gmelini gmelinii), the Corsican mouflon (O. g. musimon) was translocated during the Neolithic as ancestral livestock by humans migrating from the Fertile Crescent to the Western Mediterranean. Today, two geographically limited and disconnected populations can be found in Corsica. Whether they originated from distinct founders or one ancestral population that later split remains unknown, although such information is pivotal for the species' management on the island. We genotyped 109 and 176 individuals at the Cytochrome-b gene and 16 loci of the microsatellite DNA, respectively, to gain insights into the natural history of the Corsican mouflon. We found evidence confirming that the Asiatic was the ancestor of the Corsican mouflon, which should thus be unvaryingly referred to as O. g. musimon, i.e. as a subspecies of the Asiatic mouflon. Haplotype divergence dating and the investigation of genetic structure highlighted a strong and ancient genetic differentiation between the two Corsican populations. Approximate Bayesian Computation pointed to the introduction of a single group of founders as the most reliable scenario for the origin of the entire Corsican population. Later, this ancestral stock would have decreased in number, facing genetic bottlenecks and eventually resulting in two divergent demes. Splitting most likely occurred several hundred years ago. Their shared past notwithstanding, we discuss whether the two relic Corsican mouflon populations should be now considered as distinct management units.

AB  - Simple Summary Captive breeding is important for ex-situ conservation and future reintroduction. This research aims to conduct a population viability analysis (PVA) for a sustainable reintroduction program for bantengs. The monthly development of 23 founder individuals was assessed. The PVA showed that the time required to reach the maximum population in a captive banteng program is dependent on the carrying capacity of the habitat. The reduction of a small banteng founder group by the reintroduction of animals into the wild can negatively affect the population growth of the captive group. This information can be used to maintain the population viability of bantengs and sustain ex-situ conservation and the reintroduction program in Thailand and elsewhere. Captive breeding is important for ex-situ conservation and the future reintroduction of bovids that become extinct in the wild. The age structure, development, and viability of captive-bred bantengs (Bos javanicus) are important to sustain the long-term reintroduction program in Salakphra Wildlife Sanctuary (SWF) and other areas. This research conducted a long-term population viability analysis (PVA) using height, weight, body condition scores (BSC), age structure, and development in captivity for a sustainable reintroduction program of bantengs in Thailand. Monthly development photographs of 23 founder individuals (12 males and 11 females) were assessed by three banteng experts, two researchers, and three members of the general public. The assessments of weight and BCS were not significantly different among the three groups, while height was underestimated by the general public. The PVA showed that the time to reach the maximum population in a captive banteng program is dependent on the carrying capacity of the habitat. The reduction of a small banteng founder group by the reintroduction of animals into the wild can negatively affect the population growth of the captive group. This information can be used to maintain the population viability of bantengs and sustain ex-situ conservation and the reintroduction program in Thailand and elsewhere.

AB  - Bats are known to occur all over the world except in the Arctic and Antarctic regions and a few isolated oceanic islands. Bats have been on Earth for more than 50 million years. Currently, there are more than 1,400 species on the globe. They are the second-largest order of mammals and are widely dispersed across six continents. According to the South Asian Chiroptera Conservation Assessment and Management Plan Workshop report, India has 114 species of bats of which 13 species are under the suborder Megachiroptera. The species Latidens salimalii (Salim Ali' s fruit bat) found in Madurai district of Tamil Nadu and Otomops wroughtonii (Wroughton' s free-tailed bat) found in Belgaum of Karnataka are the two only Indian bat species that are listed on Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act of India, 1972 amended up-to-date. Bats or chiropteran studies at Assam along with other northeast Indian counterparts are very meager and there is no continuous study data from any places of Assam. Besides some detailed studies on the Indian flying fox (Pteropus giganteus giganteus) most of the other studies are based on opportunistic random catches. On the basis of the available research publications of a few bat researchers of Assam, it can become to the conclusion that currently, Assam's counterpart of Northeast India has about a total of 39 different bat species under 16 genera. Out of those 39 species, five species are recorded as Megachiropteran species (fruit bats) along with 34 numbers of Microchiropteran species. Most of the microchiropteran species are insectivorous in nature with a few being carnivorous. All the recorded species of the Suborder-Megachiroptera were found to be included under a single family called Pteropodidae. However, microchiroptera species recorded from Assam were found to be spread into five different families such as Emballonuridae, Megadermatidae, Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, and Vespertilionidae. The highest numbers of species were recorded under the family Vespertilionidae which is commonly known as "Evening bats". To date, 19 species are recorded under this family followed by Rhinolophidae with six species. The rest of the recorded families shared 2-4 species.

AB  - The rise of angiosperms to ecological dominance and the breakup of Gondwana during the Mesozoic marked major transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions. To elucidate how contemporary trophic interactions were influenced by host plant shifts and palaeogeographical events, we integrated molecular data with information from the fossil record to construct a time tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the beetle family Belidae. Our analyses indicate that crown-group Belidae originated approximately 138 Ma ago in Gondwana, associated with Pinopsida (conifer) host plants, with larvae likely developing in dead/decaying branches. Belids tracked their host plants as major plate movements occurred during Gondwana's breakup, surviving on distant, disjunct landmasses. Some belids shifted to Angiospermae and Cycadopsida when and where conifers declined, evolving new trophic interactions, including brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous parasitic angiosperms. Extant radiations of belids in the genera Rhinotia (Australian region) and Proterhinus (Hawaiian Islands) have relatively recent origins.conifer hosts on the newly formed land masses. However, when conifers became less common, some of the beetles switched to feeding and developing larvae on flowering plants instead, diversifying again.Understanding how changes in the availability of plants and the Earth's geography have affected insects in the past can help scientists understand evolutionary history as well as current ecosystem stability and biodiversity. With further research, this may help scientists to devise strategies to better manage and preserve ecosystems.

AB  - Resource competition is an important interaction that can structure ecological communities, but is difficult to demonstrate in nature, and rarely demonstrated for large mammals including marsupials. We analysed 10 years of population survey data to investigate resource competition between bare-nosed wombats (Vombatus ursinus) and eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) at two sites to assess whether resource competition is occurring. At one site, wombat abundance was reduced by increased mortality from mange disease, whereas at the other site, kangaroo abundance was reduced primarily by culling. We used the modified Lotka-Volterra competition (LVC) models to describe the mechanism of resource competition and fitted those models to the empirical data by maximum likelihood estimation. We found strong negative relationships between the abundance of wombats and kangaroos at each site, and resource competition was also mechanistically supported by the modified LVC models. The estimated competition coefficients indicate that bare-nosed wombats are a slightly superior competitor of eastern grey kangaroos than vice versa, and that intraspecific competition is almost twice as strong as interspecific competition. In addition, this study facilitated the calculation of the transmission rate associated with mange disease at one site (0.011), and the removal rate owing to culling, the introduction of a predator species, and drought at the other site (0.0006). Collectively, this research represents a rare empirical demonstration of resource competition between large mammals and contributes new insight into the ecology of two of Australia's largest grazing marsupials.

AB  - We defined the reference intervals for blood parameters of giant pandas. This is the first study to reveal changes in blood parameters in giant pandas in response to changes in elevation. These data help us to plan reintroduction of captive born giant pandas.
   Physiological indexes like blood parameters have been widely used to monitor the health of free-roaming animals. Attempts to reintroduce one of China's most endangered species, the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), have been hampered by a lack of data on its ecology and physiology. We examined three giant pandas' hematological and blood chemistry parameters in a soft release program and 30 captive giant pandas as controls and determined the reference intervals (RIs) for those blood parameters in the captive animals. Elevation, captivity status and the interaction of those factors were statistically significant for hematologic measures. Release pandas had significantly higher hemoglobin and hematocrit values after they moved to high elevation locations. We also found significant difference in the enzyme parameters between high and low elevation pandas such as higher aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine kinase, amylase and lower lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase. Release pandas also had higher nutrition parameter values such as higher albumin, globulin and creatinine. The RI for blood parameters in our study provides a baseline to monitor the health of captive animals and forms the basis for assessing the health of free-roaming giant pandas in future reintroduction efforts.

AB  - Since 2007, an ongoing African swine fever (ASF) pandemic has significantly impacted Eurasia. Extensive field evidence and modeling confirm the central role of wild boar in ASF epidemiology. To effectively control and eradicate the infection, rapid detection of the ASF virus (ASFV) is crucial for prompt intervention in areas of recent viral introduction or ongoing outbreaks. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a cost-effective and non-invasive technique that has shown promising results in monitoring animal species and their pathogens and has the potential to be used for wildlife disease surveillance. In this study, we designed and evaluated an eDNA sampling method for highly turbid water and soil samples to detect ASFV and wild boar (Sus scrofa) DNA as a control using qPCR while ensuring biosafety measures and evaluating ASF epidemiology. To validate our method, we obtained samples from La Mandria Regional Park (LMRP) in northwestern Italy, an area free of ASFV, and spiked them in a laboratory setting with an ASFV's synthetic DNA template. Our findings highlight the potential of eDNA monitoring as a reliable, rapid, and safe method for early detection of ASFV from soil and turbid water samples.

AB  - The ability to locate essential resources is a critical step for wildlife translocated into novel environments. Understanding this process of exploration is highly desirable for management that seeks to resettle wildlife, particularly as translocation projects tend to be expensive and have a high potential for failure. African savannah elephants (Loxodonta africana) are very mobile and rely on large areas especially in arid environments, and are translocated for differing management and conservation objectives. Thus, research into how translocated elephants use the landscape when released may both guide elephant managers and be useful for translocations of other species that adjust their movement to social and ecological conditions. In this study, we investigated the movement of eight GPS tracked calves (translocated in three cohorts) following their soft release into a 107 km(2) fenced wildlife sanctuary in northern Kenya and compared their movement with that of five tracked wild elephants in the sanctuary. We describe their exploration of the sanctuary, discovery of water points, and activity budgets during the first seven, 14, and 20 months after release. We explored how patterns are affected by time since release, ecological conditions, and social factors. We found that calves visited new areas of the sanctuary and water points during greener periods and earlier post-release. Social context was associated with exploration, with later release and association with wild elephants predictive of visits to new areas. Wild elephants tended to use a greater number of sites per 14-day period than the released calves. Activity budgets determined from hidden Markov models (including the states directed walk, encamped, and meandering) suggested that released calves differed from wild elephants. The first two cohorts of calves spent a significantly greater proportion of time in the directed walk state and a significantly lower proportion of time in the encamped state relative to the wild elephants. Our results represent a step forward in describing the movements of elephant orphan calves released to the wild following a period of profound social disruption when they lost their natal family and were rehabilitated with other orphan calves under human care. We discuss the implications of the elephant behavior we observed for improving release procedures and for defining success benchmarks for translocation projects.

AB  - Background and Aims: The card & oacute;n ( Pachycereus pringlei ) is a columnar cactus emblematic of the Sonoran Desert, a region where free-range livestock grazing has been present for centuries, both in the Baja California peninsula and in Sonora. However, the effect of livestock on the population dynamics of the card & oacute;n is unknown. The objective of this study was to analyze whether the exclusion of livestock for nearly three decades had any observable effect on the recruitment probability of the card & oacute;n and on the relationship of the new recruits with two nurse legumes ( Olneya tesota and Prosopis articulata ). Methods: The presence and size of card & oacute;n and the two nurse legumes were recorded in transects. These were distributed under two conditions, with livestock presence and with 27 years of livestock exclusion, in plots established in an arid shrubland in the south of the Baja California peninsula, Mexico. The study analyzed whether there were differences between these two conditions in (i) the recruitment probability of the card & oacute;n, and (ii) the association of new recruits with the nurse legumes. Key results: No differences were found in the recruitment probability between area with livestock and area with livestock exclusion. However, differences were observed in the association between recruited card & oacute;n individuals and nurse legumes, being positive in sites with livestock and absent in sites with livestock exclusion. Conclusions: The lack of differences in recruitment probability between conditions could be due to the influence of processes acting at spatio-temporal scales larger than those of our study. For example, the temporal scale, potentially multi-decadal, of card & oacute;n recruitment pulses or the spatial scale of activity ranges of pollinators, seed dispersers and consumers. Our results underscore the importance of spatio-temporal scale in studying the dynamics of long-lived species in arid regions.

AB  - Understanding the reproductive ecology of birds and the factors influencing nest predation is essential for developing scientifically sound and effective bird conservation strategies. Certain pheasant species sensitive to environmental changes are vulnerable to threats and face survival pressures such as habitat destruction and human activities. However, research related to their reproductive ecology is lacking. Here for the first time we reported information on breeding biology of the Chinese francolin (Francolinus pintadeanus). This study was conducted during the breeding seasons of the Chinese francolin in 2021, 2023, 2024, and 2025, combining traditional survey and infrared camera technology to monitor its reproductive ecology and nest predators in the Datian and Bangxi Reserves and to identify its potential predators through artificial nest experiments. All nests were open-ground nests located at the roots of dwarf shrubs and grasses. Our findings revealed that the breeding season of the Chinese francolin was mainly in March-September, peaking in May; its clutch size was 4.09 +/- 1.27 (N = 22), reproductive success was 27.27%, and 16 nests were failed; and all failed nests were predated, with abandoned nests accounting for 93.75% of the failed nests. In artificial nest experiments, the predation rates of Datian Reserve and Bangxi Reserve were 70.91% (N = 55) and 60.00% (N = 30), respectively, with no significant difference in predation rates between the fully covered and exposed groups (Datian: chi 2 = 0.258, p = 0.612; Bangxi: p = 0.710). Natural nest monitoring and artificial nest experiments on the Chinese francolin identified snakes and the small Indian civet (Viverricula indica) as the main predators in Datian Reserve, as well as the greater coucal (Centropus sinensis) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) as potential predators. In contrast, the main predators in Bangxi Reserve were snakes and rodents. These findings indicate differences in nest predator taxa between the two reserves. We recommend prioritizing the restoration of dwarf scrub vegetation and optimizing the habitat management strategy in these reserves to better protect the breeding habitats of pheasants while promoting long-term stability and continuation of their populations.

AB  - The decline and fragmentation of habitats areas are two main factors that lead to the reduction of biodiversity in landscape ecosystems. As a kind of large carnivores, South China tiger (Panthera tigris amoyensis) is one of the most endangered tiger subspecies and considered to be extinct in the wild. The Chinese government has intended to release a certain number of tigers into two of their historically habitats areas, Hupingshan-Houhe national nature reserves (NNR) in central-south China that provides suitable habitats for P. tigris. Because wild boar (Sus scrofa) is a prey of P. tigris, spatially characterizing the populations of the prey and its habitats is critical for the success of habituating the tigers to the areas. Although there has been effort made to protect the habitats of wild boar, there have been no report that deal with investigation and analysis of the habitat suitability and potential forwild boar, especially in terms of landscape connectivity. Herewe present the novel integration of the habitat suitability index (HSI) and graph-based network to identify the priority areas for wild boar dispersal in and around the NNR. In addition, a novel method to identify the proper connectivity distance to avoid excessive connectivity when the field data are essentially non-existent. Results showed that in summer andwinter, the potential habitat areas were 6848-10,245 and 5984-10,152km(2), respectively. The total area of the priority patches was 1590 km(2), approximately occupying 16% of the suitable habitat area. Our study indicated that the novel integration of the HSI and network analysis led to an effective approach to spatially characterize priority patches to support decision-making for landscape planning. The results shown here also have implications for future efforts for habituating large carnivores into their historical habitat regions. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Here we report the first record of the Marbeled spinefoot, Siganus rivulatus Forsskal and Niebuhr, 1775 (Acanthuriformes: Siganidae), collected in July 2022 from Maltese coastal waters. The specimen was identified through morphological characters and confirmed genetically through DNA barcoding, given that the family Siganidae is composed of several species belonging to only one genus with similar and overlapping morphological characters. Previous to this report, the closest record of S. rivulatus was off the island of Sicily. Thus, the presence of S. rivulatus in Maltese waters suggests that this species is expanding its distribution within the Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, this study compares this central Mediterranean record of S. rivulatus with genetic data of the Dusky spinefoot, Siganus luridus (Ruppell, 1829), a previously established species. Individual records of Siganus (rabbitfishes) are important to note, as they represent the first warning signs of a possible invasion. Previous work has shown that these species drastically alter the ecosystems of the Mediterranean region through their herbivorous diet and grazing behaviour. Therefore, we need to closely monitor for more individuals and establish mitigation measures against established and expanding populations of these two species.

AB  - An animal's movement is influenced by a plethora of internal and external factors, leading to individual- and habitat-specific movement characteristics. This plasticity is thought to allow individuals to exploit diverse environments efficiently. We tested whether the movement characteristics of white sharks Carcharodon carcharias differ across ontogeny and among habitats along the coast of Central California. In doing so, we elucidate how changes in internal state (physiological changes coinciding with body size) and external environments (differing seascapes and/or diel phases) shape the movement of this globally distributed predator. Twenty-one white sharks, from small juveniles to large adults, were equipped with motion-sensitive biologging tags at four contrasting seascapes: two islands, a headland, and an inshore cove. From multisensor biologging data, 20 metrics characterizing movement (i.e., depth use, vertical velocities, activity, turning rates, and bursting events) were derived and subjected to multivariate analyses. Movement characteristics were most different across seascapes, followed by ontogeny and diel phase. Juvenile sharks, which were only encountered at the cove, displayed the most distinct movement characteristics. Sharks at this seascape remained close to the shore traveling over smaller areas, shallower depth ranges, and with lower levels of tail beat frequencies, when corrected for size, than sub-adult and adult sharks tagged elsewhere. Distinct tortuous daytime versus linear nighttime horizontal movements were recorded from sharks at island seascapes but not from those at the headland or inshore cove. At the offshore islands, the linear nighttime swimming patterns coincided with repeated dives to and from deeper water. The availability of prey and access to deeper water are likely drivers of the differences in movement characteristics described, with varying demographics of pinniped prey found at the subadult and adult aggregation areas and juvenile sharks being piscivorous and their habitat neither adjacent to pinniped haul out areas nor deeper water. This study demonstrates plasticity in the movements of a top predator, which adapts its routine to suit the habitat it forages within.

Since then, the article has suggested some solutions to improve people's participation in agricultural value chain development of wild pigs and wild pork. Thom, BT., & Huy, D.T.N (2021) stated Feeding wild pigs and managing wild pork meat quality is meaningful in Vietnam, esp. In Thai Nguyen province as pork products can offer variety of tastes due to food processing and suitable for Vietnamese tastes and can export to the world widely. Feeding wild board in different environment also affect quality of wild pork meat, for example in US, Brazil or In Vietnam It is in the study we will make comparison to wild pork meat in China and Thailand and suggest to enhance vale chain linkage of wild pork and wild pigs to enhance exporting markets. Last but not least, better value chain linkage can be enhanced through reducing transaction costs from wild pig farming to factories and producing wild pork meat following European standards or GlobalGAP or VIETGAP.

AB  - Invasive organisms can alter host-parasite relationships in a given ecosystem by spreading exotic parasites and/or becoming a new reservoir for native ones. Since these problems affect management programs of the invasive host organisms, it is necessary to monitor them individually. The Pallas's squirrel Callosciurus erythraeus is an invasive arboreal mammal introduced into Japan that threatens to exacerbate ecological and public health problems by spreading native and exotic parasites. However, only limited surveys have been available especially for ectoparasites, using the traditional combing method in which the possibility of oversight is inherent. Here, we evaluated the ectoparasite occurrences in Kanto region of Japan, using the whole-shaving method as an alternative approach. As a result of examining 52 hosts from two invaded districts (Yokohama and Yokosuka), chigger mites (Leptotrombidium spp.) and fleas (Ceratophyllus anisus and Ceratophyllus indages indages) were newly recovered in addition to the previously reported tick (Haemaphysalis flava) and exotic lice (Enderleinellus kumadai and Neophaematoponis callosciuri). The parasite burdens were higher in Yokosuka and in male host individuals, affecting infracommunity richness and composition. Our findings on the variety of native and exotic ectoparasites, at higher abundances in some cases than previously known, may suggest that both the spillover and spillback risks need to be adjusted upwards.

AB  - Globally, African savanna elephants have been assessed as 'endangered'. Consequently, additional threats and losses due to human-elephant conflict (HEC) could further exacerbate the species' decline. In stark contrast, South Africa's elephant populations are mostly confined within fenced-in reserves that impede natural processes such as migration. As ecosystem engineers, elephant population growth herein should be limited. Within South Africa, elephant management has evolved as differing wildlife philosophies from utilitarian conservation ('nature for man') to biocentric preservation ('nature for nature') and a combination thereof, have been practiced. Traditionally, both HEC and population control have been largely synonymous with lethal control, i.e. culling. However, with the increase of public or expert input to Policy, lethal control is not favoured by the public. As an alternative, immunocontraception of female African savanna elephants through non-invasive, native porcine zona pellucida (pZP) vaccinations has been employed successfully and is currently adopted in 43 elephant reserves across South Africa. Current legislation now recommends culling as the last population management resort. Newly promulgated legislation calls for wellbeing and welfare to be carefully measured in all biodiversity management decisions taken to minimise threats to biodiversity. As a keystone species, elephant is a direct driver of biodiversity change. Accordingly, and in light of these developments, all population management options, including immunocontraception, must be fully considered in South Africa's largest national park, the Kruger.

AB  - This study explored the role of the hydrological regime as a trigger factor for wildlife roadkill along a 22 km road crossing the Taim Wetland, a Ramsar site of international importance in South Brazil. The north-south crossing of BR-471, a federal highway, causes fatalities to numerous animals due to collisions with vehicles. An 11-year long-term time series study encompassing monthly roadkill incidents, water level, and rainfall was analyzed by considering three different periods related to a Wildlife Protection System (WPS): (i) 3 initial years before the WPS implementation (BWPS); (ii) 4 intermediate years after the WPS implementation (AWPS), which includes fences, fauna tunnels, cattle guard stocks, bumps, and speed control; (iii) 4 final years during partial destruction of the WPS (PDWPS). A pseudo-2D full hydrodynamic cell model was employed to fill missing water level data. The model had a good to very good performance (NSE: 0.73 to 0.87; R-2: 0.79 to 0.90). The relationship between roadkill incidents and the WPS periods (BWPS, AWPS, and PDWPS) was modeled using Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS), considering rainfall and water level as predictor variables. The analysis revealed a higher incidence of wildlife roadkill in BWPS compared to AWPS and PDWPS, suggesting the effectiveness of the implemented measures. Critical season and interplay between water levels, rainfall, and the roadkill were assessed. Mammals was the most common roadkill class identified (similar to 92%), followed by reptiles (13%) and birds (2%), with no change in these percentual in the BWPS, AWPS, and PDWPS. Among mammals, capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) and coypu (Myocastor coypu) were the most frequent victims (similar to 93% of mammals). Winter, followed by autumn, recorded the highest number of roadkill incidents (> 60%), and this pattern remained consistent during the three periods. While rainfall did not emerge as a determining variable for roadkill, water levels above certain thresholds (> 3.3 m) drastically diminished the effectiveness of the WPS, mainly due to fauna tunnel submersion. These findings offer valuable insights for enhancing wildlife conservation strategies in this protected area by incorporating hydrological information providing a baseline for designing WPS in similar environments.

AB  - Animal agriculture is recognized as a key source of fecal microbial impacts on water quality and associated risks to human health. Most of the research effort has focused on losses of fecal microbes from cow/cattle feces with little research effort on sheep fecal risks. The literature on fecal microbial risks from pasture is complicated by the fact that experiments are carried out in different environments leading to difficulties in making direct comparisons between sheep and cow/cattle losses from pasture areas. In this study, a plot scale simulation was conducted on the same pasture plots, using simulated rainfall to generate comparable runoff conditions, and using simulated grazing to create similar relative stocking rates. The Escherichia coli concentrations in the runoff were similar from simulated or natural rainfall events. At an equivalent stocking rate, the E. coli runoff concentrations from the sheep grazed pastures were four times higher than the cow grazed pasture. These results show that at an equivalent stocking rate, the E. coli runoff risk from sheep grazed pasture is higher than for cow grazed pasture. Further research is needed to understand the relative impacts of different grazing species of animals as well as stocking rate or management effects on these relative risks to water quality.

AB  - Everglades of south Florida, USA, is a unique natural wildlife area, which is home to a diverse array of native herpetofaunal species. The Everglades have undergone transformations fueled by ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation, hydrological modification, a deluge of introduced exotic and invasive species, and the implementation of various ecosystem-wide restoration projects. Here, we analyzed trends in the herpetofaunal research over a 20-y period between 2001 and 2021 by conducting a review of the published scientific literature. We conducted a separate review of unpublished abstracts from the Greater Everglades Ecosystem Restoration Conference (GEER) to compare localized research trends and to include research that may not have been published in a peer-reviewed journal. We included 235 papers in our literature review of published articles and 150 poster and paper presentations from the GEER meetings from 2001-2021. We found a significant positive trend in the number of studies on Everglades herpetofauna over this period, driven primarily by an increase in research focused on invasive species. In addition, there are taxonomic biases in the literature, with Crocodilians being significantly over-represented relative to their taxon diversity and Caudates completely absent. Studies on a single invasive species, the Burmese Python (Python bivittatus), account for 22% of all published literature during this period and 30% of all GEER presentations. This review highlights both broad trends and large gaps in the Everglades herpetofaunal research and offers direction for future studies seeking to provide a more complete assessment of Everglades reptiles and amphibians.

AB  - A total of 3,639 deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) were reported on Missouri roadways in 2020, resulting in 348 injuries and 5 deaths. Of these accidents, 490 (13.5%) occurred along 1,200 miles of interstates. Although fewer in number, interstate crashes are more serious than others, often causing bodily injury and property damage. This descriptive study investigated DVCs on Missouri interstates using aerial photographs and street-side images on Google Maps to assess adjacent land use characteristics and determine the presence of corridors, if any, at each location. Of the DVC sites, 449 (91.6%) were near a natural corridor (n = 212, 47.2%), an artificial corridor (n = 139, 31.0%), or a combination of both (n = 98, 21.8%). Some examples of natural corridors included vegetation, water, and dry creeks. Artificial corridors consisted of secondary roads, fence rows, public utilities, and overpasses. The average distance from the DVC to the nearest corridor was 107.0 m. Analysis of variance revealed a significant difference between the types of corridors (p < 0.05), yet Duncan's multiple range test showed only one homogeneous subset. Most interstates bisected natural corridors, but over a third (38.8%) of them had trees on one side or the other, not both. The influence of half and artificial corridors is an important finding in this study, one that has not been reported in the literature. Results can be useful for transportation officials to warn motorists when the risk of DVCs is greatest on Missouri interstates.

AB  - Large species that are isolated for thousands of years on islands often evolve extreme degrees of dwarfism. Very little is known about physiological processes that accompany such extreme transitions in extinct dwarf species. We tested whether physiological cycles of bone maintenance (remodelling) in dwarf adult hippopotamuses correlate with insularity-driven body mass shifts that may occur due to variables such as ecological release from predation pressure and change in access to resources. We hypothesised that hippopotamuses with the smallest body size should show higher values of osteocyte lacunae, proxies for osteoblast proliferation during cycles of remodelling, when compared to relatively larger dwarf forms, as well as much larger mainland common hippopotamuses. We examined 20 ribs from three extinct Pleistocene Hippopotamus species spanning a gradient in body size: H. minor (similar to 132 kg, Cyprus), H. creutzburgi (similar to 398 kg, Crete), and H. antiquus (similar to 3200 kg, mainland Greece). Ribs were selected because they reflect bone metabolic rates that are not completely clouded by factors such as biomechanics. Densities of osteocyte lacunae (Ot.Dn) were examined in 864 individual secondary osteons observed in histology sections. We found the highest average Ot.Dn in the H. minor ribs, intermediate Ot.Dn in the H. creutzburgi ribs, and the lowest Ot.Dn in the H. antiquus ribs. It appears that Ot.Dn distinctly separated these three species, possibly signifying a gradient in bone remodelling such that bone tissue optimises maintenance in the face of insularity-driven reduction of body size. We discuss hippopotamus rib bone microstructure and the utility of Ot.Dn in palaeontological analyses for elucidating intricate biological processes occurring in bone of insular fossil mammals.

AB  - Pathogens like bacteria and protozoa, which affect human and animal health worldwide, can be transmitted by vectors like ticks. To investigate the epidemiology and genetic diversity of bacteria and protozoans carried by ticks in Chengmai county of Hainan province, China, 285 adult hard ticks belonging to two species [Rhipicephalus sanguineus (sensu lato): 183, 64.21% and Rhipicephalus microplus: 102, 35.79%] from dogs, cattle, and goats were collected. Microbial families were identified in these ticks by amplifying the 18S rRNA, 16S rRNA (rrs), citrate synthase (gltA), and heat shock protein (groEL) genes. Our data revealed the presence of four recognized species and two Candidatus spp. of Anaplasmataceae and Coxiellaceae. In sum, these data reveal an extensive diversity of Anaplasmataceae bacteria, Coxiellaceae bacteria, Babesiidae, and Hepatozoidae in ticks from Hainan Island, highlighting the need to understand the tick borne pathogen infection in local animals and humans.

AB  - More than 18% of the cases of invasive mammals worldwide correspond to South America, including small rodents and large species such as deer and hippos. Among exotic mammals in Colombia, we can mention pigs (Sus scrofa), which are well established, mainly in the Orinoquia region of the country, and more recently, hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius) with a growing area of occurrence in the middle and lower basin of the Magdalena River in the inter-Andean zone. In May 2022, a spotted exotic deer was documented in the area based on direct and indirect observations (photographs and videos) of living individuals and a partial skeleton. The spotted pattern of the photographed adults (absent in native or other exotic deer) and the juvenile individuals and the shape of the antlers show that they are chitals (Axis axis), a species native to Asia. Compared with the white-tailed deer Odocoileus, the largest native deer species in Colombia, the Axis skeleton was one-third bigger, which corroborated the identification. According to local inhabitants' communications, the number of Axis has increased, and groups of up to 18 individuals have been recorded. This is the first time that exotic deer have been documented in Colombia. Their presence may impact natural regeneration and competitively displace other native herbivores, which calls for the mitigation and control of the population since its establishment and dispersal can be cryptic.

AB  - Little is known about the interdependencies between livestock production and biodiversity. The swine sector is characterized by a diversity of extensive and intensive production practices, which rely on a wide range of natural and manmade activities (e.g., different use of the land) that can reduce its adverse effects on biodiversity. The Nero d'Abruzzo pig is a black domestic pig from the Abruzzo region, Italy, that is reared with extensive practice. This study using a proteomics approach aimed to investigate breed differences between the autochthon Nero d'Abruzzo and commercial-hybrid pigs commonly used by the industry. The comparison of the protein profile of muscle exudate obtained following centrifugation from the diaphragm of the two pig breeds highlight significant differences in the protein expression of a large pool of proteins. Among the proteins that were upregulated or downregulated differently in the two pigs, three-fatty acid synthase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase-may contribute in part to explaining, according to their functions, the phenotypic differences between the pigs. This work has identified a cohort of proteins that can be potentially useful to define new molecular phenotypes for novel applications in pig breeding programs and are of great interest for future work.
   Capital-driven animal husbandry systems undertaken in the last century led to the abandoning of many pig breeds that were not profitable. These local pig breeds and their respective production systems have great potential as they are able to respond to the high criteria and needs of modern society concerning some environmental aspects, animal-welfare, healthiness, etc. This is the case of the black pigs of Italy. The Apulo-Calabrese is a breed of black pig, known by many other names such as Nero d'Abruzzo. In order to further understand the biological differences between different types of porcine genetics (Nero d'Abruzzo and commercial-hybrid) we used a label-free LC-MS strategy and Western-blot to characterize the proteomes of muscle-exudate collected from these pigs. This proteomics approach identified 1669 proteins of which 100 changed significantly in abundance between breeds. Bioinformatics functional analysis indicated that differentially expressed proteins were involved in several biological processes related to energy-metabolism and response to oxidative stress, suggesting that these functions might distinguish between these pigs. Fatty-acid synthase, catalase and glutathione-peroxidase, involved in enzymatic activity were found to be more represented in samples obtained from the Nero d'Abruzzo. This biological information can potentially provide new biological factors that could determine the different production performances of these pigs, distinguished by their different genetic backgrounds.

AB  - Wombats are native herbivorous grazers that have adapted to Australia's low-quality forage. Studies on diet selection by bare-nosed wombats (Vombatus ursinus) are limited and are either observational or based on microhistological studies. The current study determined the diet of wombats through DNA metabarcoding across five study sites in New South Wales over a one-year period. Metabarcoding was chosen as it is non-invasive, less time consuming and more specific than traditional techniques. The list of 209 plant species identified as eaten by wombats in this study is much higher than previously reported, with grasses being the most common plant group identified in all samples. Most dietary items identified were introduced plant species. Seasonal differences in plants eaten occurred at four of the five study sites and may reflect dietary abundance and floristic composition at different times of year. Further studies are required to determine if the dietary items differ markedly across the entire range of wombats, and if nutrition influences dietary preferences.

AB  - Jaguars and pumas are top-predator species in the Neotropics that are threatened by habitat destruction, illegal poaching of their body parts and their favored prey, and by the human-wildlife conflicts that arise when predators attack livestock. Much of the remaining felid habitat in the Americas is in protected nature reserves that are too small and isolated to support local populations. Surrounding forests therefore play a vital role in felid conservation. Successful long-term conservation of these two felids requires evidence-based knowledge of their biological and ecological requirements. We studied population distributions of jaguars and pumas and their prey in and between two small, private reserves of the Northern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, with areas of 25 and 43 km(2). During 2 years of camera trapping (2015 and 2016), we detected 21 jaguars, from which we estimated an average space requirement of 28-45 km(2)/individual. Dietary niche overlap exceeded random expectation. The most frequently occurring prey items in jaguar and puma diets were collared peccary and deer. Jaguar also favored nine-banded armadillos and white-nosed coati, while puma favored canids. Both felids avoided ocellated turkey. Overall, diet of jaguars was less species-rich, but similar in niche breadth, to that of pumas. A fluid use of space by both species, in 2015 tending toward mutual attraction and in 2016 toward partial exclusion of pumas by jaguars, combined with the high dietary overlap, is consistent with a dominance hierarchy facilitating coexistence. Jaguars and pumas favor the same prey as the people in local communities who hunt, which likely will intensify human-wildlife impacts when prey become scarce. We conclude that even small reserves play an important role in increasing the continuity of habitat for prey and large felids, whose generalist habits suppress interspecific competition for increasingly limiting prey that are largely shared between them and humans.

AB  - Lynx populations in Estonia and Latvia have recently become a conservation concern due to both natural and anthropogenic causes. Harsh winters with a thick snow cover more than a decade ago led to a rapid decrease in roe deer numbers, followed by a severe lynx population decline and slow recovery. In the near future, a high fence currently under construction at the borders with Russia and Belarus will most likely halt the transboundary gene flow. Therefore, to avoid the erosion of genetic diversity, it is vital to make every effort to maintain the gene flow, especially between Estonia and Latvia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the transboundary population structure and extent of gene flow between populations of Estonia and Latvia, and find areas where the gene flow can be most vulnerable. Microsatellite loci were genotyped for 561 individuals (290 from Estonia and 271 from Latvia) collected in 2006-2015. Population clustering and spatial analyses indicate that lynxes in western Latvia are partially isolated, having limited gene flow with other areas. Individuals in western Latvia are also characterized by a significantly lower level of heterozygosity and higher inbreeding. This can be attributed to the reduced availability of high-quality lynx habitats between western and central Latvia, acting as a partial migration barrier. Spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed females exhibiting stronger philopatry compared to males. Migration barriers such as the low-quality habitats and border fences are the major conservation concerns to be considered when developing future action plans for lynx, but also for other mammal populations.

AB  - Pollen analysis is increasingly being used to investigate the landscape context of the end of Roman Britain, and specifically the extent to which there was continuity or change in land use and farming practices. Approaches vary from the use of single off-site pollen sequences to the assessment of databases of large numbers of sites, but all are faced with the necessity of considering key interpretative issues such as pollen source areas and chronological precision. This paper presents an overview and critique of pollen-based approaches to the question of post-Roman landscape continuity and change, highlighting the need for caution in site selection, inter-site comparison, and in extrapolation to the landscape scale. Consideration is given to what is meant by continuity in palaeoenvironmental terms, based on ecological studies of vegetation responses to grazing exclusion and land abandonment. The implications of these studies for future approaches to detection of post-Roman landscape continuity and change in palaeoenvironmental sequences are discussed.

Currently, many are the factors that threaten its survival. Aim of this paper is to provide the first data on the spatio-temporal co-occurrence between the only free-ranging Greek population of common fallow deer and local domestic caprines. Kilometric abundance index (KAI) was derived from spotlight counts. The unattended domestic caprines appear to impact on fallow deer, in particular during fawning season. Livestock monitoring over time can act as a proxy indicator of the status of this deer population.

AB  - Simple Summary In Lithuania, African swine fever (ASF) notifications in domestic pigs and wild boar have been increasing since the entry of ASF from 2014 to 2018. The disease caused serious economic losses and affected commercial and non-commercial pig holdings. We conducted a prospective matched case-control study to investigate the potential risk factors associated with ASF outbreaks in pig farms in Lithuania in 2019. The study revealed that the risk of ASF occurrence in a pig farm was significantly lower if the farm had been inspected by veterinary inspectors, while the risk increased if certain activities, possibly related to the indirect transmission of ASF to a pig farm, were practiced on a farm, e.g., mushroom picking, sharing equipment, etc. Veterinary inspection seemed to increase the level of biosecurity and ASF awareness on a farm, which may have helped to prevent disease introduction. These findings can be used to improve the control and prevention of ASF in domestic pigs in countries affected by ASF. While numerous risk factors of African swine fever (ASF) transmission to domestic pigs have been described, ASF virus introduction has often not been traced back to one single defined cause. The large number of ASF outbreaks that occurred in domestic pigs in Lithuania from 2014 through to 2018 raised the question regarding whether outbreak-specific risk factors and transmission routes could be identified. Therefore, a prospective matched case-control study was designed. Data from 18 outbreaks that occurred in Lithuanian in 2019 and 36 control farms were analyzed. Conditional multivariable logistic regression showed that two or more visits by veterinary inspection of a farm had a significant preventive effect on the occurrence of ASF on a farm (Odds ratio (OR) 14.21, confidence interval (CI) 1.09-185.60 for farms not inspected vs. farms inspected twice or more a year), while certain practices (e.g., mushroom picking, sharing equipment, etc.), which might facilitate the indirect introduction of ASF from fields and forests into piggeries, significantly increased the odds of an outbreak (OR 5.18, CI 1.10-24.44). The results of the study highlight the importance of veterinary inspections for increasing the biosecurity level on pig farms and the awareness of ASF. The knowledge on potential protective and risk factors may help to improve the prevention and control of ASF outbreaks in domestic pig farms in Lithuania and other affected countries.

AB  - Lotus eremiticus is an endemic species from La Palma World Biosphere Reserve. It has a small distribution range, low population size, and is threatened by introduced herbivores. Since these threats have not been removed from the protected area, they were excluded by building a fence. The land where the species grows is private property, so an agreement with the landowner was reached to permit measures to favor its recovery. During 2008-2019, as a result of this agreement and the conservation efforts, a large population increase occurred, from the initial 5 individuals to the 30 plants that are currently distributed at the original site. Furthermore, these measures allow the species to maintain stable population dynamics, meaning that this endangered species is itself capable of recovery if the threat is removed. This is a good example of how land stewardship is an effective tool to conserve endangered species.

AB  - There are currently 12 recognised extant species of giant clams (Cardiidae: Tridacninae) inhabiting the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific. Six species have been newly described or rediscovered since 1982, such as the recently resurrected species Tridacna elongatissima in the Western Indian Ocean. In order to investigate the distribution range of this species, 24 specimens have been collected and identified by DNA barcoding. This study provides the first record for T. elongatissima in Tanzania and expands both the northern (Zanzibar, Tanzania) and southern (Ponta de Ouro, Mozambique) ranges of this species.

AB  - Although wild boar invasion is a common human-wildlife conflict worldwide, it is difficult to solve. Understanding the characteristics of wild boar invasion into farmland, accurately predicting the areas where wild boar invasions will occur, and implementing effective prevention and control measures are key to effectively alleviating conflicts between humans and wild boars. From 2021 to 2023, we conducted field surveys and experimentally determined the effectiveness of prevention and control measures in the Huanan and Tonghe Counties in order to explore the landscape and farmland factors affecting wild boar invasion, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of different combinations of prevention and control measures. The results indicate that the mean patch area, patch area coefficient of variation, and forest type edge density show positive linear correlations with the invaded area, which is positively associated with the presence of ditches and negatively correlated with the existence of electronic fences. Meanwhile, there are non-linear relationships between invasion and the edge density of farmland type, the proportion of forests, the Shannon uniformity index, the proportion of residential areas, the distance from the village, the distance from the forest, and the population density. In particular, the risk of wild boar invasion is higher in the border area between forest and farmland. The loss rate of farmland under the different control measures (compound) was significantly lower than that in the electronic fence group (single) (p < 0.05). Based on these findings, we put forward the following suggestions for the prevention and control of wild boar: (1) widen and deepen the narrow landscape elements around farmland; (2) focus on the border area between forest and farmland; and (3) use compound prevention and control measures. This study provides a comprehensive foundation for future wild boar prevention and control research, and it contributes to the formulation of effective wild boar prevention and control policies worldwide.

AB  - The wild camel (Camelus ferus) is a critically endangered species found in extremely arid environments of Central Asia. The wild camel population and its distribution areas have decreased significantly since the middle of the 19th century. The species is now restricted to four isolated habitats in China and Mongolia, and more than 20 years have passed since the most recent surveys of its status and distribution. In an effort to get more current information, we conducted ground surveys, coupled with ad-libitum interviews of local residents, in the geographic range of wild camels in China from 2011 to 2013. We aim to present the most up to date status and distribution of wild camels and provide effective management and conservation strategies. We identified three subpopulations (Taklimakan Desert, Kumtagh Desert, border area of China and Mongolia). The wild camel population in the Kumtagh Desert was found to be stable and relatively dense, likely due to large areas of protected habitat. Camel presence in the Taklimakan Desert was further south than previously reported, indicating an expansion or range shift in distribution that may have been driven by high levels of anthropogenic disturbance. No signs of camels were found in the border area, likely due to a substantial border fence that impedes animal movement. Protected areas appear to work at improving camel populations and will be imperative for their persistence across their currently known range. Continued monitoring is needed to deduce camel movement, and connectivity between China and Mongolia improved. We also recommend surveys in the very near future to determine how populations may have changed since the surveys presented herein were undertaken.

AB  - Context A better understanding of animal habitat use informs fundamental ecology and can provide underpinnings for effective management.Aims This study explored the temporal variation in feeding ground utilisation by dugongs (Dugong dugon) in two intertidal seagrass beds in Talibong Island, Thailand (Sites A and B), focusing on the distribution and direction of dugong feeding trails.Methods Drone-based aerial photography was conducted quarterly over 1 year and daily over 2 weeks to observe feeding trails and behaviour.Key results During five and seven separate photography periods over 1 year, 0.04 +/- 0.01% (range: 0.03-0.06%) of Site A (200,000 m2) was covered with new feeding trails daily, while 0.35 +/- 0.31% (range: 0.07-0.96%) of Site B (278,000 m2) was covered daily. This temporal variation in the feeding trail area corresponded to that in seagrass coverage. Daily observations over 2 weeks during six separate photography periods revealed a significant decrease in overlapping rates (intersection over union) of the core areas (50% kernel density estimation [KDE]) as time elapsed. The 1-year observation highlighted relatively higher overlapping rates of home ranges (95% KDE) (Site A: 0.27 +/- 0.09; Site B: 0.49 +/- 0.08) and low overlapping rates of core areas (Site A: 0.02 +/- 0.03; Site B: 0.09 +/- 0.09). The relative frequencies of the feeding trail direction remained consistent across survey seasons, and the most and least dominant directions were common across all survey seasons and sites. The circular correlation coefficient between the directions of dugong body axis and the estimated tidal current was 0.45, suggesting that feeding generally occurred in the upstream direction. The direction and spatial range of dugong feeding may be affected by temporally consistent factors. One factor that can affect the feeding direction is the tidal current.Conclusions Overall, dugongs may feed and move within seagrass beds in a temporally consistent manner, even when there are shifts in feeding hotspots.Implications This research enhances our understanding of how dugongs utilise their feeding grounds and highlights the importance of not only identifying feeding hotspots but also predicting their feeding routes by considering the direction and distribution of feeding trails.

AB  - Distant hybridization is an important breeding method in aquaculture. However, hybrid escape is frequent in aquaculture and may have a negative impact on indigenous species. In addition to reducing the fertility of hy-brids, inhibiting their wild viability can also play a role in avoiding the ecological risk of escaped hybrids. Postzygotic ecological isolation refers to the phenomenon of reduced adaptation of hybrids in the parent envi-ronment (wild), such as the incompatibility between their phenotypes and their behavior or food resources, which suggests that differences in parental feeding habits may also weaken the adaptability of the hybrids in the wild. In this study, we compared external and skeletal traits related to feeding habits in carnivorous Percocypris pingi (PP), herbivorous Schizothorax wangchiachii (SW), their F1 hybrids (PS), and omnivorous S. davidi (SD). Then, we selected fish, shrimp, chironomid larvae, and periphytic algae as food resources corresponding to different ecological niches and carried out a short-term single-food feeding experiment (sufficient food) under monoculture and a 60-day mixed-food feeding experiment (limited food) under polyculture. We found that PS and SD had similar traits, which were intermediate between those of PP and SW. In the single-food experiment, PS and SD had no significant difference in the foraging level of the four food resources, and they showed little foraging for fish and algae. However, SD showed stronger competitive ability than PS under polyculture (feeding chironomid larvae). In the 60-day ecological simulation experiment, PS could barely forage for fish and shrimp, and its ecological niche was close to that of SW. PS did not gain weight during the experiment, which indirectly reflected its low adaptability in the wild. In summary, the concept of postzygotic ecological isolation was introduced into aquaculture for the first time in this study. Moreover, this study also suggests that reducing the ecological risk caused by the escape of transgenic and genome edited varieties can not only by reducing their fertility, but also by reducing their ecological adaptability, which may lead to their elimination at the larval stage in the wild. This provides new insights for the genetic containment of genetically improved varieties.

AB  - Camellia japonica, an evergreen ornamental plant in the Theaceae family, has a natural range that is now shrinking. This is evident by the fact that the species is on the verge of extinction in Laoshan Mountain (Qingdao), the northernmost area of China known to have a natural population of C. japonica. Little is known about the genetic diversity and relationships among cultivated and wild C. japonica populations. One hundred and eighty samples of six C. japonica populations were tested for genetic diversity with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers; these included three cultivated populations, two natural populations in Qingdao, and one natural population in Daqingshan. The average values of polymorphism information content (PIC), expected heterozygosity (He), and Shannon's information index (I) were 0.5849, 0.6385 and 1.3170, respectively, indicating that C. japonica has a high genetic diversity. The genetic diversities of the six populations in rank order were as follows: Daqingshan > Zhongshan Park > Changmenyan Island > Daguan Island > Botanical Garden > May Fourth Square. The geographical isolation of the islands had no significant influence on the genetic diversity of C. japonica. Clustering results showed that the six C. japonica populations could be grouped into three categories, and most populations were clustered according to their geographical origin and genetic background. These results also reconfirmed that the C. japonica (Naidong) population in Qingdao originated from Changmenyan Island. Genetic variation was highest within populations (89%), indicating that C. japonica can be protected at the population level. These findings will prove useful for the genetic analysis, protection, and horticultural use of C. japonica.

AB  - Simple Summary This study investigates the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in small ruminant farms (159 sheep and 39 goats) in southern Spain, a key area for the country's livestock production. This research reveals that Eimeria spp. Is the most common parasitic infection, followed by Strongyles. Other parasites, like Moniezia spp., Trichuris spp., and D. dendriticum, are less prevalent but more common in sheep. This study also includes a survey on farmers' management practices, highlighting that regular monitoring through coprological analyses is not common; veterinarians are seldom involved in deworming plans, and anthelmintic treatment is typically applied twice a year in sheep and once in goats. This report suggests that implementing certain management measures could potentially mitigate parasite infections. This constitutes the first report on the epidemiological status of gastrointestinal parasites in small ruminants in southern Spain.Abstract The primary population of small ruminants in Spain is concentrated in the southern region, a critical area for the country's livestock production. Indirect economic losses can occur when this livestock is affected by gastrointestinal parasites. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of these parasites in small ruminant herds (159 sheep and 39 goats) through coprological analyses and conducted a survey on farmers' management practices related to gastrointestinal parasite control. The survey results revealed some important aspects: monitoring through coprological analyses is not a common practice; veterinarians are not typically involved in deworming plans; anthelmintic treatment in adults is often applied twice a year in sheep and once a year in goats; and finally, drug rotation was higher in sheep farms. Coprological analyses showed Eimeria spp. as the most common parasitic infection, followed by Strongyles infection. Other parasites like Moniezia spp., Trichuris spp., and D. dendriticum were less important, although their prevalence was higher in sheep than goats. This constitutes the first report on the epidemiological status of gastrointestinal parasites in small ruminants in southern Spain. Based on the survey findings, the introduction of certain management measures on farms could potentially mitigate parasite infections.

AB  - The current study records a new distributional range for Elysia cf. leucolegnote Jensen, 1990, which was previously reported only from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India. The collection was carried out in the mangroves of Kali Estuary situated in Karnataka (14 degrees 50(y)55.27 '' N, 74 degrees 9(y)44.04 '' E & 14 degrees 50(y)16.36 '' N, 74 degrees 10(y)8.81 '' E), southwest coast of India. Prior studies had documented the distribution of this species in the tropical West Pacific and East Indian Oceans; this study reports the first record of E. cf. leucolegnote in the Northwestern Indian Ocean, expanding its documentation of a wider distribution range. The species was first discovered in Hong Kong and described in 1990. It was identified by its distinctive morphological characteristics, which featured black eyes situated proximally at the base of the rhinophores and a flattened, generally green body with a distinct white border line along the rhinophores and parapodia.

AB  - Toxocara vitulorum (Nematoda: Ascaridida) is a common parasite of cattle and buffaloes in tropical and subtropical regions and the causative agent of toxocarosis in calves. In Europe, sporadic infections have been reported in cattle, but also in bovines held at zoological gardens. Here, we report T. vitulorum infections in a herd of American bison (Bison bison) kept at the Vienna Zoo, Austria, which occurred in 2023 and 2024. After the first case in a seven-week-old calf in July 2023, another case in a five-week-old calf was diagnosed in May 2024, both of them detected by coproscopy and fecal discharge of adult worms after anthelminthic treatment. The calves originated from two different mothers imported to the zoo in 2014 from the Czech Republic and 2012 from Germany respectively. Both calves showed diarrhea and fecal soiling of the anal region prior to fecal analysis. Two intramuscular administrations of ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg bodyweight, two-week interval) caused the passing of up to 39 cm long gravid female worms, resulted in the cessation of egg shedding and improved fecal consistency. Morphological and molecular identification confirmed infections with T. vitulorum. Additionally, another calf, born in May 2024 from the mother of the calf that was T. vitulorum-positive in 2023, showed periods of diarrhea. Due to difficulties in taking individual samples, no definitive diagnosis of T. vitulorum infection could be made, however, the animal was also treated and clinically improved afterwards. Besides T. vitulorum, Eimeria spp. were detected in all samples and Giardia duodenalis genotype E in two samples in 2024. This case series highlights the possibility of unnoticed parasite introductions into zoological gardens via animals infected with resting parasite stages, and demonstrates the importance of regular individual parasitological analysis in bovine zoo animals during the first weeks after birth.

AB  - IntroductionPlant chemical defenses can influence the distribution, community composition, and abundance of soil biota. Urbanization plays a key role in shaping soil biotic communities either directly through changes in soil properties or indirectly via changes in plant characteristics such as defense traits. The effects of urbanization and plant defenses on the abundance and structure of aboveground plant-associated communities have been studied, yet their effects on belowground root-associated communities are poorly understood. MethodsHere we sampled white clover (Trifolium repens L.) leaves and roots along urban-rural gradients in the cities of Antwerp and Ghent, Belgium. We measured production of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in leaves, a known defense trait against herbivores, and abundances of different feeding guilds of nematodes associated with the roots. ResultsWe found that HCN production decreased with increasing levels of urbanization in both cities. Urbanization was significantly correlated with shifts in root-associated nematode community structure in Antwerp but not in Ghent. Responses of nematode feeding guilds and trophic groups to urbanization were highly dependent on the clovers' HCN production, especially in Ghent. Changes in nematode channel ratio in Antwerp indicated that urban root-associated nematode communities of white clover were more strongly dominated by fungivorous nematodes. DiscussionOur results demonstrate that urbanization is driving changes in a plant phenotypic trait and in the community structure of root-associated nematodes, as well as that both changes interact. Plant defense mechanisms could thus help elucidate the effects of urbanization on root-associated biota communities. As strong differences existed between the two studied cities, the particular properties of cities should be taken into account to better understand the direction and strength of phenotypic trait changes driven by urbanization.

AB  - Background
   Hybridization is an evolutionary event present in the natural world. Several studies suggest that natural hybridization is an important process in plant evolution, creating new genetic combinations which can play a vital role in speciation (Soltis and Soltis 2009, Soltis 2013, Neri et al. 2017, Taylor and Larson 2019). Therefore, it is important to understand and protect naturally occurring hybrids, conserving their ecological novelties and new traits, such as the ability to explore new niches, different from those of the parental species (Soltis 2013, Supple and Shapiro 2018).
   The British Virgin Islands (BVI) is a UK Overseas Territory situated in the Caribbean biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al. 2000). To date, three natural hybrids are known to occur within this territory: Tillandsia x lineatispica Mez, Anthurium x selloanum K.Koch and Coccoloba krugii x C. uvifera R.A.Howard (Howard 1957, Acevedo-Rodriguez and Strong 2005, Acevedo-Rodriguez and Strong 2012).
   Tillandsia x lineatispica is endemic to the Puerto Rican Bank, occurring in Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands (USVI) and the British Virgin Islands with an extent of occurrence estimated to be 3,390 km and a limited number of locations. The suitable habitat for this hybrid is declining mainly due to the negative impacts of feral ungulates, development for tourism and residential infrastructure and the impact of human-induced wildfires. In addition, it is suspected that the global population does not exceed 10,000 individuals with the largest subpopulation on Beef Island in the BVI thought to have no more than 1,000 mature individuals. This hybrid is therefore evaluated as Vulnerable, based on IUCN Red List Criteria, B1a(iii)+2b(iii) + C2a(i).
   Anthurium x selloanum is an endemic hybrid to BVI and USVI with a very restricted extent of occurrence which was estimated to range between 103 km and 207 km(2) and an area of occupancy which was estimated to range between 56 km and 188 km(2) and a limited number of locations. The suitable habitat of this species is declining mainly due to the negative impacts of feral ungulates, development for tourism and residential infrastructure and the negative impact of recreation activities in protected areas. This species is therefore evaluated as Endangered, based on IUCN Red List Criteria B1a+ b(iii) + B2a+b(iii).
   Coccoloba krugii x C. uvifera is native to the BVI, USVI, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Haiti and Anguilla. It is estimated to have an extent of occurrence of 89,412 km. This value exceeds the threshold for any threatened category. Despite an observed continuing decline of suitable habitat for this species, which is being degraded mainly through ongoing development pressures, this species occurs in more than 10 locations. It is therefore assessed as Least Concern (LC).
   New information
   In this paper, we discuss the conservation status of all the known, naturally occurring, native hybrids in the the British Virgin Islands and we provide distribution data, including new records, from across these hybrid species ranges. Although conservation assessments of hybrids are out of the scope of the published IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee 2019), we use the IUCN Red List Criteria and Categories (version 3.1) to establish an equivalent conservation status of these hybrids and discuss conservation action due to the potential evolutionary importance of these naturally occurring hybrids. These assessments provide the necessary baseline information for prioritising species conservation and making informed management decisions, such as establishing the BVI's Tropical Important Plant Areas (TIPAS) network (Sanchez et al. 2019).

AB  - Aims Legacy effects arising from grazing may alter the effect of plant-soil feedback (PSF), plant-phyllosphere feedback (PPF) and/or transgenerational plasticity on plant performance. Understanding how effects from these mechanisms are influenced by grazing can help predict grassland production and ecosystem dynamics.
   Methods Plant clonal buds and shoot materials of Leymus chinensis (a clonal grass species widely distributed across the eastern Eurasian Steppes), sterilised and non-sterilised soils were collected from sites subjected to long-term grazing or no grazing. We then conducted a series of studies to determine the presence and context-dependency of (1) PSF, (2) PPF and (3) clonal transgenerational plasticity mechanisms on long-term grazing by measuring plant above/belowground biomass, height and density.
   Results Inoculation with soil biota conditioned by L. chinensis from grazed sites increased root growth by 83.99% (positive PSF), but not inoculum from ungrazed sites (neutral PSF). Shoot inocula from grazed and ungrazed sites had similar positive effects on plant growth (positive PPF). Clonal offspring from grazed sites showed transgenerational trait plasticity in terms of herbivory-avoidance (21.24% height reduction and 84.62% tiller density increase), but aboveground production was unaffected. Additionally, grazed field plots with a year of grazing exclusion showed similar plant heights and aboveground biomass as ungrazed plots, which indicated short-term transgenerational trait plasticity.
   Conclusions Positive PSF and short-term clonal transgenerational plasticity of L. chinensis depended on past grazing activity, and together with positive PPF, can aid their recovery and fitness in subsequent growing seasons. Our findings highlighted context-dependent plant-microorganism interactions and trans-generational feedback of plants in response to grazing.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a widespread infectious disease that is currently a major cause of economic losses in pig production. In Hungary, a National PRRS Eradication Program has been introduced to attain a more efficient, economic, and competitive international market position. The program has been also approved by the EU, but the resulting legal obligations have imposed a burden on Hungarian producers to comply with EU competition rules. The implementation of the program has been carried out by the veterinary authorities with the consent of, continuous support from and monitoring conducted by organisations within the pig sector as well as a scientific committee. The PRRS eradication program in Hungary was based on a regional territorial principle and was compulsory for all pig holdings within the regions. In Hungary, large fattening farms operate as all-in/all-out or continuous flow systems. Large-scale breeding herds are predominantly farrow-to-finish types. Although its significance has decreased in recent decades, 20% of the Hungarian pig population is still kept on small (backyard) farms (<100 animals). All PRRSV-infected large-scale farms had to develop a unit-adapted eradication plan, including external and internal biosecurity measures, vaccinations, etc. It was crucial to render each fattening unit free of the disease, as fattening units play a significant role in spreading the virus within the country. The eradication efforts mainly implemented were depopulation-repopulation methods, but on some farms a testing and removal method has been used. As the eradication progressed over the years, the introduction of infected fattening pigs was restricted. Thanks to these measures, Hungarian large-scale fattening farms became PRRSV-free by the end of 2018. The PRRSV-free status of small-scale herds was achieved by the end of 2015 and was maintained between 2016 and 2021. By 31 December 2021, all breeding pigs in large-scale farms in Hungary were free of wild-type PRRS virus. By 31 March 2022, the total pig population of the country, including all backyard farms and fattening units, achieved PRRSV-free status. The future goal is to ensure and maintain the PRRSV-free status of Hungary via strict import regulations of live animals combined with the continuous and thorough screening of incoming and resident herds for the presence of the virus.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effect of Moringa oleifera leaf extract on semen quality parameters in Teressa goat buck. Methods: A total of 25 semen samples from six bucks were selected for the study. Spermatozoa of 150x 10(6) were incubated in 0, 300, 500 and 700 mu g of leaf extract as group I, II, III and IV, respectively. Liquid stored semen samples were analysed for motility, viability, total sperm abnormalities, plasma membrane, acrosomal and nuclear integrities, seminal plasma intracellular enzymes [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and spermatozoa malondialdehyde (MDA) and cholesterol efflux in comparison with the control group (group I) for up to 72 h. Results: Moringa oleifera leaf extract (500 mu g/150x 10(6) spermatozoa)-treated semen had significantly higher motility, viability, plasma membrane, acrosomal and nuclear integrities, and TAC (P<0.05), and had significantly lower total sperm abnormalities, AST, ALT, LDH, MDA production and cholesterol efflux compared to those in other Moringa oleifera leaf extract treated (300 or 700 mu g/150x10(6) spermatozoa) and control groups at different hours of liquid storage (P<0.05). Semen quality parameters and TAC showed an increasing trend and total sperm abnormalities, MDA production, leakage of intra-cellular enzymes and cholesterol efflux showed a decreasing trend from group I to group III and then an opposite trend from group II to group IV at different hours of liquid storage. Conclusions: Moringa oleifera leaf extract 500 mu g/150x10(6) spermatozoa can be used for liquid semen preservation in Teressa goat at Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

AB  - Two leading factors that deteriorate environmental conditions and well-being are urban heat island (UHI) as a micro-climatic phenomenon and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration as the most critical greenhouse gasses. The aim of this study is to enhance outdoor thermal comfort (OTC), UHI, and CO2 concentration in a polluted and heated area with a high potential for promoting a sustainable culture. For this purpose, several sustainable solutions were evaluated, including cool roofs (CR), green roofs (GR), cool pavements (CP), vegetation greenness (VG), and total alternative (TA). Initially, the strategies were investigated individually, and later collectively in one part of the study area, and then expanded to the whole site for more assurance. The research results were extracted by ENVI-met (4.5.6) and then field measurements and another software's result, namely Element, Rhino and Grasshopper. According to the results, the VG scenario is the most effective strategy to improve OTC indices and CO2 concentration. Moreover, the CP scenario, with permeability, has the most crucial role in UHI mitigation, especially the nocturnal one; it is important to note that no study in the Middle East has been able to improve nocturnal and diurnal UHI simultaneously. Field measurements and another software's result validate our findings. Studied thermal comfort indices have the highest correlation with mean radiant temperature, followed by air temperature and CO2 concentration. Thus, this study provides a new perspective to appraise the effectiveness of CO2 concentration as an essential factor in this field and practicable solutions for designers.

AB  - Understanding how management influences forage nutritive value and grazer selection within grazing seasons is an ongoing effort for researchers and land managers globally. We used six, 65 ha pastures managed with patchburn grazing and stocked with either cow-calf pairs (0.45-0.5 ha center dot AUM-1) or gestating ewes (0.4-0.48 ha center dot AUM-1) to explore how patterns in rangeland forage drive grazer selection in semi-arid rangeland over four summer grazing seasons at monthly intervals. We used near-infrared spectroscopy to determine nutritive value parameters from monthly forage clippings. We evaluated livestock performance as the average daily weight gains of each animal. We used mixed-effect models and ordination to compare patch and grazer types across the timesince-fire gradient and found that time-since-fire was significant for all measured variables. Cattle and sheep consistently preferred recently burned patches throughout grazing seasons. These recently burned patches typically contained available forage with higher crude protein and moisture content, lower biomass, and lower acid detergent fiber, acid detergent lignin, and neutral detergent fiber compared to intermediate time since fire patches and patches burned three years ago. Differences between patch-burn grazing with cattle and sheep were observed as additional patch contrasts for available biomass and crude protein, but grazer type and ecological site were not statistically significant factors for the nutritive value ordination. Our study indicates that patchburn grazing is capable of imposing and maintaining heterogeneous, grazer selection, forage biomass, and nutritive value patterns desirable for heterogeneity focused land management, regardless of grazer type. These findings are especially relevant to the northern Great Plains where introduced grasses are homogenizing the structural environment of remaining rangelands. With prescribed fire currently an uncommon practice throughout the region, these findings provide a baseline of expectations for practitioners and land managers implementing patch-burn grazing and illustrate how grazing livestock can benefit from the patch contrast in forage nutritive value and biomass.

AB  - Managers of threatened species in remote protected areas play a pivotal role in shaping the outcomes of management and conservation programmes. The island of Java supports the last remaining population of the Javan rhinoceros Rhinoceros sondaicus, a Critically Endangered megaherbivore with only 72 individuals persisting in the wild, in Ujung Kulon National Park. Substantial resources are being invested to manage the Javan rhinoceros and it is difficult to monitor it in the rainforest to assess whether management actions have been successful. Insights from frontline staff into the outcomes of past conservation actions and the future actions required may be key to enhancing the outcomes of conservation actions for threatened species. To study the perceptions of frontline staff towards the conservation of the Javan rhinoceros, management actions and their outcomes, we surveyed all 36-frontline staff in Ujung Kulon National Park. Although staff perceptions of conservation outcomes were generally positive, they noted key anthropogenic threats and challenges to rhinoceros protection inherent to the survival of the last Javan rhinoceros population. Staff identified increased threat of disease transfer from domestic stock to the rhinoceros, in spite of protective fencing, and the combined effects of illegal firewood collection and agricultural encroachment on rhinoceros habitat. Systematically recording and incorporating the perceptions of frontline staff in remote and often inaccessible protected areas can help identify important areas for future conservation and threat mitigation that can facilitate better protection for the Javan rhinoceros and other iconic species.

AB  - Biological control methods may provide efficient and environmentally sustainable methods for curbing invasive weeds. Miconia calvescens DC (Melastomataceae) is an invasive weed of forest ecosystems on oceanic islands and one of the most invasive alien species. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify and assess the population dynamics of herbivorous insects that feed on M. calvescens in Brazil. The following species were found on M. calvescens plants at our three study locations: Apion sp. (Brentidae), Agrilus sp. (Buprestidae), Cryptorhynchus sp., Naupactus spp. (Curculionidae), Brasilaphthona sp., Cerotoma sp., Chrysodina sp., Colaspis sp., Diabrotica speciosa, and one unidentified species of the subfamily Cassidinae (Chrysomelidae). According to host specificity and impact caused to M. calvescens, the fruit-feeding Apion sp. and the stem-boring Cryptorhynchus sp. have high potential for this weed's biological control. Thus, our results provide useful information for potential biological control programmes for M. calvescens using herbivorous insects and will be helpful for companies working on natural weed control for this species.

AB  - Physiological and hematological traits and productive performance of Spanish Majorera and Palmera goats reared on the Island of Tenerife-Spain were assessed. 50 adult, clinically healthy, multiparous female goats were studied for 18 months. The data were analyzed in a two (breeds) x four (season) factorial scheme. Multivariate analysis and machine learning were used to assess the relationship between adaptive responses and climatic variables. There was no interaction effect between season of the year and breed for physiological responses (P > 0.05), except for coat surface temperature (P < 0.001). Respiratory rate and rectal temperature had no effect on breed c unlike heart rate and coat surface temperature. All thermoregulatory variables showed variations between seasons. The goats had a higher respiratory rate (P < 0.001) in summer and autumn. Rectal temperature was higher in spring (P < 0.001), but similar to winter (P > 0.05), whereas the heart rate was higher by 16.67% in winter when compared to other seasons (P < 0.001). The surface temperature of the coat presented higher values for the Majorera breed when compared to the Palmera in summer and spring. The Majorera breed showed greater productive performance (body weight; P < 0.05). In winter, the red blood series of Majorera goats showed higher values for hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (P < 0.05). The white blood series is similar between breeds (P > 0.05). There is a dynamic in the adaptive mechanisms used by Majorera and Palmera goats during the seasons. The temperate climate on Tenerife Island has a greater impact on Majorera goats (r2 canonical = 0.76; P < 0.001) when compared to Palmera goats (P = 0.68; P < 0.001). The surface temperature of the coat is the first activated thermoregulatory mechanism for both breeds (P < 0.001). However, only Majorera goats presented secondary mechanisms which are related to heart rate for lower coat surface temperature values, possibly due to vasoconstriction in winter; and for higher values of rectal temperature when the surface temperature of the coat increases in summer. It is concluded that both breeds are adapted to the temperate climatic conditions of the Island of Tenerife, but there is a seasonal adaptive dynamic. Majorera breed animals have greater body weight, but are less tolerant to the Island's climate. In the warmer seasons, these animals increase the surface temperature of the coat to dissipate endogenous heat and in the colder seasons they increase the number of red cells, which demonstrates their adaptability to the winter climate on the Island of Tenerife.

AB  - The Aransas-Wood Buffalo population (the only non-reintroduced, migratory population) of endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana) overwinters along the Texas Gulf Coast, USA. Understanding whooping crane space use on the wintering grounds reveals essential aspects of this species' ecology, which subsequently assists with conservation. Using global positioning system telemetry data from marked whooping cranes during 2009-2017, we fit continuous-time stochastic process models to describe movement and home range using autocorrelated kernel density estimation (AKDE) and explored variation in home range size in relation to age, sex, reproductive status, and drought conditions. We used the Bhattacharyya coefficient of overlap and distance between home range centroids to quantify site fidelity. We examined the effects of time between winter home ranges and the sex of the crane on site fidelity using Bayesian mixed-effects beta regression. Winter whooping crane 95% AKDE home range size averaged 30.1 +/- 45.2 (SD) km(2) (median = 14.3, range = 1.1-308.6). Home ranges of sub-adult females were approximately 2 times larger than those of sub-adult males or families. As drought worsened, home ranges typically expanded. Between consecutive years, the home ranges of an adult crane exhibited 68 +/- 31% overlap (site fidelity), but fidelity to winter sites declined in subsequent winters. The overlap of adult home ranges with the nearest unrelated family averaged 33 +/- 28%. As a whooping crane aged, overlap with its winter home range as a juvenile declined, regardless of sex. By 4 years of age, a whooping crane had approximately 14 +/- 28% overlap with its juvenile winter home range. Limited evidence suggested male whooping cranes return to within 2 km of their juvenile home range by their fifth winter. Previous data obtained from aerial surveys led ecologists to assume that whooping crane families normally used small areas (similar to 2 km(2)) and expressed persistent site fidelity. Our analyses showed <8% of families had home ranges <= 2 km(2), with the average area 15 times greater, and waning site fidelity over time. Our work represents an analysis of whooping crane home ranges for this population, identifying past misconceptions of winter space use and resulting in better estimates of space requirements for future conservation efforts.

AB  - Megaherbivore carcasses represent sporadic but energetically rewarding resources for carnivores, offering a unique opportunity to study coexistence dynamics between facultative scavengers. South African fenced protected areas, such as Madikwe Game Reserve (Madikwe hereafter), host viable populations of large carnivores and high densities of elephants, Loxodonta africana. However, high carnivore densities can lead to potentially fatal interspecific encounters and increased competition, particularly around high-quality trophic resources. This study explores the temporal partitioning and co-detection strategies of carnivores at six elephant carcasses in Madikwe, aiming to understand how the increased carrion biomass available at elephant carcasses influences coexistence dynamics. Camera traps were deployed to monitor carcasses during two periods (2019 and 2020), revealing occurrences of six carnivore species. Carnivores, particularly black-backed jackals, Lupulella mesomelas, (hereafter jackal), lions, Panthera leo, and spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, comprised 56.7% of carcass observations, highlighting their pivotal roles in scavenging dynamics. Pairwise co-detection analysis demonstrated consistent association and shared peak activity periods between jackals and spotted hyaenas, indicating potential resource sharing. However, the minimal co-detection rates between lions and other carnivores highlight their resource domination. There was some evidence of temporal partitioning between carnivores, with most species exhibiting earlier peaks in nocturnal activity to avoid temporal overlap with lions. This study emphasises the importance of elephant carcasses in the diet of multiple species and coexistence techniques utilised to exploit this ephemeral resource. As fenced protected areas become crucial for conserving intact carnivore guilds globally, further research into carnivore behavioural adaptations at carcasses is recommended to shed light on their coexistence strategies.
   Megaherbivore carcasses represent sporadic but energetically rewarding resources for carnivores and it is poorly understood how these carrion resources impact interspecific interactions. We studied elephant carcasses in Madikwe Game Reserve, South Africa, to investigate temporal partitioning and co-occurrence between the carnivore guild. Co-occurrence was high between some carnivores, suggesting aggressive interactions may be reduced by abundant food resources.image

AB  - In 2019, there was an environmental catastrophe in Brazil, when more than 5000 tons of unknown origin crude oil invaded beaches and mangroves. Two years later, two monitoring areas were selected to study seahorses' offspring: Massangana River estuary (apparently healthy area) and Cocaia Island (affected area). Thirty-six reproductive events of Hippocampus reidi (Syngnathidae) couples from these two areas were monitored to analyze the offspring. At the apparently healthy area, no newborns with malformations were found. However, the offspring from Cocaia Island showed a mean of 19.73% (+/- 5.23) malformations in newborns. It is argued that the toxic/teratogenic effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have affected the population in two ways: directly through the induction of mutations in the germ cells of the species and through a drastic reduction of the population (bottleneck effect) whose density observed today recovered through consanguineous couplings, potentiating deleterious genotypes in the offspring.

AB  - Seagrasses provide valuable ecosystem services, including improved water quality, carbon sequestration, and sediment stabilization. Unfortunately, these critical habitats are declining globally due to a range of anthropogenic impacts. Restoration practitioners have made efforts to mitigate loss through the introduction of seagrass transplants. However, seagrass restoration has low success rates and is plagued by water quality concerns and ecosystem degradation. Studies to improve seagrass restoration efforts have targeted different functional taxa to allow for greater stability and recovery of threatened ecosystems, and excluded macro-grazers to limit losses to newly established and restored seagrasses. We hypothesized greater seagrass (Halodule wrightii) health when restored in conjunction with hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) and protected from grazers using herbivore exclusion devices (HEDs) in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida. While our study experienced high rates of seagrass mortality, we were able to observe significant differences in seagrass health between IRL sub-lagoons and observed the positive effects of HEDs on seagrass health. The observed high species mortality highlights how restoration in the IRL is hindered by biotic and abiotic stressors, site selection, and a lack of clear restoration protocols. As we see ongoing declines in water quality and loss of foundational species, informed site selection, greater understanding of grazer presence, and multi-species restoration will provide an informed approach for future seagrass restoration projects globally.

AB  - Introduction Monitoring bycatch of protected species is a fisheries management priority. In practice, protected species bycatch is difficult to precisely or accurately estimate with commonly used ratio estimators or parametric, linear model-based methods. Machine-learning algorithms have been proposed as means of overcoming some of the analytical hurdles in estimating protected species bycatch.Methods Using 17 years of set-specific bycatch data derived from 100% observer coverage of the Hawaii shallow-set longline fishery and 25 aligned environmental predictors, we evaluated a new approach for protected species bycatch estimation using Ensemble Random Forests (ERFs). We tested the ability of ERFs to predict interactions with five protected species with varying levels of bycatch in the fishery and methods for correcting these predictions using Type I and Type II error rates from the training data. We also assessed the amount of training data needed to inform a ERF approach by mimicking the sequential addition of new data in each subsequent fishing year.Results We showed that ERF bycatch estimation was most effective for species with greater than 2% interaction rates and error correction improved bycatch estimates for all species but introduced a tendency to regress estimates towards mean rates in the training data. Training data needs differed among species but those above 2% interaction rates required 7-12 years of bycatch data.Discussion Our machine learning approach can improve bycatch estimates for rare species but comparisons are needed to other approaches to assess which methods perform best for hyperrare species.

AB  - Simple Summary Heterozygosity-rich regions (HRRs) are regions of high heterozygosity, which can harbor important genes associated with key functional traits such as immune response and disease resilience. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are contiguous homozygous segments of the genome, which can be informative of the population's history, structure, demography events, and overall genetic diversity. We first detected factors impacting the identification of ROH and HRR in worldwide sheep populations, which were artificially selected for specific purposes or under natural conditions. We also identified common regions of high homozygosity or heterozygosity among these populations, where a diversity of candidate genes with distinct functions might indicate differential selection pressure on these regions in breeds with different trait expression. Moreover, we evaluated a tool commonly used in the corporate environment, making use of the business intelligence (BI) concept to support managers in the decision-making process, which allowed us to combine results from multiple analyses and create visualization schemes integrating different information. Our findings and proposed tools contribute to the development of more efficient breeding strategies and conservation of genetic resources in sheep and other livestock species. In this study, we chose 17 worldwide sheep populations of eight breeds, which were intensively selected for different purposes (meat, milk, or wool), or locally-adapted breeds, in order to identify and characterize factors impacting the detection of runs of homozygosity (ROH) and heterozygosity-rich regions (HRRs) in sheep. We also applied a business intelligence (BI) tool to integrate and visualize outputs from complementary analyses. We observed a prevalence of short ROH, and a clear distinction between the ROH profiles across populations. The visualizations showed a fragmentation of medium and long ROH segments. Furthermore, we tested different scenarios for the detection of HRR and evaluated the impact of the detection parameters used. Our findings suggest that HRRs are small and frequent in the sheep genome; however, further studies with higher density SNP chips and different detection methods are suggested for future research. We also defined ROH and HRR islands and identified common regions across the populations, where genes related to a variety of traits were reported, such as body size, muscle development, and brain functions. These results indicate that such regions are associated with many traits, and thus were under selective pressure in sheep breeds raised for different purposes. Interestingly, many candidate genes detected within the HRR islands were associated with brain integrity. We also observed a strong association of high linkage disequilibrium pattern with ROH compared with HRR, despite the fact that many regions in linkage disequilibrium were not located in ROH regions.

AB  - Knowledge about the factors affecting the number of active latrines (NAL) of reintroduced Cuvier's gazelles (Gazella cuvieri Ogilby, 1841) is of a crucial step aiming at understanding their distributional dynamics and their habitats preference. Here, we used six random 500-m transects to assess the effect of season, microhabitat, and management variables on the spatio-temporal pattern of latrines in the Tergou forest reserve (TFR). Our results showed that, in this reserve, NAL is mainly governed by the interaction between season and distance to the nearest developed runway, being higher at the farthest distances from the runway in autumn and the closest distances to it in summer and winter. Variation partitioning analysis confirmed this pattern as the interaction between season and distance to the nearest developed runway explains 82% (p = 0.001) of the total variance in NAL. The distance to the nearest fence also contributes, but marginally, in influencing the NAL in this forest enclosure. For the species' management and conservation, it is recommended to dispose of sandy open ground areas especially in forest reserves to ensure ideal conditions for reintroduced gazelles. The pursuit of monitoring is necessary to understand mechanisms governing the distributional dynamics of Cuvier's gazelles more deeply. As any enclosure, the TFR would offer a good opportunity for consolidating and improving the knowledge on this vulnerable mammal species in the view of a successful release in the wild.

AB  - The population size of capercaille Tetrao urogallus in Scotland was estimated from annual counts of males at 151 known spring lek sites and 45 counts of males, females and their broods in August during the period 2010-2020, combined with published survival estimates. Population size declined from an estimated 580 birds (95% CL: 462-698) in 2011 to 304 (239-369) in 2020 and the extinction probability was 23% after 25 years, 95% after 50 years and 100% after 100 years. Removing mortality associated with collisions against fences lowered extinction probabilities to 0, 3 and 40% respectively, emphasizing fence removal as a management priority. Greatest declines occurred in Deeside and Donside, Morayshire and Ross-shire and Perthshire and Trossachs. In the Badenoch and Strathspey stronghold, where an estimated 83% of males remain, numbers of occupied leks and lekking males have decreased in the last five years and are associated with reduced breeding success over the last 10 years. Our estimates of population size are only half that derived from the last official national survey in winter 2015/2016. We discuss possible reasons for this difference including underestimates from lek-based surveys linked to male detection probabilities. Finally, we recommend improvements to the current annual monitoring scheme, including repeat counts at leks and use of novel remote acoustic devices and restoration of annual brood counts in remaining key forests.

AB  - The flax weevil Anagotus fairburni is a large flightless beetle, that is one of the members of the endemic insect 'megafauna' of New Zealand. It is a protected species that currently persists only on predator-free islands or in remote and difficult to access alpine areas. Little is documented about the ecology of the flax weevil. In this study we estimated the number of instars in the A. fairburni life cycle by measuring the head capsule widths of larvae collected in the field on Mana Island Scientific Reserve. We used kernel density function estimates to predict average head-capsule widths and the number of larval instars. We then used Brooks-Dyar's law on the head capsule width data and analysed Brooks and Crosby indexes to refine the estimated number of instars based on imperfect data. Results from sampling of 86 larvae suggested four instar groupings, but further analysis based on Brooks-Dyar's law found that A. fairburni likely passes through 6 or 7 larval stages prior to pupation, with some uncertainty for smaller instars. Our method provides new data on ecology of an endemic species and provides a framework for further work on similar endangered species where data is imperfect or difficult to gather.

AB  - Silvopastoral systems (SPS) are strategic in neutralizing greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in livestock production systems, particularly in the tropics. This research assessed the mitigation potential of SPS on the carbon footprint (CFP) neutralizing in one integrated livestock farm of cow-calf and pig production system in the Colombian Amazon. Annual carbon accumulation rate (ACAR) in MgCO(2)e ha(-1)y(-1), was evaluated on living above-ground biomass including trees and shrubs > 2 cm DBH and pasture, and leaf litter and below-ground biomass including coarse and fine roots, soil organic carbon 0-10 cm deep, and total ACAR adding up all components in live fences (LF), scattered trees (ST), fallows (FW), fodder bank (FB) and pastures (PT). The GHG emissions in MgCO(2)e ha(-1)y(-1) were accounted in CO2 from liming, urea, fuel, electricity, and supplementation, CH4 from enteric methane, manure, and organic fertilization and N2O from urine and manure. The C balance was obtained from the differences between ACAR of SPS on farm and the CFP per surface. Mean total ACAR expressed in MgC ha(-1)y(-1) were 9.0 +/- 4.6 in FW, 7.0 +/- 1.2 in LF, 5.5 +/- 0.8 in ST, 4.2 +/- 0.2 in FB and 2.9 +/- 0.1 in PT. Mean CFP was 3.7 MgCO(2)e ha(-1)y(-1), 5.3 MgCO(2)e Live Weight ha(-1)y(-1), and 23.6 MgCO(2)e Live Weight Gain y(-1). The CFP (area) can be neutralized with total ACAR value of 2.1 ha(-1) for LF, 1.6 ha(-1) for FW, 2.6 ha(-1) for ST, 3.5 ha(-1) for FB and 5.1 ha(-1) for PT. The Silvopastoral systems have a higher potential for neutralizing GHG emissions than pasture-based scenario when considering the ACAR in above-ground biomass.

AB  - A partial mitochondrial DNA Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) gene haplotype variant of the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) Oryctes rhinoceros, classed as 'CRB-G (clade I)', has been the focus of much research since 2007, with reports of invasions into new Pacific Island locations (e.g., Guam, Hawaii, Solomons Islands). For numerous invasive species, inference of invasion biology via whole genome is superior to assessments via the partial mtCOI gene. Here, we explore CRB draft mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from historical and recent collections, with assessment focused on individuals associated within the CRB-G (clade I) classification. We found that all Guam CRB individuals possessed the same mitogenome across all 13 protein-coding genes and differed from individuals collected elsewhere, including 'non-Guam' individuals designated as CRB-G (clade I) by partial mtCOI assessment. Two alternative ATP6 and COIII partial gene primer sets were developed to enable distinction between CRB individuals from Guam that classed within the CRB-G (clade I) haplotype grouping and CRB-G (Clade I) individuals collected elsewhere. Phylogenetic analyses based on concatenated ATP6-COIII genes showed that only Guam CRB-G (clade I) individuals clustered together, and therefore Guam was not the source of the CRB that invaded the other locations in the Pacific assessed in this study. The use of the mtCOI and/or mtCOIII genes for initial molecular diagnosis of CRB remained crucial, and assessment of more native CRB populations will further advance our ability to identify the provenance of CRB invasions being reported within the Pacific and elsewhere.

AB  - Marine shrimps of the genus Thor Kingsley, 1878 are distributed in the eastern and western Atlantic, eastern Pacific, and Indo-West Pacific. Thor manningi Chace, 1972 was originally described from Antigua and since then has been recorded from other Atlantic localities, including the Caribbean Sea, Bermuda, USA, Brazil, and Ascension Island. Specimens previously identified as T. manningi from Panama and Brazil were analyzed using a combination of morphological and molecular approaches. The analyses yielded a new species from the Atlantic coast of Panama, herein described as Thor paulae sp. nov. Moreover, we provide additional morphological observations on T. manningi, mainly regarding mouthparts and pereopods. The new species is morphologically similar to the Pacific Thor cocoensis Wicksten and Vargas, 2001 and Thor marguitae Bruce, 1978. However, it can be separated from them by the carpus of the second pereopod, rostral dorsal dentition, and chela of the first pereopod, respectively. The two species studied here can be easily distinguished by the supraorbital prominence in T. manningi (versus absent in the new species), and the pterygostomial margin rounded and unarmed in T. manningi (versus angular, with tooth in the new species). Thor manningi is morphologically closer to the western Atlantic Thor dobkini Chace, 1972 and Thor floridanus Kingsley, 1878, but can be separated from both by the merus of the first pereopod (T. dobkini) and dactylus of fourth and fifth pereopods (T. floridanus, but with the possibility of overlap). We provide a comparative table with morphological characters of all 17 valid species of Thor, as well as a worldwide identification key to the genus.

AB  - One of the most conspicuous marks of the Anthropocene worldwide is the ubiquitous pollution by long lifespan materials (e.g., plastic). In marine habitats, anthropogenic debris are observed from floating on the surface to deposited on the substrate or ingested by wildlife at different food web levels. However, the link between feeding strategy types and debris ingestion by reef fishes remains poorly explored. We analyzed the gut contents of three nominally herbivorous fishes along the Brazilian coast: the doctorfish Acanthurus chirurgus, the parrotfish, Sparisoma axillare, and the chub Kyphosus vaigiensis. Individual [i.e., total length (TL)] and species-level functional traits, as well sites with distinct environmental features (i.e., tourism activity intensity, fishing pressure, and distance from the coast), were tested as predictors of the concentration of debris found inside individual fish guts. Debris found were quantified, measured, and classified accordingly to color and shape. We found debris in 52.7% of individuals. Debris ranged from 0.10 to 11.75 mm, and the frequency of occurrence and ingestion rate (number of debris per individual) varied among species, being higher for the scraper species S. axillare (95.7% and 4.9 +/- 1.2, respectively) and A. chirurgus (74.6% and 1.64 +/- 0.34), than for the browser K. vaigiensis (55.8% and 0.83 +/- 0.24). TL, scraping feeding mode, and the most impacted location were positively related to debris ingestion rate. Our work revealed a higher vulnerability of an ecologically important trophic group to debris ingestion and of an already threatened species according to Brazilian red list. Besides the increasing number of species contaminated by anthropogenic debris, its effect on fish biology and physiology remains poorly understood. Understanding these links would improve conservation planning as species contamination could act as a proxy for environmental pollution on marine habitats.</p>

AB  - Soil erosion in Brazil is very high, and there is need to promote aggregate stability technics to increase the soil organic matter and the soil water infiltration, with a consequent decrease in erosion processes. Applications of animal manure on sandy loam soil may increase carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in soil aggregates, causing increased aggregate stability. This study aimed to evaluate the contents of total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) as well as the physical properties of a sandy loam soil subjected to 11 years of application animal manure and mineral fertilizer. The experiment was conducted under no-tillage (NT) system with corn (Zea mays L.)/black oat (Avena strigose Schreb.), bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)/black oat, and corn/wheat (Triticum spp.) crops. The following treatments were used: control (no fertilization), pig slurry (PS), pig deep litter (DL), cattle slurry (CS), and mineral fertilizer (NPK). Soil aggregates were obtained from undisturbed soil samples collected at soil depths of 0 to 5, 5 to 10, and 10 to 20 cm. Applications of PS, DL, and CS on soil increased TOC and TN contents, and increasing weighted mean diameter (WMD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD) in the topsoil. Use of DL and CS increased TOC at 0 to 5 cm in comparison to PS, NPK, and control. The use of animal manure also resulted in higher TN contents at 0 to 5 and 10 to 20 cm compared to control. The use of animal manure for 11 years under NT reduced the amount of mesoaggregates (2.0 > & Oslash; >= 0.25 mm) and microaggregates (& Oslash; < 0.25 mm) and increased GMD in the topsoil in comparison to the NPK and control. The animal manure promoted the dispersion of clays at 5 to 10 and 10 to 20 cm, resulting in lower soil aggregation in depth. Principal component analysis confirmed that animal manure reduced the degree of flocculation, with a consequent decrease in aggregation indexes, as it grouped the manure treatments in opposition to the NPK and control treatments.

AB  - Simple Summary Commercial orchards are amongst the most intensively sprayed crops, and alternative methods have to be found to replace pesticides. Limiting water and nitrogen (N) supply has shown to be effective in reducing aphid infestations under controlled conditions. To evaluate how far these techniques could be transferred to orchards subject to production constraints, an experiment was performed in a commercial orchard planted with two varieties differing in precocity and vigour. Limiting supplies of both water and N to trees was shown to reduce the severity of aphid infestation (green peach aphid, mealy plum aphid, and leaf curl aphid), although reducing only water supply was less effective. At shoot level, the composition and development of the infested shoots were only slightly affected by treatment, thereby indicating that aphids colonize shoots of similar condition, whose numbers are modulated by nutrition treatments. These results were consistent with variety and year. Limiting water and N supplies contributes not only to the control of aphid infestations, but also reduces nitrate leaching and the use of water, the consumption of which will inevitably need to a decrease due to climate change. However, the efficiency of aphid control could be enhanced by complementing these practices by other techniques such as adapted pruning or changes to ground cover. Peach orchards are intensively sprayed crops, and alternative methods must be found to replace pesticides. We intend here to evaluate if limiting water and nitrogen (N) supply could be effective in controlling aphid infestation in commercial orchards. N and water supply were therefore either unrestricted or restricted by 30% only for water, or for both water and N, in 2018 and 2019 on trees of two contrasting varieties. Natural infestations (green peach aphid, mealy plum aphid, leaf curl aphid) were monitored regularly at tree and shoot level. Infested and control shoots were compared for their development during the infestation period, their apex concentrations of total N, amino acids, non-structural carbohydrates, and polyphenols at infestation peak. At tree level, limiting both water and N supplies decreased the proportion of infested shoots by 30%, and the number of trees hosting the most harmful specie by 20 to 50%. Limiting only N supplies had almost no effect on infestation severity. At shoot level, the apex N concentration of infested shoots was stable (around 3.2% dry weight) and was found to be independent of treatment, variety, and year. The remaining biochemical variables were not affected by infestation status but by variety and year. Shoot development was only slightly affected by treatment. Aphids colonized the most vigorous shoots, being those with longer apical ramifications in 2018 and higher growth rates in 2019, in comparison with the controls. The differences were, respectively, 40 and 55%. It was concluded that a double restriction in water and N could limit, but not control, aphid infestations in commercial orchards.

AB  - Fish, whales, and seabirds along the productive west coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI), NE Pacific, rely on copepod prey that are assumed to be rich in lipid. However, the total lipid (TL) and fatty acid content of most copepod species and other mesozooplankton in this region have not been measured. To assess the diets and quality of zooplankton prey off the WCVI, we investigated differences in lipid content and composition of mesozooplankton according to their taxonomic versus functional group identities. Copepods, chaetognaths, euphausiids, and amphipods, belonging to 3 different functional groups, were sampled on the WCVI during pre-, mid-, and post-bloom conditions. Compared to taxonomic classifications, the functional group approach was superior in its ability to discern statistical differences in TL among zooplankton and between seasons. Furthermore, multivariate analyses using zooplankton fatty acid composition from all oceanographic regimes produced 3 to 4 statistically different clusters of species that corroborated functional group designations. However, some trophic flexibility was observed in several copepod species, particularly Calanus marshallae, that may relate to food scarcity or the presence of potentially noxious prey. The omnivorous-herbivorous functional group frequently contained higher amounts of TL and masses of essential fatty acids than the carnivorous group. Euphausiids and C. marshallae contributed the most lipid (mg m(-3)) to the pelagic 'lipid pool', due to very high lipid content and high abundance, respectively. However, on the continental slope and shelf break, chaetognaths and Neocalanus spp. copepods contributed substantially to the lipid pool.

Consequently, expeditious and efficacious oil spill detection technology is imperative for the pollution mitigation and the health preservation in the marine environment. This study proposed a marine radar oil spill detection method based on Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), and an improved Firefly Optimization Algorithm (IFA). In the stage of image pre-processing, the oil film features were significantly enhanced through three steps. The LBP features were extracted from the preprocessed image. Then, the mean filtering was used to smooth out the LBP features. Subsequently, the HOG statistical features were extracted from the filtered LBP feature map. After the feature enhancement, the oil spill regions were accurately extracted by using K-Means clustering algorithm. Next, an IFA model was used to classify oil films. Compared with traditional Firefly Optimization Algorithm (FA) algorithm, the IFA method is suitable for oil film segmentation tasks in marine radar data. The proposed method can achieve accuracy segmentation and provide a new technical path for marine oil spill monitoring.

AB  - IntroductionThroughout their range, bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) populations have seen significant disease-associated declines. Unfortunately, understanding of the underlying epidemiological processes driving the disease dynamics in this species has hindered conservation efforts aimed at improving the health and long-term viability of these populations. Individual response to pathogen exposure emerges from dynamic interactions between competing evolutionary processes within the host and pathogen. The host's adaptive immune system recognizes pathogens and mounts a defensive response. Pathogens have evolved strategies to overcome adaptive immune defenses including maintaining high genetic diversity through rapid evolution. The outcomes of this evolutionary warfare determine the success of pathogen invasion of the host and ultimately the success of conservation efforts. MethodsDuring an epizootic dominated by a single strain, we explore these host-pathogen dynamics by examining the variation in effects of pathogen invasion on captive bighorn sheep with differing histories of exposure to genetically diverse strains of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae (Movi). We monitored clinical signs of disease and sampled animals and their environment to detect spread of Movi among 37 bighorn sheep separated into nine pens based on known exposure histories. ResultsWe documented Movi transmission within and across pens and we detected Movi DNA in air, water, and invertebrate samples. Higher levels of antibody to Movi prior to the epizootic were associated with a lower likelihood of presenting clinical signs of pneumonia. Nonetheless, higher antibody levels in symptomatic individuals were associated with more severe progressive disease, increased probability and speed of pneumonia-induced mortality, and reduced likelihood of returning to a healthy state. Bighorn sheep with previous exposure to a strain other than the predominant epizootic strain were more likely to recover. DiscussionOur results indicate that Movi-strain variability was sufficient to overwhelm the adaptive host immunological defenses. This outcome indicates, in free-ranging herds, past exposure is likely insufficient to protect bighorn sheep from infection by new Movi strains, although it influences the progression of disease and recovery within the herd. Therefore, given Movi-strain variability and the lack of immunological protection from past exposure, focusing management efforts on minimizing the introduction of Movi into bighorn herds, through separation of domestic and bighorn sheep and avoidance of management activities that create commingling of bighorn sheep carrying differing Movi strains, will likely be the most effective approach for reducing the effects of disease and achieving bighorn sheep conservation goals.

AB  - This work proposes a series of strategies and tools for the design and characterization of natural treatment systems of wastewater (NTSW) applied in livestock farms, considering the parameters of flow rate (Q), conductivity (EC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the waste generated, farm location, hydraulic retention time (HRT), and removal/reduction rate targets. The high organic load of the effluent generated in these farms has an important environmental impact, which is amplified in insular or isolated territories. The application of such treatment systems has demonstrated their suitability in these environments, but their design lacks proper characterization and sizing tools for their adequate operation. The proposed tools in this work are based on a collection of experimental data over a ten-year period of application of NTSW in real farms. This work contributes to facilitate the design and implementation of NTSW in farms located in isolated, island, or similar-size environments. Finally, as a practical application, an inventory and implementation of the tool developed for livestock farms on the island of Gran Canaria (Spain) is carried out.

AB  - Bats spend more than half of their life in roosts, where key life events transpire. Therefore the availability and selection of roosts are important to bats everywhere, and may limit their ability to exploit every habitat, including agricultural landscapes such as paddy fields, orchards and tea plantations. This study aimed to investigate the day roosts used by insectivorous bat species in tea plantations of Sri Lanka. We surveyed 18 tea plantations where we recorded a total of 44 roosts involving five families and nine species of bats (Hipposideros galeritus, Hipposideros lankadiva, Hipposideros speoris, Rhinolophus beddomei, Rhinolophus rouxii, Megaderma spasma, Pipistrellus ceylonicus, Pipistrellus coromandra and Miniopterus cf. fuliginosus). Most (26) of the recorded roosts were geomorphic, (11) were anthropogenic, and (7) were in vegetation. H. lankadiva and M. cf. fuliginosus are the only species known to roost exclusively in geomorphic roosts; all others were opportunistic. Although protecting bat roosts is crucial for their conservation, it is challenging in view of existing tea management practices. Therefore, natural roosts should be maintained and protected. The introduction of artificial roosts might increase the number of bats able to forage over tea plantations and maximize their consumption of agricultural pests, thereby increasing tea production.

AB  - The discovery of the Aleurocanthus cf. Aleurocanthus spiniferus (Tea spiny whitefly spiniferus morphotype; previously found in Tokyo) for the first time in Shizuoka Prefecture raised the possibility that this species had invaded Honshu Island, Japan. Unlike the allied species, Aleurocanthus spiniferus and A. camelliae, which have been intercepted from China to Japan, the origin of the current species remains unclear. Despite the status of this species as a minor pest on the ornamental plant, Eurya japonica, the cryptic diversity among the black spiny whitefly is fascinating to be elucidated, specifically how the primary endosymbiont of whiteflies, Portiera aleyrodidarum, coevolved and contributed to the classification of whiteflies. The current study examines the taxonomic status of five species of whiteflies, i.e., A. spiniferus (Quaintance), Aleurocanthus aff. A. camelliae, Aleurocanthus cf. A. spiniferus, A. camelliae Kanmiya and Kasai, Aleurotrachelus camelliae Kuwana, and A. ishigakiensis Takahashi. Using consortium molecular typing targeting mitochondrial DNA (COI and 16S of mitoribosome), the nuclear gene (ITS1), and the ribosomal gene of Portiera, the phylogenetic clustering analysis has been conducted and revealed that the genus Aleurotrachelus sensu lato was clustered together with Aleurocanthini Takahashi, 1954 stat. rev. and reinstated Crenidorsum ishigakiensis comb. nov. due to crescent-shaped scallops being clearly defined. The current study also unveiled several putative species in the A. spiniferus species complex, molecularly. In addition, the recombination event was not detected in Portiera but has been detected in the mtCOI genes of the A. spiniferus cryptic species and the A. woglumi sequences deposited in the NCBI database. The mitochondrial recombination gives an insight into the speciation process among this species complex.

AB  - The response of plants to a warming climate could have a large feedback on further climatic change. This feedback is especially important for tropical forests, where the global peak in plant productivity and biodiversity occurs. Here we test the response of tropical forest tree seedling growth, photosynthesis and herbivory to 3 years of in situ full-soil profile warming. We studied six species, three of which are known nitrogen-fixers and we hypothesized that the warming response of growth will be mediated by nutrient availability to plants. Across species, growth was significantly lower in warmed soil compared to soil at ambient temperature, and the same pattern was observed for light-saturated photosynthesis, pointing toward a growth decline associated with decreased C fixation. Within species, the relative growth decline was significant for two species, Inga laurina and Tachigali versicolor, both of which are N-fixers. Together our results suggest a growth decline may have resulted from a negative effect of warming on N-fixation, rather than via changes in nutrient mineralization from soil organic matter, which was unchanged for N and increased for P during the dry-to-wet season transition. Overall, our study demonstrates that belowground warming causes species-specific declines in the growth and photosynthesis of seedlings, with a suggestion-requiring further investigation-that this growth decline is larger in N-fixing species.Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is necessary and urgent. This study emphasizes the critical role of One Health surveillance in monitoring AMR, integrating metagenomics to assess microbiota and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) across human, pig, and soil ecosystems in swine farms. The human and pig gut microbiota are predominantly composed of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, whereas the soil microbiota exhibits a distinct profile, with Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Planctomycetes being the most prevalent. A diverse array of ARGs is identified, including multidrug resistance, with Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria as potential ARG hosts. The study reveals shared ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) among human, pig, and soil, indicating microbial interdependence and potential for horizontal gene transfer. A positive correlation between biocide and metal resistance genes (BMRGs) and MGEs suggests the role of disinfectants and metals in ARG selection and dissemination. Network analysis of BMRGs, MGEs, and ARGs finds positive associations between copper resistance genes (corR), zinc and lead resistance genes (zraR/ hydH, zraS/hydG), and ARGs such as macB, tetA(58), mlaF, and mtrA. This correlation is also evident with insertion sequences like ISAcba1 and ISArsp9. The findings reveal the potential for horizontal gene transfer and the influence of disinfectants and metals on ARG selection and dissemination, advancing the application of metagenomic monitoring within the One Health framework. This research underscores the need for integrated strategies to mitigate antibiotic resistance and informs sustainable agricultural practices.

AB  - Animals concentrate key nutrients in their bodies. In fenced wildlife reserves where nutrient input and/or retention is low, the off-site removal of animals may constitute a significant loss of nutrients for the ecosystem.
   Here we add wildlife capture and removal into the phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca) budget for a 121,700 ha fenced game reserve located in the southern Kalahari. We then use faecal P concentrations from 11 mammal herbivores >10 kg as an indicator of potential nutrient stress in this system to investigate whether the implications of nutrient loss via off-site wildlife removal may be cause for concern. Finally, we assess the role of natural predation as a mechanism to minimise the need for wildlife removal and concomitant nutrient loss.
   During the period 2009-2018, mean loss of P and Ca via wildlife removal was 2.9 and 6.2 kg km(-2) year(-1), respectively. This compares to 1.0 and 2.1 kg km(-2) year(-1) of P and Ca added via the provision of mineral licks. If it is assumed that natural fluxes of these elements are in steady state, then anthropogenic activities have resulted in a net deficit of 18.5 kg/km(2) of P and 40.6 kg/km(2) of Ca over the decade.
   We found that dry season herbivore faecal P concentrations are close to or below a widely cited minimum threshold of 2,000 mg/kg, below which most vertebrates begin suffering growth and reproductive issues. Large animals were more likely to be under this threshold. Prolonged continuation of off-site wildlife removal may result in nutrient losses that can lead to long-term ecological degradation. Natural predation levels were, however, found sufficient to mitigate the need for wildlife removal and present a management strategy whereby herbivore populations can be regulated without a loss of nutrients.
   Synthesis and applications. We find that the capture and permanent removal of large-bodied animals from wildlife reserves can be a significant cause of nutrient loss. Over time, in sites where nutrient input and/or retention is low, this may contribute to nutritional stress for remaining resident animals. Where possible, holistic management strategies that promote the retention of animals and carcasses within the reserve-such as the reintroduction of large carnivores-should be preferred.

AB  - Ocean acidification (OA), one of the main climate-change-related stressors linked to increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, is considered an important threat to marine biodiversity and habitats. Studies on CO2-vents systems, naturally acidified environments that mimic future ocean scenarios, help to explore the sensitivity of species and to understand how benthic communities rearrange their structure and functioning under the pressure of OA. We addressed this problem by studying the benthic invertebrates associated with a habitat-forming brown alga (Cystoseira brachycarpa) in the Bottaro crater vents system off Panarea island (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy), by sampling along an OA gradient from the proximity of the main venting area (station B3, pH 7.9) to a control zone (B1 station, pH 8.1). Samples were collected in September 2016 and 2018. A total of 184 taxa and 23 different functional traits have been identified, considering feeding habit, motility, size, reproductive and developmental biology, and occurrence of calcareous structures. Invertebrates are distributed according to the distance from the high venting zone and low pH levels and results very consistent between the two investigated years. In the low-pH area (B3), 43% of the species are selected. The functional traits of the fauna mirror this zonation pattern, mainly changing the relative proportion of the number of individuals of the various functional guilds along the OA gradient. Invertebrates inhabiting the low-pH zone are mainly composed of weakly or non-calcified species, with small size, burrower/tubicolous habit, omnivorous or suspension feeders, and with direct development and brooding habit. In the other stations, heavily calcified forms, herbivore and herbivore/detritivore, and with medium (1-5 cm) and large (>5 cm) sizes prevail, showing indirect benthic and planktic development. The taxonomic analysis, coupled with functional aspects, increases our prediction of which traits could be potentially more advantageous for species to adapt to the hypothesized scenarios of OA, and identify present and future winner and/or loser organisms in the future ocean of the Anthropocene.

AB  - Despite providing important ecosystem services, termites are also serious pests of wooden structures. Termites are highly adaptive organisms that cause concern as an invasive species. Predictions of the future spread of their distribution range due to factors such as climate change, urban growth, and global trade present new challenges to our capacity to protect our wood and wood-based materials and structures effectively. Reticulitermes grassei Clement, 1978 (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae) is a subterranean termite native to the Iberian Peninsula and France, whose global distribution has widened over recent years. This article updates the distribution range of this species, confirming its identification in the Azores, Madeira, and Morocco through molecular analysis. The origin and consequences of these putative invasive populations are discussed in light of previously available data. The resulting network showed a highly structured base consisting of many haplotypes from the southern and southwestern Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal), including those from Morocco (in natural landscapes) and Switzerland (in infrastructures). The more derived part of the network includes the haplotypes from southwest France, the northwest Iberian Peninsula, the United Kingdom, Azores, and Madeira, the last 3 being linked probably to human-mediated transportation events. The potential impacts of invasive subterranean termite populations expanding into new regions are concerning, especially in urban environments, and remain uncertain in natural areas. The challenges posed by these termites could be especially worrying in island ecosystems. Hence, it is crucial to implement early warning systems and monitoring programs in regions susceptible to subterranean termite invasions.

AB  - Variation in the distribution and abundance of food resources are key factors affecting animal sociality. In environments with variable resources, dynamic social organization, such as the fission and fusion of groups, is thought to increase the benefits of group living, while reducing the costs. We investigated the relationship between social organization and prey abundance in a highly social predator, the killer whale. This was achieved by analysing 12 years (2006-2018) of seasonally delineated (coinciding with high and low prey abundances) association data obtained from nearly 90 000 identification photographs of killer whales in-shore at Marion Island in the sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean. Association network measures were compared between periods using randomized association matrices. Half-weight association index, degree, number of modules and group size were all greater during periods of high prey abundance while mean distance, centrality and modularity were lower during this same period. Results suggest that killer whales at Marion Island were more social, formed larger groups and had more associations during periods of high prey abundance. During periods of lower prey abundance, fewer interactions, stronger clustering and more division in the association network were observed. These results indicate that the social organization of this population of killer whales is seasonally dynamic, with increased sociality measures coinciding with periods of higher prey abundance. These results are similar to those of other social species, emphasizing the importance of resource abundance as a driver of social structure in animal societies.

AB  - This paper introduces and comments on the animals and plants listed in a manuscript dated 1599 (the 'Berry-Pomeroy Manuscript'), the 'Synopsis chorographical of Devonshire' by John Hooker of Exeter (1527-1601). Two hundred and seventy eight animals and plants were named, which is an unprecedented number for a local natural history text from sixteenth-century Britain. The animals mentioned include some of considerable interest like the wolf, bear, roe deer and red deer, polecat, black rat, white stork, Cornish chough and numerous freshwater fishes. Several cultivated varieties of domesticated fruit trees, in particular apples and pears, and other local specialities that are no longer known were also in Hooker's list.

FX  - I would like to gratefully acknowledge a grant from the Society for the History of Natural History's Small Research Fund in 2020 which enabled me to consult a copy of John Hooker's 'Synopsis chorographical of Devonshire', supplied by the Devon Archives and Local Studies Service. At that time I requested a copy of the Harleian manuscript, which, as mentioned, does not include the lists of animals and plants discussed here. My research into this text was stymied for some time, until Dr Quentin Deakin kindly appraised me of the fact that the 'Berry-Pomeroy Manuscript' version of the 'Synopsis' contains much more complete lists of the flora and fauna of Devon. Devon Archives and Local Studies Service was able to supply me with this alternative manuscript, and they have also generously granted me permission to publish the transcription in the Appendix. I would also like to acknowledge the energetic and knowledgeable assistance of my Westcountry family members, S. Hobbs, A. L. Raye and M. P. Allen in identifying the species of plants and varieties of fruit. M. J. Gentile once again rode to the rescue with his statistical analysis skills.

AB  - An important yet largely overlooked aspect of behavioral variation is that some individuals are consistently less "predictable" than others. Predictability is the level of variance that corresponds to (unexplained) variation among successive measurements on a given individual. Predictability can be assessed both over multiple assays and within an assay to look at short-term variation in expression of behaviors. Here, we recorded locomotor activity in a large number of wild white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) exposed to a 10-minute novel environment test. We considered short-term (seconds, minutes) variation in distance moved within a test to estimate among-individual (co)variation in intercept (personality), slope (short-term temporal plasticity), and variance within a test (predictability) at different temporal scales. Combining a multilevel reaction norm with a double hierarchical generalized linear mixed modeling approach, we found that repeatability in within-test predictability was significant, but repeatability estimates varied across the temporal scales, with estimates of R=0.36 at the shortest and longest time bins (i.e., 15 and 200 seconds) and a low estimate of R=0.11 at the 100-second time bin. The relationship between the intercept and variance of the reaction norms went from strongly positive to strongly negative from the shortest to the longest time bins. These results clearly show how the temporal scale at which predictability is studied can affect its repeatability and relationship with personality. By contrast, within-test predictability was positively correlated with plasticity across the entire range of temporal scales examined. Hence, when introduced into a novel environment, unpredictable individuals are less plastic than predictable individuals. To the extent that this correlation reflects the underlying genetic architecture of behavior, our results suggest potential constraints on the evolution of behavior across multiple levels of variation.Significance statementSome individuals are consistently less predictable than others in their behavior. Whether these individual differences in "predictability" are linked with personality and plasticity represents an important question regarding the evolution of behavior. Yet, studies considering all three levels of variance (predictability, personality, and plasticity) simultaneously remain rare. Here, we measured locomotor activity upon introduction into a novel environment in a large number of wild mice. We show that "unpredictable" mice display lower levels of phenotypic plasticity (i.e., shallower slope). The relationship between predictability and personality (i.e., individual mean differences in activity), however, depended on the temporal scale at which behavior was measured. This study represents a first step toward a better understanding of architecture of behavior across levels of variation and raises awareness to the importance of the temporal scale at which predictability is studied.

AB  - Plant-herbivore coevolutionary interactions have led to a range of plant defenses that minimize insect damage and a suite of counter adaptations that allow herbivores to feed on defended plants. Consuming plant secondary compounds results in herbivore growth and developmental costs but can have beneficial effects such as deterrence or harm of parasitoid enemies. Therefore, the role of secondary compounds on herbivore fitness must be considered in the context of the abundance and level of harm from natural enemies and the costs herbivores incur feeding on plant secondary compounds. In this study, I combined field measurements of Cotesia congregata wasp parasitism pressure with detailed measurements of the costs of plant secondary compounds across developmental stages in the herbivore host, Manduca sexta. I show that C. congregata parasitoids exert large negative selective pressures, killing 31%-57% of M. sexta larvae in the field. Manduca sexta developed fastest during instars most at risk for parasitoid oviposition but growth was slowed by consumption of plant secondary compounds. The negative effects of consuming plant secondary compounds as larvae influenced adult size traits but there were no immune, survival, or fecundity costs. These results suggest that developmental costs experienced by M. sexta herbivores consuming defensive compounds are minor in comparison to the strong negative survival pressures from abundant parasitoid enemies.

AB  - Spatial environmental heterogeneity in the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) is always mentioned but rarely quantified and included in the evaluation process. This study introduced the habitat suitability index evaluation model based on the Gini index (HSIgini) to evaluate the optimal ranges of suitable environmental factors for three typical estuarine gobies, i.e., Rhinogobius giurinus, Acentrogobius pflaumii, Odontamblyopus rubicundus, and their habitat quality. The evaluation was carried out based on field surveys conducted in the spring and summer of 2018-2020. The Lorentz curve and Gini index were used to evaluate the spatial environmental heterogeneities in the YRE. The spatial heterogeneity of environmental factors in the Yangtze Estuary ranged from 0.62 to 0.05, with the highest Gini index for salinity and the lowest for temperature. The combination of environmental factors had significant spatial effects on habitat, with temperature showing mainly seasonal effects. The study indicated that the YRE is a good habitat for gobies and that there is spatial and seasonal differentiation in the habitats of different species, greatly reducing interspecific competition. Environmental heterogeneity is important for biological processes and should be incorporated into the modeling of bio-environmental relationships in future research to provide a basis for environmental and biological conservation and management.

AB  - A stochastic SEIW brucellosis model with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is investigated. In the model, we consider some of the realities of brucellosis transmission, such as the existence of incubation period and environmental pathogen contamination, and the spread of brucellosis also in incubation period and contaminated environment. The threshold values R0e and R0s for the stochastic extinction of the disease and the existence of a stationary distribution are established. Specifically, if R-0(e) < 1, then brucellosis almost surely exponentially dies out; otherwise, if R-0(s )> 1, then brucellosis is persistent in the mean, and the model also has ergodic property and at least one stationary distribution. Furthermore, when R-0 > 1, where R0 is the basic reproduction number of the corresponding deterministic model, the specific expression of an approximate normal density function around quasi-positive equilibrium is calculated. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical results, discuss the change of R0e with the main parameters beta 1, beta 2, alpha and l and examine the relationship between R0 and R0s. The specific expression of the marginal probability density function is obtained through a numerical simulation. The numerical simulation indicates that, in the real world, environmental interference may promote the spread of brucellosis.

AB  - Simple Summary The inbreeding coefficient is relevant for managing livestock and safeguarding biodiversity, especially in small populations. Small ruminant breeders mainly rely on pedigree information, but genomics is increasingly gaining ground as a tool to face possible pedigree inaccuracies. This study investigates pedigree-based (F-PED) and genomic (F-ROH and F-GRM) inbreeding in a representative number of Italian sheep and goat populations. Indeed, even though it has been widely studied in cattle, there is still little knowledge about the relationship between these coefficients in small ruminants, which are characterized by a different population structure, often with unconnected farms. Mean inbreeding values were low, F-ROH being the highest, with breed differences due to different managements; the correlation between F-PED and F-ROH was the strongest and directly related to pedigree depth. Moreover, we estimated F-PED from F-ROH using a linear regression model. Since massive genotyping is not affordable to small ruminant breeders, it is important to understand the distinction and relationship between differently calculated inbreeding coefficients, also in view of the introduction of genomic enhanced breeding values. Our study highlights the importance of accurate pedigree information and, especially if not obtainable, of genotyping animals. Correct data contribute to mitigate inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variability. The inbreeding coefficient is an important parameter for livestock management. Small ruminant breeders and associations mainly rely on pedigree information, but genomic tools are gaining relevance, overcoming possible pedigree inconsistencies. This study investigates the relationship between pedigree-based and genomic inbreeding in two goat and four sheep dairy breeds. Pedigree and genomic data (medium-density SNPchip) were obtained for 3107 goats and 2511 sheep. We estimated pedigree depth (number of fully traced generations, FullGen) and inbreeding (F-PED), as well as two genomic inbreeding indexes, using runs of the homozygosity (F-ROH) and genomic relationship matrix (F-GRM). The correlation between the inbreeding coefficients was assessed. A linear regression model (LRM) was fitted for estimating F-PED from F-ROH. After quality control on genomic data, we retained 5085 animals. Mean inbreeding values were low, with higher F-ROH than F-PED and F-GRM. Breed differences can partially depend on different managements. The correlation between F-PED and F-ROH was the highest and directly related to pedigree depth. The best LRM was chosen for FullGen >= 4 and >= 6 for goats and sheep, respectively; after excluding animals with extreme residuals, a new refined regression equation was calculated. Since massive genotyping is not affordable to small ruminant breeders, it is important to understand the distinction and relationship between differently calculated inbreeding coefficients, also in view of the introduction of genomic enhanced breeding values. Our study highlights the importance of accurate pedigree information and, especially if not obtainable, of calculating genomic-based inbreeding coefficients. A better estimation of animals' relatedness contributes to improve animal breeding and conservation.

AB  - The fate of carbon while passing through the rocky subseafloor of the ocean has direct implications on the global carbon cycle now and over geologic time, as well as the abundance and distribution of subseafloor life. Many organic geochemical studies require larger volumes of fluids than traditional hydrothermal samplers can provide, and also require rigorous steps to be taken to prevent contamination. The Hydrothermal Organic Geochemistry (HOG) sampler is designed to collect large volume (2-9 L) fluid samples with minimal introduction of organic or microbial contamination, and to be powered and deployed in real time from a submersible. Additional design constraints include utilizing materials appropriate for sampling fluids with elevated temperatures, fitting the sampler into the space available on the submersible, and minimizing the time needed to remove samples and prepare the sampler for re-deployment between dives. It utilizes two inlets, one devoted to natural abundance geochemistry and one that can be used for samples pre-dosed with isotopic labels or preservatives. Temperature probes providing real-time data are incorporated into each inlet to facilitate positioning the intake in areas of the hottest fluid flow, thereby minimizing entrainment of ambient bottom seawater while sampling. Fluids are shunted through two main conduits by a large volume pump. Smaller ports stemming off the main conduit connect to positive displacement fluid sample chambers and in situ filters. The outlets of these chambers and filter holders are connected to a 24-port valve, which in turn is connected to a small volume pump. The HOG sampler has successfully collected over 100 high purity fluid samples and 50 in situ filters during two expeditions to deep sea hydrothermal fields.

AB  - Female northern elephant seals ( Mirounga angustirostris ) are migratory animals that form colonies along the coasts of California and the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. A recent decline in abundance has been recorded in this species Mexican distribution, which is an important reason to investigate the different ecological processes operating in these colonies. The aim of this study was to determine values of stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in pup fur as foraging maternal indicators. During the same breeding season (2015), pup fur samples were collected to investigate these foraging variations between the two major Mexican colonies-Guadalupe Island (GI) and the San Benito Archipelago (SBA). Isotopic areas were built using the 'SIBER' package in R , and a custom hierarchical Bayesian model was used to compare the values from both localities. Mean (+/- standard deviation [SD]) delta C-13 values for individuals from GI and the SBA were -16.9 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand and -17.3 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand, respectively, while delta N-15 values were 17.4 +/- 1.1%o and 16.7 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand , respectively. The difference between the posterior means indicated a high probability (P > 99%) of GI having higher stable isotope ratio values than the SBA. For the posterior SDs, there were highly probable differences (P = 100%) only for delta C-13, where GI had a higher dispersion. Such differences explained why GI presented a wider isotopic niche area than the SBA, indicating more diverse foraging habits along GI's offshore -inshore gradient. Additionally, GI showed higher delta N-15 values than the SBA. Although this could be related to a slightly higher trophic position for GI individuals, the latitudinal effects of foraging grounds with distinct isotopic baselines remain a plausible explanation for the variations in both isotope ratios, suggesting that individuals from the SBA foraged in a more northerly location than those from GI. This study provides valuable knowledge about how females from both colonies partition resources, especially regarding habitat use.

AB  - Dispersal is a key process for population persistence, particularly in fragmented landscapes. Connectivity between habitat fragments can be easily estimated by quantifying gene flow among subpopulations. However, the focus in ecological research has been on endangered species, typically excluding species that are not of current conservation concern. Consequently, our current understanding of the behaviour and persistence of many species is incomplete. A case in point is the eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), an Australian herbivore that is subjected to considerable harvesting and population control efforts. In this study, we used non-invasive genetic sampling of eastern grey kangaroos within and outside of the Mourachan Conservation Property to assess functional connectivity. In total, we genotyped 232 samples collected from 17 locations at 20 microsatellite loci. The clustering algorithm indicated the presence of two clusters, with some overlap between the groups within and outside of the reserve. This genetic assessment should be repeated in 10-15 years to observe changes in population structure and gene flow over time, monitoring the potential impact of the planned exclusion fencing around the reserve.

AB  - Heat stress will be an increasing problem for plants and pollinators. Some Romneya coulteri flowers self-shade reproductive parts with vertically oriented petals; this keeps pistils 3-8 degrees C cooler. A previous study conducted outside of the plant's native range found that self-shading flowers experienced higher seed set than flowers with petals that were experimentally forced to all be horizontal (open) or vertical (shaded). Hand-pollinated flowers had higher seed set which negated the effect of petal orientation, suggesting that insect pollination may have driven seed set. In this study, we observed insect visitors and their effects on seed set in R coulteri's native range. Plant performance was again limited by pollen such that experimentally adding outcross pollen increased seed set. Native and introduced bees showed no proclivity toward either petal orientation. However, the most common visitor, a native beetle (Lytta auriculata), was strongly biased toward approaching and ultimately accepting flowers with vertical petals that provided shade. Beetles were covered with R. coulteri pollen. Flowers bagged with only beetles for 24 h produced as many seeds as controls left open to all visitors. However, beetles also consume pollen and chew petals. Flowers with vertical petals received more beetle damage and damaged flowers produced 35% fewer seeds than those without chewed petals. Despite the potential role of beetles as pollen vectors, flowers with vertical petals did not experience higher seed production. The outcome of beetle visitation on seed set is likely context-dependent. Petals that affected microclimate were attractive to at least one potential pollinator.

AB  - The spatio-temporal delimitation of fish reproduction is essential for the appropriate management and conservation strategies in populations. Assessing this feature in Antarctic Ichthyology is particularly difficult because harsh environmental conditions limit sample collection. This study shows how physiology can contribute compelling evidence to understand reproduction in Antarctic fish using the notothenioid Lepidonotothen nudifrons as a model species. Sampling included 121 specimens caught at Potter Cove (PC), South Shetland Islands (SSI), from November to late March of 2016-2018. Gonadal macroscopic and histologic features are reported. Oocyte growth and change in testosterone and estradiol plasma levels throughout the ovarian growth of L. nudifrons adult females is provided. In March, females (n = 17) attained gonado-somatic index of 13-20% (16.73 +/- 4.20), total fecundity of 2196-4652 oocytes/female, the leading clutch oocytes measured 1.7-2.1 mm, and males (n = 5) showed spermatozoids in their testicles. The leading clutch growth was significantly associated with photoperiod, with no diameter variation until the summer solstice, when it began to grow linearly with an estimated rate of 0.01 mm/day. Testosterone and estradiol increased together with the oocyte growing throughout the analysed months, with a higher rate of increase during March. The reproductive effort data, and especially the significant plasma level increase in both sex steroids observed in March, suggest that (1) females were at a late vitellogenesis stage, just prior to the oocyte final maturation, and thus L. nudifrons spawning period might begin in March at SSI; (2) PC is likely a spawning site for L. nudifrons, which indicates that nearshore areas are spawning grounds for some notothenioids.

AB  - Objective In the eastern Canadian Arctic, the Greenland Halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides fishery has been active since the 1990s, but to date, no comprehensive examination of seabird bycatch patterns has been carried out. Incidental catch of seabirds by fisheries can be detrimental to seabird populations and can also result in the loss of time, bait, and targeted fish species for the fishery. Thus, bycatch of seabirds can have negative impacts on both conservation efforts and fisheries. We aimed to understand seabird bycatch by the Greenland Halibut fishery across seasons, across years, and associated with different types of gear, which is critical to informing potential mitigation solutions that may reduce seabird bycatch in fishing gear.Methods We compiled all available information on seabird bycatch in the eastern Canadian Arctic region (Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization Subarea 0, Divisions 0A and 0B) to assess spatial and temporal patterns of bycatch of all seabirds reported by at-sea fisheries observers from 2010 to 2019.Results We found that northern fulmars Fulmarus glacialis were the most frequently reported seabird bycatch species in the fishery, with high levels of monthly and annual variation in the number of birds reported as bycatch. Gulls and shearwaters were also reported at lower levels in the bycatch database.Conclusions Seabird bycatch by the Greenland Halibut fishery in Divisions 0A and 0B is highly variable from year to year but does not appear to be related to the level of total allowable catch. August, September, and October had the highest levels of northern fulmars reported in the bycatch records, suggesting that fulmars may be more vulnerable to being caught in the fishery during these months, although future examinations of effort data are needed to confirm this.
   This assessment of seabird bycatch in the Greenland Halibut fishery within Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization Subarea 0, Divisions 0A and 0B, is a critical step in providing the quantitative data needed to address questions relating to population-level impacts on fisheries bycatch species in the region.

AB  - Outbreaks of herbivorous insects result in serious damage to forest trees. The gall midge Schizomyiacastanopsisae (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) induces inflorescence galls and causes severe loss of acorn production for Castanopsissieboldii (Fagaceae). The outbreaks of gall midge have been occurring in these decades in the southern parts of the Izu Islands, Tokyo, Japan. In this study, we first found S.castanopsisae on Toshima Island, the Izu Islands, and in Izu Peninsula, Honshu. A genetic analysis showed that the genotype of the gall midge collected from the Izu Peninsula was identical to that from the Izu Islands, and only the haplotype was distributed in these areas. In contrast, the analysis of S.castanopsisae populations on the Nansei Islands of Japan found five haplotypes, including the one common to the Izu Peninsula and the Izu Islands. These results support the hypothesis that the gall midge populations occurring on the Izu Islands originate from the Nansei Islands, and the invaded populations have been expanding their range to the northern areas there. To monitor the distribution range and abundance of S.castanopsisae and its influences on the acorn production of C.sieboldii in Honshu are of urgent necessity.

AB  - AimPlant invasions are a global problem that requires studying plants and their environmental associations across native and introduced ranges.Location2000 km transects in China, Europe and North America.Time PeriodJune 2019-July 2020.Major Taxa StudiedJapanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica).MethodsWe surveyed 150 populations of Japanese knotweed, a noxious invader of the temperate zone, along 2000 km transects in native China and the introduced ranges of Europe and North America.ResultsWe found that larger plants and denser populations in the introduced ranges were associated with shifts in leaf economy and chemical defences. Introduced knotweed populations had higher SLA but reduced leaf chlorophyll, lignin, C:N ratio and leaf toughness along with altered leaf tannins, flavonoids and alkaloids. We found three distinct multivariate knotweed phenotypes primarily in the introduced ranges, and two multivariate knotweed phenotypes mainly in native populations.Main ConclusionsDecreased herbivore and pathogen impacts in introduced populations and changes in environmental associations indicate that enemy release and novel habitat conditions might have driven the emergence of novel ecological strategies in this global plant invader.

AB  - The natural distribution of Cycas micronesica includes three island groups. Damage to the widespread tree from the armored scale Aulacaspis yasumatsui was initiated with the 2003 invasion of Guam and the 2007 invasion of Rota. This herbivore has threatened the unique gymnosperm species with extinction. The number and identity of co-occurring consumers are dissimilar among disjunct insular subpopulations, and six of these habitats were used to assess tree mortality trends to confirm that A. yasumatsui stands alone as the greatest threat to species persistence. Following the initial infestation outbreak of this pest into each new subpopulation, the standing seedlings and saplings were the first to be culled, the juvenile plants were the next to be culled, and then the adult trees were killed more slowly thereafter. The timing of this plant population behavior did not differ among habitats with five other consumers, three other consumers, one other consumer, or no other consumers. We have shown that A. yasumatsui acting as the sole biotic threat in an isolated subpopulation can generate a decline in survival that is as rapid as when it is acting in conjunction with up to five other consequential consumers. This armored scale is the most acute threat to C. micronesica, and adding other specialist herbivores to the scale herbivory does not alter the speed and extent of initial plant mortality.

AB  - During the past 30 years, there has been a growing belief in and promotion of agroecosystem diversity for pest management and future food production as an agroecological or nature-based approach. Monoculture agriculture, which produces most of our food, is considered to be highly vulnerable to pests in contrast to plant species-diverse agroecosystems which may possess a greater abundance of natural enemies, keeping pest populations under control. In this paper, we question the role of crop diversity for pest management and explore the relationship between crop and associated diversity and pests through the following processes: environmental stresses that favor monodominance; evolutionary adaptations that resist insect herbivores (genetic resistance response); mechanisms of spatial escape from insect herbivores (escape response); and the role of crop-associated biodiversity. We present strong evidence that not only questions the high vulnerability of monocultures to pest damage but also supports why monocultures continue to produce most of the world's food. Reference is made to the importance of targeted plant breeding and the role of trans-continental crop introduction supported by efficient quarantine for pest management. We conclude that-with the exception of irrigated rice-much more research is needed to better understand the role of crop diversity in agroecosystems for pest management and food production.

AB  - Understanding the role that an environmental prion reservoir plays in the outbreak dynamics of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in free ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is critical for the allocation of disease surveillance resources by state and provincial wildlife agencies. We hypothesized that demographic, ecological, and epidemiological configurations naturally attenuate epidemic risk despite the introduction of infectious prions into a susceptible population of deer, but the magnitude of infectious prions in the environmental prion reservoir complicate outbreak expectations. We developed a Susceptible-Latent-Exposed-Infective (SLEI) compartment model to represent the dynamics of CWD epidemics in free-ranging white-tailed deer, then used the basic reproductive ratio (R0) to pinpoint counties under which pathogenic introduction (transport of infectious bodily fluids, tissues, and carcasses through natural or anthropogenic means) naturally produced (or failed to produce) an epidemic. We found that the outlook for an epidemic hinged on transmission rates, the magnitude of environmental contamination, and system type (density-, frequency-, or density/frequency-dependent). CWD can persistently infect individuals living in a contaminated environment even if direct transmission is insufficient to sustain circulation. Theoretical results show that transmission of CWD cannot be exclusively density dependent, and must behave as either a mix between frequency and density dependent, or strictly frequency dependent. While the compartment model is a simplistic representation of reality and did not contain many complicating biological considerations, it was immediately useful in hypothesis generation, motivating the collection of additional data for use in more biologically detailed models, and in the allocation of finite surveillance resources to place emphasis on data collection in areas where an introduction of infectious prions is comparatively more likely to result in an epidemic.

AB  - We examined town-level frequencies of orchid species in the southern New England states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island and their changes over time. Our analyses were based on detailed floristic studies of two Massachusetts counties, specimens in New England herbaria, and data from state Natural Heritage Programs and iNaturalist. Recent herbarium collections and data from iNaturalist proved inadequate to represent town-level occurrences in the absence of other data sources. The town-level frequencies of nearly all native orchid species have declined, and these declines were significantly greater than those of a matched group of non-orchid species of comparable historical frequency. We examined associations between orchid decline and several variables related to historical frequency, habitat affiliation, floral morphology, pollination, and geographical range. The only significant pattern was a tendency for greater declines in northern species among the state-listed species in southern New England. There was some evidence of greater declines among large-leaved orchids than small-leaved orchids and among insect-pollinated species compared to primarily autogamous species. We conclude that orchid declines are real and widespread in southern New England but that causes are unlikely to reflect a single variable. Rather, we believe that causation involves multiple factors whose effects vary among species and perhaps in different regions.

AB  - Haminoea are herbivorous, coastal snails occurring in temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific oceans, with one species present in temperate South Africa (Indian Ocean). The genus is taxonomically difficult as several available nominal species were introduced based on shell descriptions alone, or described based on subtle differences in morpho-anatomical features, without a phylogenetic molecular framework. Fifteen species are currently accepted as valid in recent scientific literature and field guides (eight Eastern Atlantic, one temperate Indian Ocean, four Western Atlantic and three Eastern Pacific). Here we generate the first complete phylogeny (Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood) of this genus based on multilocus molecular data (COI, 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, 28S rRNA) using a taxon set accumulated over a period of 15 years, coupled with species delimitation analyses methods (ABGD, ASAP, bPTP) and morpho-anatomical studies. The goal of this study is to provide insights into the taxonomy, phylogenetic relationships and geographical distributions of species while generating a framework for future systematic reviews of the genus, as well as to study speciation and historical biogeography. Our results rendered four possible hypotheses of species diversity: with 14, 15, 19 and 20 candidate species and point to the fact that several taxa presently regarded as valid might be conspecific (e.g. H. orteai-H. templadoi-H. exigua; and H. alfredensis-H. antillarum-H. orbignyana), while highlighting the existence of a complex of four or five species often identified as H. elegans. Pervasive nomenclatural problems in the genus, including with the type species H. hydatis, are highlighted and discussed.

AB  - Simple Summary New or revised techniques are being developed to improve management of expanding populations of invasive wild pigs. In southern Oklahoma, we set out to evaluate the success of various trap types: a conventional corral trap design, drop nets developed for capturing other wildlife, and recently developed suspended traps. Suspended traps removed 88.1% of the estimated population of wild pigs, whereas drop nets removed 85.7% and corral traps removed 48.5%. Suspended traps removed one pig for every 0.64 h invested in control, whereas drop nets had a 1.9 h investment per pig and corral traps had a 2.3 h investment per pig. Drop nets and suspended traps removed more of the wild pig population, mainly through whole sounder removal. The suspended trap required the least amount of time per pig removed because of real-time notifications and remote actuation from a cell phone. Drop nets and suspended traps offer greater control and time savings with the use of remote technology, making intensive, large-scale removal of pigs possible. Now, with commercially available technology, corral traps also can be configured to be user operated with real-time monitoring and trapping. Strategic control and eradication programs for wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are being developed to help curtail the expanding populations of this invasive, alien species. Drop nets and corral traps have a long history of capturing a multitude of wildlife species, so we evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of these traps for controlling wild pigs in southern Oklahoma. We also developed and evaluated a suspended metal trap that provided real-time monitoring and deployment to capture animals. Effectiveness of each trap type was estimated as the proportion of pigs removed from the total population, whereas efficiency was calculated based on catch per unit effort (CPUE) (i.e., the number of person hours per pig removal). During 3 years of study (2010-2012), we removed 601 pigs, 296 using drop nets, 60 using corral traps, and 245 using suspended traps. Suspended traps removed 88.1% of the estimated population, whereas drop nets removed 85.7% and corral traps removed 48.5%. CPUE was 0.64 person hours/pig using suspended traps followed by 1.9 person hours/pig for drop nets and 2.3 person hours/pig for corral traps. Drop nets and suspended traps were more effective at removing a large proportion of the population (>85%), mainly through whole sounder removal, but the suspended trap with real-time notifications was the most efficient trap type, requiring fewer person hours to operate.

AB  - Conservation strategies are hindered by a lack of accurate maps of important habitat for many wildlife species, but especially for species inhabiting managed forest landscapes. Prioritizing restoration efforts on Alaska's Tongass National Forest from past extensive clearcut logging is extremely challenging given the difficulty in accurately mapping its remote, rugged temperate rainforest landscapes. We tested the application of airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology to build a winter habitat model for Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis), the primary herbivore in the coastal temperate rainforest. We analyzed the importance of geomorphometric and forest structure characteristics as predictors of deer winter habitat selection using Random Forest applied to a 3-year GPS relocation dataset collected from 40 adult female deer. The LiDARbased habitat model had a predictive performance of 94% (Out-of-bag error = 6%), a 10% lower model error compared to air-photo interpreted polygons and modeled plot data. Random Forest also outperformed analogous resource selection function models based on a comprehensive k-fold cross-validation. Deer habitat selection patterns in the LiDAR-based model were nonlinear across geomorphometric and forest structure predictive variables, and generally supported existing studies of deer habitat selection. Besides improving deer conservation and management on the Tongass National Forest, our approach could greatly enhance the accuracy and resolution of habitat maps used for conservation and restoration planning across large managed forest landscapes.

AB  - Demographic data on threatened species is crucial to understand their conservation status and make management decisions when necessary, which is especially relevant for narrow endemic species with isolated populations. This is the case of Femeniasia balearica (J.J. Rodr.) Susanna, a narrow endemic cushionlike shrub that grows in coastal areas of northern Menorca (Balearic Islands, western Mediterranean Basin) and catalogued as Vulnerable according to the IUCN categories. Recently, a new population has been located in the center of the Serra de Tramuntana of Mallorca (Balearic Islands). In this study, the demographic status of the population from Mallorca has been studied, geolocating all of the individuals with a differential GPS to obtain a detailed map. Data on stage of development (seedling, vegetative or reproductive), morphometry and the overall status of all the individuals have been compiled. A total of 116 individuals and 96 seedlings have been counted. The fact that most of the individuals are reproductive (86.70%) and the confirmation of the presence of seedlings suggest that the population may be maintained in the future. This study provides valuable data on the demographic status of the new population of the species, but long-term monitoring is necessary for analyzing demographic trends.

AB  - Background and aimsHerbivore dung varies among species in terms of nutrients and microbial composition, but the effect of the microbial activity in the dung on plant growth and symbiotic association is largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the influence of cow dung quantity and dung microbial activity on plant-microbe interactions (mycorrhiza, nodulation) and the growth of Trifolium pratense seedlings.MethodsA mesocosm experiment was conducted with gradients of unsterilized or sterilized cow dung applied to pots with T. pratense seedlings. Biomass, relative growth rate (RGR), root phosphomonoesterase (PME) activity, nodulation, and root mycorrhizal colonization of the seedling were measured after 7 weeks.ResultsGrowth of T. pratense increased with increasing dung supply, while sterilization marginally decreased growth by 15-20% (P = 0.068). Root nodulation increased with increasing dung supply but was significantly lower with sterilized dung. Both root PME activity and mycorrhizal colonization decreased with increasing dung supply but were unaffected by sterilization.ConclusionsThe decreased growth and nodulation due to dung sterilization aligned with our predictions but could not be attributed to reduced dung decomposition and nutrient availability. Instead, the reduced microbial activity from sterilization likely negatively impacted bacterial N2-fixing activity and, consequently, plant growth. This suggests that herbivore dung's effect on plant growth and interactions is more complex than previously anticipated, influenced not only by nutrient supply and stoichiometry but also by microbial composition and activity.

AB  - Although large carnivores usually prefer large prey, in some situations, they may shift their predation patterns towards smaller but abundant prey. The jaguar (Panthera onca) is a large carnivore capable of changing its diet according to prey and habitat availability. Here, we assessed the temporal and spatiotemporal interactions between jaguars and their prey in the Marac & aacute;-Jipioca Islands (Northeastern Amazon, Brazil) through camera traps. We assessed overlapping activity patterns and tested for spatiotemporal segregation/avoidance between jaguars and nine potential prey species. We used a time-to-encounter approach, which consists in calculating the minimum time between prey and jaguar's detections, and vice versa, for each record of preys' species at a specific camera trap station, which translates into aggregation or avoidance behaviors. We found that these insular jaguars are more active in daylight periods when most of their prey are active and in locations used by species that cannot become nocturnal to avoid predators due to morphology constraints. Four prey species (great egret, white-tailed deer, muscovy duck, and black-and-white tegu) presented moderate activity overlapping with jaguars. Agoutis and white-tailed deer seek to spatiotemporally segregate from jaguars, although jaguars did not show spatiotemporal aggregation with any of the evaluated prey. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics is essential to establish the islands' trophic network composition and structure. This is fundamental information to efficiently allocate efforts for reducing costs and maximizing benefits in managing this population aiming to protect and conserve it, and consequently, the related ecosystems.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems, located in the land-sea interface, host a diverse array of fungi. In this paper, we introduce a novel genus, three novel species and one new record of fungi collected from mangrove environments in Pranburi, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Thailand. We establish Pseudomelanconiella as a new genus in Melanconiellaceae, to accommodate Pseudomelanconiella mangrovei, a saprobe from submerged decomposing wood of Avicennia marina. Phylogenetic analysis indicates its close relation with Septomelanconiella, but they differ in the morphology of the conidia. Additionally, our analysis of Melanconiellaceae led to the reclassification of Melanconiella loropetali to Sinodiscula loropetali and synonymizing Sinodiscula camellicola and Melanconiella camelliae. This paper also introduces two other novel species: Peroneutypa hibisci, a saprobe found on Hibiscus tiliaceus and Pseudochaetosphaeronema bruguierae from Bruguiera cylindrica, the first species in this genus reported as a mangrove fungus. A new record of Rimora mangrovei from Ceriops tagal is also reported. These discoveries emphasize the rich fungal diversity in mangrove ecosystems supporting further exploration of this unique environment.

AB  - Multi-species assemblages can help identify key resources in their habitat by evaluating how they are partitioning their resources. Here we used the isotopic niche of loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and green sea turtles to assess their ecological niche within a Gulf of Mexico bay. Additionally, we assessed temporal and size-class variation in their diets by comparing the delta 13C and delta 15N values over various capture years and size classes. Based on the isotopic niche overlap results, interspecific competition occurs among loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and smaller green turtles. Green turtle and Kemp's ridley diet varied by size class, while Kemp's ridley diet also varied temporally. The three species partition resources by selecting different preferred diet items, although some overlap in diet, including between the herbivorous (green) and carnivorous (Kemp's ridley, loggerhead) species, appears to occur. The high quality of this habitat may allow species co-existence and population recovery despite the possible use of shared resources.

AB  - We present the most recent data on the seasonal and spatial occupation of South American sea lions (Otaria flavescens) and fur seals (Arctocephalus australis) in the Wildlife Refuge of Ilha dos Lobos (WRIL) in southern Brazil throughout the year, based on aerial photographic counts. Thirty-one aerial photographic counts were conducted between July 2019 and November 2020 to assess monthly differences in the abundance of pinnipeds in the WRIL. The results were analysed using a generalized linear model. Spatial analysis was performed using kernel density. Subadult males of South American sea lion were the most abundant pinniped in the WRIL, followed by juveniles of South American fur seal. A juvenile of Southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) was also recorded. South American fur seals showed a marked seasonality, occurring only between July and October, while South American sea lions occurred year-round. Among the months analysed, September exhibited the highest mean abundance (mean 113.75; SD: & PLUSMN; 8.58), followed by August (mean 103.00; SD: & PLUSMN; 15.69). The pinnipeds were more often concentrated in the northern and central parts of the island. This study reinforces the importance of the WRIL as a haulout site for pinnipeds. Considering the seasonal occupation of the island by South American pinnipeds, monitoring is recommended prior to the development of activities in the area.

AB  - Background: South Africa is an important centre of cycad diversity in Africa, however, the country's cycads face extinction. Among the primary causes is the poaching of plants from the wild, even within protected areas.
   Objectives: This study examined poaching patterns in a local population of the Endangered Encephalartos eugene-maraisii I.Verd. and how it might affect the population structure, sex ratios, as well as interactions with associated insects.
   Methods: The population was surveyed in 2008 and 40% of this population was resurveyed between 2021 and 2022. We mapped missing cycads and generated heatmaps. Lastly, we investigated whether the proportion of stems from different size classes, sex ratios and abundance of insect associates varied between areas with a high and low poaching incidence.
   Results: Poaching, defined as the illegal removal of individuals from the wild, occurred 1.5 times more frequently along the border fence line than areas further away. Medium-sized stems (21-80 cm) are primarily targeted (likely as they can be carried more easily) and low proportions of these stems remain in areas with a high poaching incidence. While E. eugene-maraisii exhibits some resilience against poaching through basal suckering, it takes several decades for suckers to mature and replace harvested stems. No effect on sex ratios were recorded in areas with a high poaching incidence, suggesting poachers have not deliberately selected female or male cycads at this site. No pollinating insects were detected on E. eugene-maraisii, and no seedlings were observed.
   Conclusion: Cone production may be too rare in diminished populations to support pollinators that utilise cones as brood sites. The presence of insects that use other plant parts, including leaves, dried leaf stalks and cycad trunks, in the larger population suggests that they are more resilient to diminishing host populations. However, these insects were absent in smaller populations, and their abundances were lower in low-density sites and smaller clump sizes of their host in the larger population. This suggests these insects may be vulnerable to the decline of their host populations due to poaching.

AB  - The significant decline in the abundance of the Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides matsuurae in the Northwest Pacific was one of the impetuses to scrutinize the age determination methods for this species based on different age-recording structures. The present study was carried out in accordance with recommendations of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). An analysis of age determination data for the Greenland halibut has shown underestimation of age estimated using scales or whole otoliths compared to the technique using otolith sections through the peri-sulcular tuberosity. A resource exploitation strategy based on incorrect age determination can either be the major cause of negative trends in the status of the Greenland halibut stock or have a combined effect with natural factors.

AB  - Introduction: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), is an important disease in both human and animal systems. Helminths are commonly found in coinfection with MTC and TB is often exacerbated in such coinfections. Long-term anthelmintic administration, to control helminths, can improve a host's ability to control MTC infection. Mass drug administration programmes, in which anthelmintics are given only once or twice a year, leaving periods where helminth reinfection can occur, are common in both human and domestic animal populations. To date, the effect of such intermittent control programmes on MTC infection and severity has not been explored.Methods: Here we investigate the consequences of a ten-day, annual, mass ivermectin administration on TB prevalence and severity in free-ranging juvenile and yearling (<2 years) wild boar (Sus scrofa).Results: This single annual anthelmintic treatment administered over six years reduced TB severity. Further, the proportion of wild boar with severe TB continued to decrease with successive treatments. TB prevalence, however, did not decrease significantly over the course of the study.Discussion: While ivermectin has direct anti-mycobacterial effects in vitro, the short duration of treatment means that the reduction in TB severity we observe in wild boar is unlikely to be accounted for by such a direct mechanism. Disruption of the helminth community and subsequent modification or enhancement of the host immune response is a potential mechanism. Future work should examine the consequences of annual anthelmintic drug administration on helminth community composition and structure and on the host immunological responses through time.

AB  - Closely related species that have previously inhabited geographically separated ranges are hybridizing at an increasing rate due to human disruptions. These human-mediated hybrid zones can be used to study reproductive isolation between species at secondary contact, including examining locus-specific rates of introgression. Introgression is expected to be heterogenous across the genome, reflecting variation in selection. Those loci that introgress especially slowly are good candidates for being involved in reproductive isolation, while those loci that introgress quickly may be involved in adaptive introgression. In the context of conservation, policy makers are especially concerned about introduced alleles moving quickly into the background of a native or endemic species, as these alleles could replace the native alleles in the population, leading to extinction via hybridization. We applied genomic cline analyses to 44,997 SNPs to identify loci introgressing more or less when compared to the genome wide expectation in a human-mediated hybridizing population of red deer and sika in Kintyre Scotland. We found 11.4% of SNPs had cline centres that were significantly different from the genome wide expectation, and 17.6% of all SNPs had excess rates of introgression. Based on simulations, we believe that many of these markers have diverged from the genome-wide average due to drift, rather than because of selection, and we suggest that these simulations can be useful as a null distribution for future studies of genomic clines. Future work on red deer and sika could determine the policy implications of allelic-replacement due to drift rather than selection, and could use replicate, geographically distinct hybrid zones to narrow down those loci that are responding to selection.

AB  - Introduction Terrestrial species in riverine ecosystems face unique constraints leading to diverging patterns of population structure, connectivity, and disease dynamics. Desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) in Grand Canyon National Park, a large native population in the southwestern USA, offer a unique opportunity to evaluate population patterns and processes in a remote riverine system with ongoing anthropogenic impacts. We integrated non-invasive, invasive, and citizen-science methods to address questions on abundance, distribution, disease status, genetic structure, and habitat fragmentation.Methods We compiled bighorn sightings collected during river trips by park staff, commercial guides, and private citizens from 2000-2018 and captured bighorn in 2010-2016 to deploy GPS collars and test for disease. From 2011-2015, we non-invasively collected fecal samples and genotyped them at 9-16 microsatellite loci for individual identification and genetic structure. We used assignment tests to evaluate genetic structure and identify subpopulations, then estimated gene flow and recent migration to evaluate fragmentation. We used spatial capture-recapture to estimate annual population size, distribution, and trends after accounting for spatial variation in detection with a resource selection function model.Results and discussion From 2010-2018, 3,176 sightings of bighorn were reported, with sightings of 56-145 bighorn annually on formal surveys. From 2012-2016, bighorn exhibiting signs of respiratory disease were observed along the river throughout the park. Of 25 captured individuals, 56% were infected by Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae, a key respiratory pathogen, and 81% were recently exposed. Pellet sampling for population estimation from 2011-2015 yielded 1,250 genotypes and 453 individuals. We detected 6 genetic clusters that exhibited mild to moderate genetic structure (F ST 0.022-0.126). The river, distance, and likely topography restricted recent gene flow, but we detected cross-river movements in one section via genetic recaptures, no subpopulation appeared completely isolated, and genetic diversity was among the highest reported. Recolonization of one large stretch of currently empty habitat appears limited by the constrained topology of this system. Annual population estimates ranged 536-552 (95% CrI range 451-647), lamb:ewe ratios varied, and no significant population decline was detected. We provide a multi-method sampling framework useful for sampling other wildlife in remote riverine systems.

AB  - Although live prey remain essential for most marine finfish larviculture, the larvae or young juveniles are ultimately weaned onto formulated feeds at foodfish and ornamental fish hatcheries. Understanding the development of larval digestive capabilities is crucial for optimizing weaning success. The present study used the digestive system ontogeny to interpret the effects of different weaning times on larval rearing of orchid dottyback Pseudochromis fridmani, a marine ornamental fish species. The study documented the ontogenetic digestive system development of P. fridmani larvae from hatching to 40 days post-hatching (DPH). The histological analysis showed that as a demersal spawning species, the newly hatched P. fridmani larvae possessed advanced gut development which allowed the onset of exogenous feeding soon after hatching. Most major larval gut morphological changes were completed by 13 DPH; however, the stomach and gastric glands were first observed between 32 and 36 DPH. At this stage, P. fridmani larvae were expected to acquire substantially improved digestive capabilities, and were likely capable of digesting formulated feed. In the subsequent experiment, P. fridmani larvae were weaned onto formulated feed from 20, 23, 26, 29, or 32 DPH over a three-day period of co-feeding with enriched Artemia; the control group were exclusively fed enriched Artemia until the end of experiment. The timing of weaning significantly affected the larval growth and pigmentation development rather than survival (mean: 44-64%). P. fridmani larvae weaned later tended to grow larger, and the control group grew significantly larger in length than all weaning treatments (p < 0.05). Interestingly, at the end of the experiment (40 DPH), none of larvae from the control obtained adult-type pigmentation despite their larger size. In contrast, the introduction of formulated feed appeared to stimulate pigmentation development in P. fridmani individuals with a clear trend of higher pigmentation completion by 40 DPH (mean: 62-97%) with earlier weaning. Overall, this study demonstrated that P. fridmani larvae could be weaned onto formulated feed from as early as 20 DPH, before the stomach and gastric glands were fully developed; indeed, the timing of adult-type pigmentation change in P. fridmani was also advanced by the introduction of the weaning diet.

AB  - Spiny icefish (Chaenodraco wilsoni), a common high-Antarctic ichthyofauna icefish, exhibits variable feeding habits in regions around the Southern Ocean. In the Bransfield Strait (BS), C. wilsoni has received considerable attention as it preys predominantly on krill. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), the keystone species in the Southern Ocean, has a versatile feeding strategy, particularly in a highly dynamic environment. The central basin of the BS is a highly dynamic environment, providing an ideal place to explore the application of biochemical tracers in a specialist predator to reveal the diet of its prey. In this study, fatty acid and stable isotopic data demonstrated that the trophic niche of C. wilsoni expanded from late austral summer to early fall, which was primarily reflected in variability in the food availability of krill, i.e., herbivorous features were weakened, benthic-feeding features were strengthened, and omnivorous features showed no significant difference. A highly dynamic hydrography, coupled with an unusual diatom bloom in the BS during 2016, may have resulted in krill's prolonged filtering on diatoms in the water column, which was further reflected in the difference in biochemical tracers of C. wilsoni from late austral summer to early fall. The study demonstrated that biochemical tracers can be used to reflect the variability in the diet of prey, particularly in a highly dynamic environment.

AB  - In response to the present ecological crisis, new approaches to environmental conservation and management are being developed in Europe. One of the axes considered by nature protection stakeholders since the 2000s is to encourage the return of the wilderness. This has led to the deployment of a variety of initiatives, mainly led by civil and non-profit organisations. The objective here, through the analysis of the discourses of stakeholders-from semi-directive interviews-and the initiatives developed in Western Europe, is to understand how the multitude of projects carried out throughout Europe constitutes a proposal for new environmental management practices. Indeed, the studied initiatives introduce a paradigm shift by reflecting a will to go beyond the mere preservation of nature in order to contribute to a global territorial transition. To this end, the studied projects propose to create both a social and interspecies link around their sites, but also to ensure the development of virtuous economic forms in the territories.

AB  - Phytophthora ramorum is a harmful pathogen of ornamental and forest trees in Europe and North America. This pathogen has been recovered from nursery plants in Galicia (northwestern Spain) since 2003 and, despite carrying out the measures implemented by Commission Decision 2002/757/CE, including the eradication of infected plants and periodic inspections in nurseries, it is likely that P. ramorum has spread in landscaped green areas through planting of infected nursery stock. The aim of this work was to survey woody ornamental plants in public parks and gardens in Galicia for the presence of P. ramorum from 2011 to 2018 and to identify and characterize any other species of the genus found. Samples of leaves, twigs, and rhizosphere soil of symptomatic ornamental trees and shrubs were analyzed. Morphological, physiological, and molecular characteristics of 93 collect isolates enabled the identification of 13 species of Phytophthora. The greatest diversity of Phytophthora species was detected on Rhododendron and Camellia. P. ramorum was isolated from leaf samples of Camellia sp., Rhododendron sp., and Viburnum tinus grown in three sites. To our knowledge, this is the first time that P. ramorum has been detected in landscaped green areas in Spain. These results suggest that regular inspections of symptomatic ornamental woody plants are necessary to control the spread of P. ramorum and other Phytophthora species.

AB  - Understanding the spatial ecology of small populations at the periphery of their range is important for identifying factors limiting population growth and developing sound management strategies. Bighorn sheep were reintroduced to Nebraska in 1981 and persist in a small population at the easternmost extent of the distribution of the species, where 1 of the 2 subpopulations is declining. Bighorn sheep space use and movement has been studied extensively in mountain and desert populations, but information is sparse from prairie populations in the Northern Great Plains. We investigated the spatial ecology of female bighorn sheep in Nebraska, USA, with global positioning system (GPS) telemetry. We tested the hypothesis that space use and movements would vary across seasons, years, and individuals but predicted that migration would involve relatively short distances in this translocated population (relative to native populations) occupying a fragmented landscape. Overall, females used smaller seasonal home ranges (3.3-7.8 km(2)) than most of those reported previously for the species and exhibited a high degree of variability in space use and movements across seasons, subpopulations, and individuals. Most females (92-100%) exhibited fidelity to their home ranges across seasons and years. Six females migrated between spatially distinct core lambing and winter ranges, although the distances (range = 7.9-8.7 km) and mean elevations (range = 31-41 m) between these core seasonal ranges were less than those reported for most native, migratory bighorn sheep populations. After accounting for variation in season, subpopulation, and years, home range size was positively associated with road density in both subpopulations (P < 0.001), suggesting that females incur greater energetic costs associated with greater space use in areas of higher fragmentation. Our results establish the basic spatial ecology of female bighorn sheep in Nebraska where their behavior appears to reflect the isolated nature of suitable habitat in this fragmented prairie landscape.

AB  - Whilst exotic invasive species are a major threat to natural and modified ecosystems around the world, management programs to reduce their impacts often fail due to a lack of information about their biology and how best to control them in various situations. This paper reviews the currently available information on the biology, distribution, and management options for the invasive weed Senecio madagascariensis Poir. (fireweed). In addition, we developed a model to predict the climatic suitability of this weed around the world based on the current climate. Senecio madagascariensis originates from southern Africa but it has been introduced to several other countries including Australia. Climatic suitability suggests that there are large areas around the world suitable for the weed's growth where it is currently not present. The weed poses a major threat to livestock industries in these countries through its ability to reduce pasture production and poison animals. A range of control techniques have been used to try and manage S. madagascariensis. This paper highlights how a better understanding of the biology of S. madagascariensis can help determine the most effective treatments to impose and to further develop integrated management strategies. Besides using traditional approaches, the use of competitive pastures and more tolerant livestock (such as sheep and goats) are some of the other options recommended as part of an integrated approach. On-going research to identify host-specific biological control agents is also considered a priority.

AB  - Seagrasses thrive in shallow lagoons between land and fringing coral reefs, serving as a buffer that mitigates the propagation of environmental stressors from land to reefs. However, mass grazing by megaherbivores poses a significant threat to seagrass loss, impacting the sustainability of tropical coastal habitats. Despite the urgency of this issue, few studies have investigated the possible consequences of grazing on the mitigating functions of seagrass beds. To explore the roles of seagrass beds in sediment accumulation and stabilization and assess the effects of herbivory on these functions, we conducted sediment trap experiments in a coral reef lagoon to examine the impact of seagrasses on sediment mobility. Hydrodynamic forces governing sediment mobility were quantified using a customized reef-scale hydrodynamic model. The results indicated that sediment resuspension primarily driven by bottom shear stress was the primary factor influencing sediment mobility within the lagoon. Resuspension within healthy seagrass beds was generally low and exhibited minimal sensitivity to hydrodynamic forcing. Consequently, river-borne mineral soil particles predominantly remained confined within the nearshore seagrass zone due to the trapping and stabilizing effects of seagrasses. Since 2019, seagrasses have been severely depleted due to intensive grazing by sea turtles. Simultaneously, sediment resuspension has intensified, and its dependence on bottom shear stress has become evident. Our findings demonstrate that reef seagrass can effectively suppress sediment resuspension by capturing river-borne mineral soil. Furthermore, the loss of this function through mass grazing could potentially lead to sediment destabilization and erosion.

AB  - The horseshoe bats of the Rhinolophus ferrumequinum group form a well-defined lineage within the Afro-Palaearctic clade of the genus Rhinolophus. The group currently comprises four species widely distributed across the Palaearctic and Afrotropic regions: R. bocharicus (Central Asia), R. clivosus (from northern Africa and the Levant through Arabian Peninsula and eastern Africa to southern Africa), R. ferrumequinum (from western Europe and northern Africa through the Balkans and Middle East to Central Asia and India) and R. nippon (southern and central China, Korea, and Japan). The broad ranges and geographical variations within these species have led to the proposal of numerous subspecies. The phylogenetic relationships and intraspecific variation of the R. ferrumequinum group were investigated using a genetic approach. One mitochondrial marker and five nuclear markers were sequenced and supplemented with available sequences for all four species of the group. Our study revealed five major lineages within the R. ferrumequinum group, resulting in the recognition of four currently known species and identification of a new species. The prior name available for this lineage/species is R. acrotis. The relationships between the lineages varied depending on the chosen marker, leaving the interspecific relations within the ferrumequinum group unresolved. In addition, the results indicated that R. clivosus experienced historic introgression from northern Africa and the Levant, resulting in replacement of its mtDNA by that of R. ferrumequinum. Together, this study introduces a new Rhinolophus species, which increases the number of species in the ferrumequinum group to five.

AB  - Many animal species 'play dead' or feign death (in some cases called tonic immobility) as a defence strategy against predators, including some ants, although triggers and durations are poorly understood. We repeatedly observed such death-feigning behaviour in Polyrhachis femorata ants that occupied pygmy-possum nest boxes deployed on Kangaroo Island following the 2019-2020 bushfires that burnt half of the island. Most of the 759 bat and pygmy-possum boxes (901 cavities) were on burnt ground. In 3312 box cavity checks on 13 diverse properties during monitoring visits, 28 of 40 P. femorata records (first for South Australia) occurred in unburnt Critically Endangered Narrow-Leaf Mallee Woodland community, seven in adjacent mallee community containing narrow-leaf mallee, three in cup gum unburnt habitat, and two in one box on burnt ground. Fire may have affected the abundance and re-establishment of the species. Polyrhachis femorata engages in a surprising defensive immobility strategy in boxes, since it is not only undertaken by individuals facing a potential predator, but also by entire colonies. The death-feigning behaviours were complemented by plugging box entrances. Nest boxes may be used to study this mysterious behaviour in this poorly known species, although frequent observation could lead to nest abandonment by the ant.

AB  - Parkinsonia aculeata L. is native to South America and was recorded for the first time in Egypt in the wild. It was recorded in vegetation survey of Elephantine Island in Aswan Governorate in 2020, then it was recorded in Dakhla Oasis in the Western Desert in 2023. The species identity was confirmed by a comparative macromorphological study between the collected specimens and herbarium specimens from other countries, and live specimens cultivated in Antoniades Botanic Garden in Alexandria. The occurrence of this species in the natural habitats of Egypt represents an important disjunction of the biogeographic relevance and raises concerns. The species may cause negative impacts to native species, outcompeting species of the same functional group, or can increase fire hazards in the invaded areas. Taking into consideration that the species has already been naturalized in some countries, its further expansion in Egypt is a possibility. It is of great concern to monitor and control the spread of the species in Egypt and possibly promote an early eradication. Notes on the habitat in which the species has been recorded and its invasive status in Egypt and surrounding nations are discussed.

AB  - The key to fighting a biological invasion may lie in understanding every variable that can explain its success. The Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH) states that when an invader arrives to a new environment, the absence of its common enemies (predators, parasites and competitors) facilitates the invasion success. The Horseshoe whip snake (Hemorrhois hippocrepis) has been recently introduced from the Iberian Peninsula to the island of Ibiza, and it is currently threatening the only endemic vertebrate, the Ibiza wall lizard (Podarcis pityusensis). We hypothesized that the snake invasion success is caused by the absence of natural predators, and we checked the ERH by relating the tail breakage rate to predation pressure. The invasive population showed a much lower incidence of tail breakage than the source population, which is in agreement with the almost absence of snake predators among the Ibizan reduced and naive native vertebrate community. These results confirm the ERH, and support the prolongation of invasive snake trapping campaigns.

AB  - Increasing plant diversity in agroecosystems is often proposed as a way to reduce arthropod pest pressure and support natural enemy populations to reduce reliance on traditional chemical controls. Over 2 field seasons, we examined the effects of interplanting cantaloupe (Cucumis melo L. var. cantalupensis) with alsike clover (Trifolium hybridum L.) and Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus L.) on arthropod populations, cantaloupe yield, and fruit quality. Arthropod sampling through visual counts, sticky cards, and pitfall traps focused on herbivores and natural enemies across feeding guilds, with more specialized pests in the cucurbit system being identified to lower taxonomic levels. Living mulches might have delayed initial crop colonization by striped cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum F.) but had limited impact on beetle counts, which remained similarly low throughout the study across treatments. Aphid populations were lowest in wildrye interplanted plots, suggesting species-specific impacts on pest suppression. Beneficial arthropods, such as spiders, piercing predators, and parasitoids, were often more abundant in clover than in wildrye or monoculture plots, especially early in the season. However, cantaloupe yield was highest in monoculture plots, where fruit showed increased weight, size, and favorable color metrics compared to those from living mulch plots. These results indicate that while living mulches can support beneficial arthropods and possibly reduce early pest pressure, they may also introduce trade-offs in yield and quality. Future studies should explore adjustments to living mulch management in cantaloupe, such as reduced density or narrower planting strips, to optimize pest suppression benefits while limiting competition with the cash crop.

AB  - Globally, wildlife populations are becoming increasingly small and isolated. Both processes contribute to an elevated risk of extinction, notably due to genetic factors related to inbreeding depression and a loss of adaptive potential. Wildlife translocation is a valuable conservation tool to reintroduce species to previously occupied areas, or augment existing populations with genetically divergent animals, thereby improving the viability of endangered populations. However, understanding the genetic implications of mixing gene pools is key to avoid the risk of outbreeding depression, and to maximise translocation effectiveness. In this study we used mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA collected from 110 black rhinoceroses (Diceros bicornis minor) in Kruger National Park, South Africa, to determine levels of genetic diversity, inbreeding and relatedness. We compared this diversity with the two source populations (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa and Zambezi River, Zimbabwe) using data from previously published studies, and assessed changes in the relative contribution of source lineages since their reintroduction in the 1970s. Our results show that Kruger's black rhinoceroses are genetically more diverse than those from KwaZulu-Natal, with levels closer to those from the Zambezi Valley. Furthermore, our findings indicate a relative increase in the Zimbabwean lineage since reintroduction, suggesting a possible selective advantage. From a conservation perspective, our results demonstrate the benefits of mixing multiple source populations to restore gene flow, improve genetic diversity and thereby help protect small, isolated populations from extinction.

AB  - Contents This study investigated the effects of melatonin implants in the female and male animals before the breeding season on the reproductive performance of Tahirova sheep and Turkish Saanen goats. Seventy-five sheep and 53 goats (including 6 rams and 4 bucks) were used in the research. Melatonin implants (18 mg) were applied to half of the female and male animals, one to female animals and three to male animals. The rate of oestrus was determined as 100% in the melatonin (M) and control (C) groups. The non-return rate, conception rate and lambing rate were close in both groups of ewes and rams groups (p > .05). The rate of oestrus was 100% in the melatonin and control groups of does and bucks groups in Turkish Saanen goats. The non-return rate in does was 75.0 +/- 9.02% in M group and 92.0 +/- 5.53% in C group (p = .0101), the non-return rate was 83.3 +/- 6.92% in group M and 84.2 +/- 8.59% in group C for bucks (p = .5570). For ewes, the duration from ram introduction to first oestrus, conception and lambing was significantly lower in group M than in group C (p <= .05). Litter size of M in ewe and ram groups were 1.70 +/- 0.08 and 1.59 +/- 0.09, respectively, whereas it was 1.62 +/- 0.10 and 1.74 +/- 0.10 in C group, respectively. Birth weight significantly differed between ewe groups (p = .0017). For goats, the duration from buck introduction to first oestrus, conception and lambing was similar in the groups of does and bucks (p > .05). Litter size of M in doe and buck groups were 1.57 +/- 0.11 and 1.53 +/- 0.12, respectively, and 1.46 +/- 0.11and 1.50 +/- 0.09 in C group, respectively (p > .05). While the live weight and body condition score (BCS) of ewes were significantly affected by melatonin implants (p <= .05), the live weight and BCS of does were not affected. In conclusion, it might be said that melatonin implants obtained better results for reproduction in Tahirova sheep than Turkish Saanen goats.

AB  - Hybridization between wild animals and feral individuals from closely related domestic species can occur when they share the same habitat. Such events are generally regarded as a threat to the genetic integrity and survival of established wild populations. The aim of this study is to confirm a hybridization between European mouflon and feral sheep on the Adriatic island Dugi Otok, where a group of individuals phenotypically indicative of a possible introgression was photographed. Using an ovine medium-density SNP array genotypes, we provided genetic evidence of recent gene admixture between the two species. The ADMIXTURE analysis suggests that two hybrid individuals had 82.2% and 94.1% of their ancestry attributable to feral sheep, respectively, with the rest of the mouflon in origin. NEWHYBRIDS analysis estimated the combined probabilities for the putative hybrid individuals belonging to one of the hybrid classes at 87.0% and 90.1%, respectively. The main phenotypic differences in the hybrids were observed in the shape of the horns, a stronger horn circumference than in the mouflon and weaker than for the sheep, pronounced horn rings, a shorter tail, and intermediate color. We therefore recommend constant monitoring of the purity of the mouflon population to maintain its genetic integrity. In addition, all feral sheep should be removed from the wild, and released sheep raised in semi-wild conditions should be better controlled.

AB  - Introduction: Erythrina americana is a tree legume found as part of the fence of livestock farms of the tropical region. However, sheep farmers do not routinely or strategically use the foliage of this type of legume as a dietary supplement due, in part, to ignorance of its chemical composition and foliar performance, as well as the factors that affect them. Objective: To determine the influence of season and diameter of E. americana tree on the chemical composition and foliage yield at a 90-day regrowth age. Methods: 47 trees were used in a two-factor design. The factors were season (dry and rainy) and tree diameter at 0.20 m above ground level (D-9 between 0.05 and 0.09 m and D-13, between 0.091 to 0.13 m). The response variables were dry matter production and crude protein from foliage (kg arbol(-1)). Results: The season did not affect (P > 0.05) the production of dry matter and crude protein. However, the diameter of E. americana affected them (P < 0.01). In diameter D-13, the highest production of dry matter and crude foliar protein tree(-1) was detected with respect to D-9. Conclusions: The diameter of the tree had a more influence than the season on yield of dry matter and crude protein.

AB  - Simple Summary This study is the first to assess the presence of micro-litter ingested by four species of marine mammals and two species of sea turtles, found stranded along the coastline of Samos Island, north-eastern Aegean Sea, Greece. Litter particles, identified as microplastics, were ubiquitous throughout all the digestive tracts analysed. This study suggests there is widespread microplastic contamination in marine megafauna in the study area, and proposes a method of standardisation to facilitate comparisons. This study is the first to assess the occurrence of micro-litter ingested by marine megafauna in the north-eastern Aegean Sea. A total of 25 specimens from four species of marine mammals, including dolphins and monk seals, and two species of sea turtles, found stranded along the coastline of Samos Island, Greece, were selected for the analysis. Litter particles, identified as microplastics (MPs), were ubiquitous throughout all sections of the gastrointestinal tract (oesophagus, stomach and intestine) in all specimens. Overall, the MPs most frequently found were black fibres 0.21-0.50 mm in size. These results provide insight into the extent of micro-litter ingestion and contamination in marine vertebrates. Here we propose a method of standardisation to establish a baseline for marine taxa in this region of the Mediterranean Sea, where knowledge of the topic is still lacking.

AB  - The natural stratification and interlocking "organization" of armored sediments in heterogeneous, coarse-grained, beaches provides protection and enhances habitat for burrowing sedentary megafauna and macrofauna such as hard-shelled clams. Here, we develop a novel metric for quantifying sediment organization of large surficial beach clasts through sedimentologic and photogrammetric analyses of 37 lower intertidal heterogeneous gravel beaches in western Prince William Sound, Alaska (USA). Grain size, photogrammetric, and Wolman Pebble Count clast-size data from 64, similar to 1-m(2) study plots are combined into a clast-size-independent "Organization Metric" to quantify the degree of organization in the meshed arrangement of larger surficial sediments. This metric was validated through field manipulation experiments and comparisons of adjacent plots characterized by different clast sizes. Application of this metric to subsets of Prince William Sound beaches that underwent differential treatment following the Exxon Valdez oil spill reveals persistent physical effects of artificial beach disturbance even 21 years after the cleanup. This has important implications for beach management (e.g., cleaning or dredging) and for the diverse and productive sedentary megafaunal assemblages that live within these sediments. Overall, this study provides a new approach for quantifying organization of heterogenous coarse sediments in diverse natural settings; in particular, heterogenous gravel beaches.

AB  - Surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae) are diverse and common members of coral reef faunal assemblages and are important coastal fisheries resources throughout the tropics. Life-history research provides a foundation for understanding and predicting population dynamics and is therefore important to fisheries management. However, our understanding of surgeonfish biology stems primarily from high-latitude tropical regions where they exhibit multidecadal life spans. To derive an eco-evolutionary and biogeographic perspective on the biology of acanthurids, we derived age-based life-history information for a suite of species representing over 99% of the surgeonfish fishery in the Mariana Islands. Multivariate analysis failed to provide a powerful summary of trait variation among surgeonfishes, as body size is not positively correlated with longevity, growth trajectories and length of maturation varied widely among species, and mortality is not simply a function of size or growth. In fact, seven of twelve species studied exhibited unusual biphasic mortality pattern. Different modes of reproductive investment in species appear to carry a taxonomic signature and may influence the vulnerability of some species to overexploitation. Comparisons with previous studies demonstrated a strong thermal gradient in life span and body size across latitude. Ultimately, surgeonfishes display puzzling features whereby extended life spans are uncharacteristically coupled with higher-than-expected mortality rates as a result of biphasic mortality schedules at the population level. Trait relationships among species are not straightforward, posing challenges for designing effective management and for predicting population dynamics under global climate change.

AB  - Simple Summary The Analysis of genomic data is an important resource for the effective management of small and endangered populations. The aim of this work was to study the genomic structure of a local goat named Mascaruna. Overall, the results indicate moderate genetic variability and a defined population structure and represent a starting point for the creation of monitoring and conservation plans. Italy contains a large number of local goat populations, some of which do not have a recognized genetic structure. The "Mascaruna" is a goat population reared for milk production in Sicily. In this study, a total of 72 individuals were genotyped with the Illumina Goat_IGGC_65K_v2 BeadChip with the aim to characterize the genetic diversity, population structure and relatedness with another 31 Italian goat populations. The results displayed a moderate level of genetic variability for Mascaruna, in concordance with the estimated values for Italian goats. Runs of homozygosity islands are linked to genes involved in milk production, immune response and local adaptation. Population structure analyses separated Mascaruna from the other goat populations, indicating a clear genetic differentiation. Although they are not conclusive, our current results represent a starting point for the creation of monitoring and conservation plans. Additional analyses and a wider sampling would contribute to refine and validate these results. Finally, our study describing the diversity and structure of Mascaruna confirms the usefulness of applied genomic analyses as valid tools for the study of the local uncharacterized genetic resources.

AB  - Aims Invasive plants often succeed despite attack by generalist herbivores in the introduced range. Whether invasive plants tolerate herbivory by adjusting functional traits, modulating the rhizosphere bacterial community, or both, and how root exudates of native plants influence these tolerance mechanisms, is yet to be tested.
   Methods We examined the impacts of defoliation (simulated herbivory) and root exudates from a native tree Ailanthus altissima on the growth, functional traits, and rhizosphere bacterial community composition of the invasive tree Rhus typhina. We conducted a greenhouse experiment with three levels of simulated herbivory (0%, 40%, and 80% of leaves removed) and four A. altissima root exudate treatments (none, weakened with activated carbon, natural, and added).
   Results In response to defoliation when grown in monoculture, R. typhina decreased aboveground biomass allocation but increased specific leaf area, whereas rhizosphere bacterial community composition was unaffected. When grown in mixture, defoliation decreased total biomass in the weakened root exudates treatment but not with natural and added root exudates, suggesting that A. altissima root exudates reduced R. typhina biomass but increased R. typhina tolerance of defoliation. Ailanthus altissima root exudates also reduced the negative impact of defoliation on putative keystone bacteria relative abundance.
   Conclusions Our results demonstrate that root exudates of native plants can promote tolerance of invasive plants to simulated herbivory via influencing functional traits and potentially also rhizosphere keystone taxa. Our study adds to evidence that plasticity of functional traits and the rhizosphere bacterial community may contribute to invasive plant tolerance of biotic stressors.

AB  - Here, we constructed a novel bacterial deodorant (BD) composed of Delftia tsuruhatensis, Paracoccus denitrificans, Pediococcus acidilactici, and Bacillus velezensis. The BD alone removed 64.84 % of NH3, 100 % of H2S, and 63.68 % of comprehensive odor (OU) during a five-day fermentation of pig manure. The effect was enhanced by introducing Camellia sinensis in the composite bacterial deodorant (CBD) treatment, with the removal efficiency (RE) of NH3 and OU being 88.68 % and 88.14 %, respectively. In prolonged trials, maximum RE of NH3, H2S and OU RE reached 90.16 %, 92.32 % and 100 % in CBD group. Bacterial composition of manure revealed that the abundance of odor-producing microbes (Kurthia, Solibacillus, Proteiniphilum and Acholeplasma) and potential pathogens decreased after CBD application. Functional prediction and correlation analyses indicated that the process of nitrification, denitrification and S/N assimilation were facilitated, while S/N mineralization and methanogenesis processes might be inhibited. This deodorant promoted the conversion of malodorous substances into non-odorous forms, establishing an efficient odor removal system in hoggery. Therefore, the bacterial deodorant compounded with C. sinensis has been shown to be an effective method for deodorizing pig farms. This approach will advance the livestock industry toward greener practices and environmental protection, contributing positively to the development of a sustainable agro-ecosystem.

AB  - Field boundaries are important habitat for bats in agricultural landscapes, serving as commuting and foraging areas for many species. The goal of our study was to better understand the drivers of bat activity in agricultural landscapes to inform conservation policy and make specific recommendations for habitat management. We placed sixty-four full spectrum bat detectors at random recording locations, weekly, along field boundaries in North Somerset between July and October 2020. We used an automated classifier to analyse recordings and performed error rate modelling to account for and remove the majority of error in automated classifications. We used generalised additive models to explore bat response to recording location metrics, controlling for spatial-autocorrelation and temporal differences in sampling. We validated our models with k-fold cross-validation and explored the utility of our models for predicting bat activity at new sites. We found that field boundary characteristics better describe bat activity than adjacent field characteristics or measures of local landscape for the majority of species studied. Bat activity was higher along tall, wide, vegetated field boundaries containing trees; there was lower activity at arable recording locations. Still, bat activity was highly variable and predictive error was high. We found a large spatial effect driving activity patterns, meaning models are not able to predict activity beyond the extent of the study area. We recommend management strategies that give incentives to farmers for replacing fences with hedgerows, planting hedgerow trees, and maintaining tall and outgrown field boundaries.

AB  - The time interval between fires is a critical component of the fire regime that affects plant species persistence in fire-prone ecosystems. Fire intervals that are too short or too long may not support regeneration from seed banks or resprouting. Fire intervals that support adequate regeneration may also vary with other factors such as climate, herbivory, and population structure. Using field data on flowering and canopy seed banks, we modelled post-fire reproduction for woody fire-killed (obligate seeding) and resprouting species under varying rainfall and herbivory along a 35-year fire age chronosequence in Banksia woodlands in southwestern Australia. We found that fire-killed species attained reproductive maturity rapidly after fire with predicted juvenile periods (time to 50% flowering) of 1.5-2.3 years for shrubs and 4 years for trees. Resprouting species had similar juvenile periods to fire-killed species (1-3.5 years for resprouting shrubs, 4.4 years for resprouting trees). Reproduction varied with rainfall and herbivory with juvenile periods at least doubling under low rainfall or high herbivory for some species. Serotinous species produced cones (woody fruits containing seeds) shortly after flowering commenced, with some evidence of seed bank decline in the oldest sites. While reproduction was clearly correlated with time since fire, plant size was a much stronger predictor. Some species form multi-cohort populations which can introduce large variation into post-fire reproductive trajectories, and this should be considered when making decisions about fire intervals that may impact species persistence. This study provides critical information to assess fire interval-related threats for Banksia woodlands and suggests that woody species of these woodlands are generally tolerant of a wide range of fire intervals. Only the slowest-maturing, fire-killed species (Banksia prionotes, Proteaceae) may require fire intervals > 10 years to reduce immaturity risk under the least favourable growing conditions, and this species often occurs in discrete patches in the landscape such that fire management can be tailored accordingly.

AB  - The effect of sex-biased dispersal in mammalian ecology and evolution can be elucidated by focusing on maternally or paternally inherited DNA polymorphisms. In sika deer, the genetic structure of the maternal lineage has been clarified by studies based on mitochondrial DNA variation. However, the genetic structure of the paternal lineage has not been well analyzed due to the limited number of point mutations in Y chromosome sequences. In this study, we focused on mutations of highly polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in the Y chromosome and developed 16 Y chromosome SSR markers to evaluate male-biased dispersal in sika deer. In total, 55 alleles and 31 multi-locus haplotypes were detected from these 16 loci, revealing clear genetic differentiation among populations (F '(ST) = 0.783). In particular, there were unique alleles for the native individuals on Tanegashima and Yakushima Islands and introduced exotic individuals from Taiwan. These markers are highly useful for evaluating not only historical male-mediated dispersal, genetic structure, and demography of the native populations in Japan, but also the impact of artificial introductions on hybridization, especially the introgression of alleles from escaped farmed individuals to native populations.

AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can be transmitted between pigs and humans on farms. Hence, the reduction of MRSA carriage in pigs could decrease the risk of zoonotic transmission. Recently, straw bedding has been found to significantly reduce MRSA carriage in pigs. The mechanisms behind this effect remain unclear but changes in the nasal microbiome may play a role. In this exploratory study, the nasal microbiota of pigs kept on straw was examined using V1/V2 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Nasal swabs were collected from 13 pigs at six different time points during the course of a full fattening cycle resulting in 74 porcine samples. In addition, straw samples were collected at each time point. Eleven out of 13 pigs were MRSA positive at housing-in. We found a strong temporal pattern in the microbial communities. Both microbial diversity and abundance of Staphylococcus species peaked in week 5 after introduction to the straw stable decreased in week 10, when all pigs turned MRSA-negative, and increased again toward the end of the fattening period. These findings show that the introduction of pigs into a new environment has a huge impact on their nasal microbiota, which might lead to unfavorable conditions for MRSA. Moreover, other Staphylococcus species may play a role in eliminating MRSA carriage. We designed a follow-up study including two different husbandry systems to further assess these effects.

AB  - In China, wild Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) are primarily distributed in three prefectures in Southwest Yunnan, along the border with Laos and Myanmar. These elephants occur in small, fragmented populations and face significant threats from habitat loss and fragmentation. Here, we successfully retrieved 48 mitochondrial genomes, including those from 35 wild Asian elephants in China and those from 13 captive Asian elephants, based on whole genome sequencing data to analyze their maternal population structure and genetic diversity. In addition, we extracted approximately 600 kb of non-coding genomic regions for a comparative analysis of the genetic structure between the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Wild Asian elephants in China exhibited extremely low genetic diversity compared to global populations, with only two haplotypes detected in the Chinese population. Despite limited mitochondrial haplotypes, the Xishuangbanna population maintains gene flow with external populations. In contrast, the genetic diversity in the Cangyuan population was even more severely limited, with no evidence of gene flow with the nearest populations in Myanmar. Given the close genetic relationship between the Cangyuan population and populations in other countries, the most promising strategy for introducing genetic diversity to rescue the Cangyuan population may involve translocating Asian elephants from other countries. This study provides a deeper understanding of the genetic status of wild Asian elephants in China and offers important insights for future conservation efforts in China and elsewhere.

AB  - Southeast Asia is renowned for its exceptional biodiversity and complex biogeography, shaped by major faunal boundaries such as the Wallace and Huxley Lines. Among the most iconic Pleistocene megafauna in the region is Stegodon, an extinct proboscidean relative of modern elephants, commonly represented in fossil assemblages across various Southeast Asian islands, including Luzon, Philippines. However, the evolutionary history and dispersal of the Luzon Stegodon remain poorly resolved due to the scarcity of diagnostic cranial material. Here, we present the first formal description of a Stegodon skull from the Philippines, recovered from Lannig, Solana, Cagayan (northeastern Luzon), along the northwestern flank of the Enrile Anticline, and likely originating from the lower Awidon Mesa Formation, estimated to be of late Early Pleistocene age. The specimen (CM-B-1-2021) is fragmentary and deformed, preserving a complete right upper cheek tooth, interpreted as the first molar (M1), and the proximal sections of two small tusks. Morphological and morphometric comparisons indicate it belonged to a late juvenile (approaching subadult) intermediate-sized individual with affinities to the S. trigonocephalus group. Notably, the molar's narrow, nearly subhypsodont morphology closely resembles that of S. f. florensis from Flores, Indonesia (late Early to Middle Pleistocene), suggesting a possible north-south faunal connection between the Philippines and Wallacea, island-hopping across the Wallace Line. This study provides new insights into Stegodon dispersal dynamics across Southeast Asia and highlights the need for a comprehensive reexamination of other Luzon Stegodon specimens to refine their taxonomy and clarify broader evolutionary patterns in the region.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are root symbionts that can facilitate plant growth and influence plant communities by altering plant interactions with herbivores. Therefore, AM fungi could be critical for the conservation of certain rare plants and herbivores. For example, North American milkweed species are crucial hosts for monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus). Understanding how mycorrhizal composition affects milkweeds will have direct impacts on the conservation and restoration of both increasingly threatened guilds. We present data from three studies on the effect of AM fungal composition on milkweed growth, latex production, and establishment. First, we grew seven milkweed species with and without a mixture of native mycorrhizal fungi. We assessed how important fungal composition is to milkweed growth and latex production by growing four milkweed species with seven fungal compositions, as single-species inoculations with four native fungi, a mixture of native fungi, a single commercial fungus of presumably non-native origin, and noninoculated controls. Finally, we assessed the field establishment of two milkweed species with and without native mycorrhizal inoculation. Milkweed species grew 98% larger and produced 82% more latex after inoculation with native mycorrhizae. Milkweeds were strongly affected by fungal composition; milkweeds were inhibited by commercial fungi (average of -14% growth) and showed variable but positive responses to native fungal species (average of +3% to +38% biomass). Finally, we found that restoration establishment was dependent on inoculation with native fungi and milkweed species. Overall, our findings indicate that some milkweed species (i.e., Asclepias syriaca and A. incarnata) are not responsive to mycorrhizal fungal presence or sensitive to mycorrhizal composition while others are, including endangered species (A. meadii) and species of high conservation value (A. tuberosa). We conclude that the reintroduction of native AM fungi could improve the establishment of desirable milkweed species and should be considered within strategies for plantings for monarch conservation.

AB  - Effective waste management is a major challenge for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) like Maldives due to limited land availability. Maldives exemplifies these issues as one of the most geographically dispersed countries, with a population unevenly distributed across numerous islands varying greatly in size and population density. This study provides an in-depth analysis of the unique waste management practices across different regions of Maldives in relation to its natural and socioeconomic context. Data shows Maldives has one of the highest population density and per capita waste generation among SIDS, despite its small land area and medium GDP per capita. Large disparities exist between the densely populated capital Male' with only 5.8 km2 area generating 63% of waste and the similar to 194 scattered outer islands with ad hoc waste management practices. Given Male's dense population and high calorific waste, incineration could generate up to similar to 30 GW/a energy and even increase Maldives' renewable energy supply by 200%. In contrast, decentralized anaerobic digestion presents an optimal solution for outer islands to reduce waste volume while providing over 40%-100% energy supply for daily cooking in local families. This timely study delivers valuable insights into designing context-specific waste-to-energy systems and integrated waste policies tailored to Maldives' distinct regions. The framework presented can also guide other SIDS facing similar challenges as Maldives in establishing sustainable, ecologically sound waste management strategies.

AB  - An emerging research program on population and geographic range dynamics of Australia's mammals illustrates an approach to better understand and respond to geographic range collapses of threatened wildlife in general. In 1788, Europeans colonized an Australia with a diverse and largely endemic mammal fauna, where many species that are now extinct or threatened were common and widespread. Subsequent population declines, range collapses and extinctions were caused by introduced predators and herbivores, altered land use, modified fire regimes and the synergies between these threats. Declines in population and range size continue for many Australian mammals despite legislative protection and conservation interventions. Here, we propose an approach that integrates museum data and other historical records into process-explicit macroecological models to better resolve mammal distributions and abundances as they were at European arrival. We then illustrate how this integrative approach can identify the likely synergistic mechanisms causing mammal population declines across these and other landscapes. This emerging research approach, undertaken with fine temporal and spatial resolution, but at large geographic scales, will provide valuable insights into the different pathways to, and drivers of, extinction. Such insights may, in turn, underpin conservation strategies based on a process-explicit understanding of population decline and range collapse under alternative scenarios of impending climate and environmental change. Given that similar information is available for other regional biotas, the approach we describe here can be adapted to conserve threatened wildlife in other regions across the globe.

AB  - Intraguild interactions among carnivores have long held the fascination of ecologists. Ranging from competition to facilitation and coexistence, these interactions and their complex interplay influence everything from species persistence to ecosystem functioning. Yet, the patterns and pathways of such interactions are far from understood in tropical forest systems, particularly across countries in the Global South. Here, we examined the determinants and consequences of competitive interactions between dholes Cuon alpinus and the two large felids (leopards Panthera pardus and tigers Panthera tigris) with which they most commonly co-occur across Asia. Using a combination of traditional and novel data sources (N = 118), we integrate information from spatial, temporal, and dietary niche dimensions. These three species have faced catastrophic declines in their extent of co-occurrence over the past century; most of their source populations are now confined to Protected Areas. Analysis of dyadic interactions between species pairs showed a clear social hierarchy. Tigers were dominant over dholes, although pack strength in dholes helped ameliorate some of these effects; leopards were subordinate to dholes. Population-level spatio-temporal interactions assessed at 25 locations across Asia did not show a clear pattern of overlap or avoidance between species pairs. Diet-profile assessments indicated that wild ungulate biomass consumption by tigers was highest, while leopards consumed more primate and livestock prey as compared to their co-predators. In terms of prey offtake (ratio of wild prey biomass consumed to biomass available), the three species together harvested 0.4-30.2% of available prey, with the highest offtake recorded from the location where the carnivores reach very high densities. When re-examined in the context of prey availability and offtake, locations with low wild prey availability showed spatial avoidance and temporal overlap among the carnivore pairs, and locations with high wild prey availability showed spatial overlap and temporal segregation. Based on these observations, we make predictions for 40 Protected Areas in India where temporally synchronous estimates of predator and prey densities are available. We expect that low prey availability will lead to higher competition, and in extreme cases, to the complete exclusion of one or more species. In Protected Areas with high prey availability, we expect intraguild coexistence and conspecific competition among carnivores, with spill-over to forest-edge habitats and subsequent prey-switching to livestock. We stress that dhole-leopard-tiger co-occurrence across their range is facilitated through an intricate yet fragile balance between prey availability, and intraguild and conspecific competition. Data gaps and limitations notwithstanding, our study shows how insights from fundamental ecology can be of immense utility for applied aspects like large predator conservation and management of human-carnivore interactions. Our findings also highlight potential avenues for future research on tropical carnivores that can broaden current understanding of intraguild competition in forest systems of Asia and beyond.

AB  - Plants often associate with multiple arthropod mutualists. These partners provide important services to their hosts, but multiple interactions can constrain a plant's ability to respond to complex, multivariate selection. Here, we quantified patterns of genetic variance and covariance among rewards for pollination, biotic defence and seed dispersal mutualisms in multiple populations of Turnera ulmifolia to better understand how the genetic architecture of multiple mutualisms might influence their evolution. We phenotyped plants cultivated from 17 Jamaican populations for several mutualism and mating system-related traits. We then fit genetic variance-covariance (G) matrices for the island metapopulation and the five largest individual populations. At the metapopulation level, we observed significant positive genetic correlations among stigma-anther separation, floral nectar production and extrafloral nectar production. These correlations have the potential to significantly constrain or facilitate the evolution of multiple mutualisms in T. ulmifolia and suggest that pollination, seed dispersal and dispersal mutualisms do not evolve independently. In particular, we found that positive genetic correlations between floral and extrafloral nectar production may help explain their stable coexistence in the face of physiological trade-offs and negative interactions between pollinators and ant bodyguards. Locally, we found only small differences in G among our T. ulmifolia populations, suggesting that geographic variation in G may not shape the evolution of multiple mutualisms.

AB  - In order to enhance breeding programs and boost genetic features related to disease resistance, productivity and adaptability, it is essential to predict harmful mutations in livestock animals. The genetic adaptations enabling Changthangi goats to thrive in high-altitude environments are essential for their survival in conditions marked by hypoxia, extreme temperatures and oxidative stress. Therefore, in this study, missense mutations were mined within key candidate genes, namely CXCL9, MRPL22 and SDS involved in hypoxic stress, in Changthangi goats to assess their potential effects on the structural integrity of the proteins. Two SNPs (rs653275315, rs654804090) were identified with significant impacts on protein structure and stability, while one SNP (rs644425445) was categorized as benign. The SNP rs654804090 introduced changes in hydrophobicity, impairing protein stability, whereas rs653275315 affected conserved domains critical for function. Structural analyses revealed that the identified mutations disrupted protein folding, stability and molecular interactions, particularly in highly conserved residues, underscoring their evolutionary significance. Phylogenetic conservation analysis further highlighted the adaptive relevance of these mutations, particularly in regions subjected to environmental stressors. Our findings reveal potentially detrimental mutations in the genes CXCL9, MRPL22 and SDS, which may contribute to the development of genetic screening tools for selective breeding initiatives especially in high-altitude settings where genetic resistance to environmental stress is essential.

AB  - Northwest Atlantic harbor (Phoca vitulina vitulina) and gray (Halichoerus grypus atlantica) seal populations are recovering from early to mid-20th century exploitation, increasing their biological interactions and bycatch in Northeastern US commercial fisheries. We evaluated the seals' diet composition and compared their prey to commercial catches to assess trophic overlap and potential competition with commercial fisherman target catches. We obtained 148 harbor and 178 gray seal stomach samples from bycatch events that occurred between 2004 and 2018. We learned from the hard part remains that the majority of seals bycaught are young-of-the-year (<= 12 months old) that consume a wide breadth of prey across three trophic groups. There was a general dichotomy in extrinsic factors associated with seal diet in which 45% trophic niche separation was explained by non-overlapping harbor and gray seal phenology and pup haul-out locations that are adjacent to active fishing areas. Prey size estimated from fish otoliths and squid beaks recovered from stomach contents showed that gray seals consumed larger prey than harbor seals and prey sizes from both seals showed limited overlap with prey sizes caught by commercial gillnet fishermen. The most important prey to both seals included large (>20 cm) and small (<= 20 cm) silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis), (<= 40 cm) red hake (Urophycis chuss), gulf stream flounder (Citharichthys arctifrons), medium (21-40 cm) white hake (Urophycis tenuis), and (<50 cm) Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Important prey to harbor seals that did not overlap with gray seals were Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), longfin (Doryteuthis pealeii), and shortfin squid (Illex illecebrosus). They contrasted with prey important to gray seals that did not overlap with harbor seals: yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea), sand lance (Ammodytes spp.), Urophycis spp., and fourspot flounder (Hippoglossina oblonga). Despite the potential bias associated with opportunistic bycatch sampling, this study demonstrates the importance and value of utilizing carcasses retained from bycatch events, is complimentary to newer methodologies (i.e., DNA meta-barcoding), and fills data gaps in our understanding of the role recovering harbor and gray seal populations have on Northeastern US regional food webs.

AB  - The Australian freshwater turtle fauna is dominated by species in the family Chelidae. The extant fauna comprises a series of distinct lineages, each of considerable antiquity, relicts of a more extensive and perhaps diverse fauna that existed when wetter climes prevailed. Several phylogenetically distinctive species are restricted to single, often small, drainage basins, which presents challenges for their conservation. Specific threats include water resource development, which alters the magnitude, frequency, and timing of flows and converts lentic to lotic habitat via dams and weirs, fragmentation of habitat, sedimentation, nutrification, and a reduction in the frequency and extent of floodplain flooding. Drainage of wetlands and altered land use are of particular concern for some species that are now very restricted in range and critically endangered. The introduced European red fox is a devastatingly efficient predator of turtle nests and can have a major impact on recruitment. In the north, species such as the northern snake-necked turtle are heavily depredated by feral pigs. Other invasive animals and aquatic weeds dramatically alter freshwater habitats, with consequential impacts on freshwater turtles. Novel pathogens such as viruses have brought at least one species to the brink of extinction. Species that routinely migrate across land are impacted by structural simplification of habitat, reduction in availability of terrestrial refugia, fencing (including conservation fencing), and in some areas, by high levels of road mortality. We report on the listing process and challenges for listing freshwater turtles under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, summarize the state of knowledge relevant to listing decisions, identify the key threatening processes impacting turtles, and identify key knowledge gaps that impede the setting of priorities. We also focus on how to best incorporate First Nations Knowledge into decisions on listing and discuss opportunities to engage Indigenous communities in on-ground work to achieve conservation outcomes.

AB  - The pressures of global change acting on wild plants and animals include exposure to environmental toxins, the introduction of non-native species, and climate change. Relatively few studies have been reported in which these three main classes of stressors have been examined simultaneously, allowing for the possibility of synergistic effects in an experimental context. In this study, we exposed caterpillars of the Melissa blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa) to three concentrations of chlorantraniliprole, under three experimental climates, on a diet of a native or a non-native host plant throughout larval development in a fully factorial experiment. We find that high pesticide exposure and a non-native diet exhibit strong negative effects on caterpillars, resulting in 62% and 42% reduction in survival, respectively, while interactive effects tend to be weaker, ranging from 15% to 22% reduction in survival. Interactive effects have been shown to be strong in other contexts, but do not appear to be universal; however, our study shows that the cumulative effects of stressors acting in isolation (additively) are sufficiently strong to severely reduce survival and by extension population persistence in the wild.

AB  - The reintroduction of endangered plant species is an essential conservation tool. Reintroductions can fail to create resilient, self-sustaining populations due to a poor understanding of environmental factors that limit or promote plant success. Biotic factors, specifically plant-arthropod interactions, have been shown to affect the establishment of endangered plant populations. Lupinus nipomensis (Nipomo Mesa lupine) is a state of California (California Rare Plant Rank: 1B.1) and federally (65 FR 14888) endangered endemic plant with only one extant population located along the central California coast. How arthropods positively or negatively interact with L. nipomensis is not well known and more information could aid conservation efforts. We conducted arthropod surveys of the entire L. nipomensis extant population in spring 2017. Observed arthropods present on L. nipomensis included 17 families, with a majority of individuals belonging to Thripidae. We did not detect any obvious pollinators of L. nipomensis, providing support for previous studies suggesting this lupine is capable of self-pollinating, and observed several arthropod genera that could potentially impact the reproductive success of L. nipomensis via incidental pollination or plant predation.

AB  - This paper presents a new ensemble ecosystem model (EEM) which predicts the impacts of species reintroductions and optimises potential future management interventions at the Knepp Estate rewilding project, UK. Compared to other EEMs, Knepp has a relatively high level of data availability that can be used to constrain the model, including time-series abundance data and expert knowledge. This could improve the realism of outputs and enable more nuanced and context-specific management intervention recommendations. Calibrating EEMs can be challenging, however, and as the number of constraints increases, so does the complexity of the model fitting process. We use a new Genetic Algorithm-Approximate Bayesian Computation (GA-ABC) approach wherein GA outputs are used to inform the prior distributions for ABC. To reduce the parameter search space, we fixed twelve parameters - the consumer self-interaction strengths alpha i,i and negative growth rates - based on theoretical assumptions. While the GA-ABC method proved effective at efficiently searching the parameter space and optimising multiple constraints, it was computationally intensive and struggled to identify a broad range of outputs. Ultimately, this led to an ensemble of models with similar trajectories. Several potential ways to address this are discussed. Our results reinforce the findings of previous studies that the EEM methodology has potential for guiding conservation management and decision-making. Outputs suggest that reintroducing large herbivores was key to maintaining a diverse grassland-scrubland-woodland ecosystem, and optimisation experiments informed species characteristics and stocking densities needed to achieve specific goals. Ultimately, refining the EEM methodology to improve calibration and facilitate the integration of additional data will enhance its utility for ecosystem management, helping to achieve more effective and informed outcomes.

AB  - Simple Summary Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) causes a highly devastating disease, peste des petits ruminants (PPR) of sheep and goats, that threatens food security, small ruminant production, and the conservation of wild small ruminants. Current efforts are directed towards the global control and eradication of PPRV, an initiative of the World Organisation for Animal Health and Food and the Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. A plethora of diagnostic tools for PPR were primarily developed for livestock. New innovative diagnostic tools are needed to detect PPRV in atypical hosts (e.g., Camelidae, Suidae, and Bovinae), in wildlife ecosystems, and in complex field situations. Recent studies confirmed that single-domain antigen binding fragments (nanobodies) derived from heavy-chain-only camelid antibodies have proven to be a powerful tool in diagnostics and therapeutics due to their unique properties, such as small size and strong antigen-binding affinity. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to generate PPRV-reactive nanobodies in order to set a pace for the development of diagnostic and possibly therapeutic nanobodies in the future. Initially, a strategy was developed whereby an alpaca was immunized with PPRV in order to raise an affinity-matured immune response, from which an immune nanobody library was constructed. Following phage display, nine nanobodies that specifically recognise PPRV were identified on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. This study has generated PPRV-reactive nanobodies and have significant implications in the development of cost-effective diagnostic tools in context with the planned eradication of PPR in the world. Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) causes a highly devastating disease, peste des petits ruminants (PPR) of sheep and goats, that threatens food security, small ruminant production, and the conservation of wild small ruminants in many developing countries, especially in Africa. Robust serological and molecular diagnostic tools are available to detect PPRV infection, but they were mainly developed for domestic sheep and goats. The presence of a wide host range for PPRV does present serological diagnostic challenges. New innovative diagnostic tools are needed to detect PPRV in atypical hosts (e.g., Camelidae, Suidae, and Bovinae), in wildlife ecosystems and in complex field situations. Interestingly, single-domain antigen binding fragments (nanobodies) derived from heavy-chain-only camelid antibodies have emerged as a new hope in the development of accurate, rapid, and cost-effective diagnostic tools in veterinary and biomedical fields that are suitable for low-income countries. The main objective of this study was to construct an immune nanobody library to retrieve PPRV-reactive nanobodies that enable the development of diagnostic and therapeutic nanobodies in the future. Here, a strategy was developed whereby an alpaca (Vicugna pacos) was immunized with a live attenuated vaccine strain (PPRV/N/75/1) to raise an affinity-matured immune response in the heavy-chain-only antibody classes. The nanobody gene repertoire was engineered in pMECS-GG phagemid, whereby a ccdB gene (encoding a lethal protein) was substituted by the nanobody gene. An immune nanobody library with approximately sixty-four million independent transformants was constructed, of which 100% contained an insert with the proper size of nanobody gene.
   Following phage display and biopanning, nine nanobodies that specifically recognise completely inactivated PPRV were identified on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   They showed superb potency in rapidly identifying PPRV, which is likely to open a new perspective in the diagnosis and possible treatment of PPR infection.

AB  - The Samoan swallowtail butterfly (Papilio godeffroyi) has become restricted to Tutuila Island, American Samoa. Factors driving its extirpation on other islands may be partly due to the availability and suitability of habitat, given the singular association we observed of P. godeffroyi with its host plant, Micromelum minutum. We expected that as a host plant specialist, P. godeffroyi might respond to variation in the physical traits and habitat context of M. minutum, which could help identify conservation opportunities throughout its present and former range. Because the ecology of P. godeffroyi is largely unknown, we conducted systematic surveys during 15 months in 2013 and 2014 on Tutuila to investigate its reproductive response to the physical and phenological variability of individual host trees and to the structural and geographical variability of the stands in which they occurred. We searched foliage for eggs, larvae, and pupae and monitored seasonal trends in herbivory and production of leaves, flowers, and fruits on 117 host trees in 8 rainforest stands, mostly within the National Park of American Samoa (NPSA), starting in March 2013 and ending in August 2014. We observed high variability in butterfly reproductive output between individual trees and stands, due largely to a strong negative relationship between leaf biomass (at both tree and stand levels) and oviposition density (number of eggs per foliar biomass) and frequency (number of eggs per survey). Distribution patterns of larvae and pupae were less distinct but generally followed trends in oviposition. Our findings indicate that the butterfly is reproducing widely across Tutuila and is likely to respond positively to management to increase the availability of small host trees in low-density stands. Thus, the species is a good candidate for conservation management focusing on habitat.

AB  - One of the most significant challenges for elephant conservation is managing negative interactions that occur where people and elephants use the same space and compete for resources. Human-elephant conflict (HEC) incidents often manifest as direct impacts to humans or elephants. However, some HEC situations result in long-term risk and chronic stress among communities living with elephants. Indirect impacts or opportunity costs, such as people being disadvantaged by the presence of elephants are harder to quantify and are not often addressed. In the eastern Okavango Panhandle, in northern Botswana, about 17,500 people share space and resources with 18,000 elephants in an area of 8,700 km2. Elephants here use distinct, historical corridors on a daily basis, moving from dryland resources to the wetlands of the Okavango Delta. Confrontations with elephants occur most frequently where these elephant corridors cross the main service road in the area, increasing fear among people walking to work, children going to school, parents sending children to school, and the elderly or expectant mothers accessing medical care. This constant fear contributes to chronic stress and can drive negative perceptions towards elephants. A novel intervention has been introduced to help reduce the costs of HEC and foster coexistence, in the Okavango Panhandle area-the 'Elephant Express'. The bus service was established through a multi-stakeholder collaboration to provide primary school children and medical personnel safe transport across elephant corridors to schools and health clinics. The complementary bus service has reduced stress from living with elephants, increased attendance and performance in schools, and facilitated improved access to medical care.

AB  - Context. Feral cats are a significant threat to wildlife in Australia and globally. Current feral cat management techniques have limitations that can result in wary, remnant individuals persisting in the landscape and reducing overall pest control efficacy, thus there is a need for additional innovative management techniques. Aims. This research aimed to identify whether the Mata Hari Judas technique could be applied to female cats (queens) in situ as a means of attracting and assisting the capture of feral cats. Methods. Three queens were induced into prolonged oestrus and contained in enclosures (vennels) in situ with traps attached to capture attracted feral cats. Two vennel treatments were trialled, one housing a Mata Hari Judas queen (queen vennel) and another using auditory and olfactory lures from a Mata Hari Judas queen (faux queen vennel) to compare the attractiveness of the two treatments at three study sites. Camera traps and soil plots were used to monitor and compare cat activity surrounding the vennels prior to, during and after the presence of a Mata Hari Judas queen or her lures. Key results. Both vennel treatments attracted multiple feral cats of both sexes, and each trapped one male cat, demonstrating proof of concept for this technique. The queen vennel was significantly more attractive than the faux queen vennel, as demonstrated by higher frequency of cat detections and the duration of time feral cats spent at this vennel. Comparisons between monitoring periods and when the vennels were active showed significant differences in the frequency of cats attracted to the area, further supporting that both the queen and her lures were attractive to cats. Conclusions. This research is the first instance where Mata Hari Judas queens have been successfully used in situ to attract and capture feral cats. Future studies should aim to assess this technique in a controlled area with a known cat population to allow for a direct comparison of efficacy with more traditional feral cat management methods. Implications. With further refinement, the use of Mata Hari Judas queens in situ could provide an efficient technique for removing remnant cats.

AB  - In the Russian Federation, the indigenous population of sika deer (Cervus nippon hortulorum, Swinhoe, 1864) lives only in a small area of the Primorsky Kray. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, along with measures for the conservation of sika deer, they began to acclimatize it, with settling over a large territory and creating new habitats. Currently, up to 40% of the total population of sika deer in the Russian Federation is concentrated in the European part. Despite the long period of existence in the new ecological conditions, molecular genetic methods were not used in the study of sika deer. This work presents for the first time the results of microsatellite analysis of two populations of sika deer from Tver (Zavidovo population) and Kaluga (Tarusa population) regions. F-statistics calculated for 12 STR-loci (BMS1788, Rt1, C143, OheQ, FCB193, C217, Rt24, C32, BMS745, NVHRT16, T40, C276) indicate a lack of heterozygous genotypes and indicate a weak divergence of populations. In the interpopulation comparison, the Zavidovo population was distinguished by a greater allelic diversity and a significant number of private alleles. Genetic variability in observed and expected heterozygosity for the Zavidovo population was HO= 0.47 +/- 0.08 and HE= 0.51 +/- 0.09 and for the Tarusa population - HO= 0.52 +/- 0.09 and HE= 0.49 +/- 0.08, respectively. At the same time, both studied populations of sika deer were characterized by a decrease in allelic diversity and heterozygosity relative to the "maternal" aboriginal Far Eastern population. Accordingly, at the present stage of hunting resource management, a reasonable artificial expansion of the range of rare and economically especially valuable animal species due to their dispersal and acclimatization is impos-sible without a genetic analysis of populations using highly polymorphic molecular markers and the use of standard estimated indicators of dynamic processes in populations. According to the results of the study, it can be concluded that the genetic diversity of the studied acclimatized populations of sika deer in the Tver and Kaluga regions does not differ significantly, and the observed difference in private alleles suggests an independent development of the gene pools of the populations under consideration.

AB  - Populations must continuously respond to environmental change or risk extinction. These responses can be measured as phenotypic rates of change, which allow researchers to predict their contemporary evolutionary responses. In 1999, a database of phenotypic rates of change in wild populations was compiled. Since then, researchers have used (and expanded) this database to examine the phenotypic responses as a function of the features of the study system (i.e., the population or set of populations, of a given species, that experienced a specific driver or disturbance), the measured traits, and methodological approaches. Therefore, PROCEED (Phenotypic Rates of Change Evolutionary and Ecological Database) is an ongoing compilation of rates of phenotypic change, typically calculated as Haldanes and Darwins, published in peer-reviewed literature (but also including data from theses and technical reports). Studies in this database measure the intraspecific change in quantitative (continuous or discrete) traits and report either the time elapsed from the onset of environmental novelty, or reference a historical or biological event reported in other sources (e.g., a mine opening or a well-documented biological invasion). Included studies either follow a single population through time (allochronic design) or compare two or more populations that diverged at a known time (synchronic design). Some included studies account for the total phenotypic variability in the field (i.e., phenotypic studies), while others employed common-garden or other quantitative genetic approaches to account for the heritable component of the phenotypic change (i.e., genetic studies). PROCEED includes systems in both natural and experimental conditions, provided that reproduction was not manipulated (i.e., artificial selection experiments were excluded). In the included experimental systems, the environment of the focal populations was manipulated (e.g., an herbivory exclusion experiment, where the type and load of herbivory are manipulated) but the studies did not deliberately select for trait values in the study population (e.g., the plant height). PROCEED does not include systems where the phenotypic change is presumably due to interspecific hybridization, polyploidy, or other chromosomal alterations. Here, we present the most recently updated PROCEED (Version 6.1). This new, curated version has 9263 records (n) collated from 326 studies, 1801 systems, and 428 species. The database includes records belonging to mammals (n = 686), birds (n = 1475), reptiles (n = 96), amphibians (n = 23), fishes (n = 3671), invertebrates (n = 1141, mostly arthropods), and plants (n = 2171). The maximum elapsed time between the environmental change and the sampling is 500 years but is typically less than 100 years (third quartile 89.5; median 45 years). The database also includes a set of variables describing biological and methodological aspects of the study system and measured traits, along with features of the sampling design in the primary source of information. This new version of PROCEED also includes a time series dataset comprising a subset of records included in the general dataset. These are allochronic studies with three or more sampling times throughout the entire study period. The time series dataset contains 655 time series (s)-belonging to 61 studies, from 156 systems, and 77 species-including mammals (s = 140), birds (s = 77), reptiles (s = 4), amphibians (s = 8), fishes (s = 404), and plants (s = 22).

AB  - As native ranges are often geographically structured, invasive species originating from a single source population only carry a fraction of the genetic diversity present in their native range. The invasion process is thus often associated with a drastic loss of genetic diversity resulting from a founder event. However, the fraction of diversity brought to the invasive range may vary under different invasion histories, increasing with the size of the propagule, the number of reintroduction events, and/or the total genetic diversity represented by the various source populations in a multiple-introduction scenario. In this study, we generated a SNP data set for the invasive termite Reticulitermes flavipes from 23 native populations in the eastern United States and six introduced populations throughout the world. Using population genetic analyses and approximate Bayesian computation random forest, we investigated its worldwide invasion history. We found a complex invasion pathway with multiple events out of the native range and bridgehead introductions from the introduced population in France. Our data suggest that extensive long-distance jump dispersal appears common in both the native and introduced ranges of this species, probably through human transportation. Overall, our results show that similar to multiple introduction events into the invasive range, admixture in the native range prior to invasion can potentially favour invasion success by increasing the genetic diversity that is later transferred to the introduced range.

AB  - There is growing recognition of the threat posed by toxic lead-based ammunition. One group of domestic animals known to be susceptible to harmful lead exposure via this route is hunting dogs. Scent-trailing dogs ('hounds') are used to hunt introduced sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) during a prescribed eight-month (April-November) annual hunting season, during which they are fed fresh venison, in Victoria, south-eastern Australia. We used this annual season as a natural experiment to undertake longitudinal sampling of dogs for lead exposure. Blood was collected from 27 dogs owned by four different deer hunters and comprising three different breeds just prior to the start of the hound hunting season (March 2022) and in the middle of the season (August 2022), and blood lead levels (BLLs) (mu g/dL) were determined via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Using Tobit regression, the expected BLLs across all dogs were significantly lower before the season (0.50 mu g/dL, standard error [SE] = 0.32 mu g/dL) than during the season (1.39 mu g/dL, SE = 0.35 mu g/dL) (p = 0.01). However, when the breed of dog was included in the analyses, this effect was only significant in beagles (P < 0.001), not bloodhounds (p = 0.73) or harriers (p = 0.43). For 32% of the dogs before the season, and 56% during the season, BLLs exceeded the established threshold concentration for developmental neurotoxicity in humans (1.2 mu g/dL). Time since most recent venison feeding, sex of dog and owner were not associated with BLLs. The finding that BLLs more than doubled during the hunting season indicates that lead exposure is a risk in this context. These results expand the sphere of impact from environmental lead in Australia from wild animals and humans, to include some groups of domestic animals, a textbook example of a One Health issue.

AB  - IntroductionAtlantic bluefin tuna (ABT) are large, migratory pelagic predators of high economic importance. ABT are currently managed as two independent stocks assigned to discrete spawning areas (Gulf of Mexico, and Mediterranean); however, stock overlap outside spawning areas makes accurate assignment of catch to stock-of-origin difficult. MethodsWithin this two-stock paradigm, we characterised stock-specific spatial distributions and behaviours by comparing habitat usage and vertical movement behaviours of 118 electronically tagged adult ABT spatially assigned to the GOM and Med spawning grounds. These spatial and behavioural differences were used in tests to probabilistically assign unknown individuals (which did not visit the GOM/Med spawning areas) to a stock. ResultsThis new methodological approach using existing tag data, enables increased assignment of a track to a potential stock, to be achieved before genetic assignments. We identified certain markedly different movement patterns, range extents, depth use preferences (and associated area usage), migration directness and speeds, corresponding distance from shore, and mesopelagic-layer visitation. The probabilistic assignment approach had 97% in-bag testing accuracy, then assigned 190 individuals to a stock, doubling the number of assigned stock-of-origin tracks in our dataset, and potentially revealing novel movement and behaviour patterns among pre-spawning-age ABT. DiscussionThis approach can be easily adapted to other study species, more stocks, and different testing variables, hopefully serving as a useful addition to the fisheries management toolkit.

AB  - Predation establishes risk, which can indirectly influence prey behavior and ecology. We evaluated the influence of Mexican gray wolves (Canis lupus baileyi) on habitat selection and spatiotemporal predator avoidance strategies of elk (Cervus canadensis). We fit 866 adult female elk with GPS collars across areas of varying wolf densities within the Mexican wolf experimental population area of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico between 2019-2021. Using step-selection functions we examined relative intensity of elk use in relation to landscape attributes, estimated predator/prey diel activity, and measures of risk. Risk metrics included predicted wolf presence, habitat openness, and predicted risky places modeled from attributes of locations where wolves killed elk. Wolf activity varied across seasons and increased midday and night in fall and monsoon seasons. Relative use by elk was best explained by incorporating an interaction between diel period and predicted risky places across all seasons. Elk utilized risky places more in times of nutritional deficit associated with high energetic demands of the third trimester pregnancy and lactation and when forage quality was best, during spring and monsoon season. Particularly, use of risky places increased at less risky times in areas with more established wolf presence, suggesting use of risky places varied relative to exposure to Mexican wolves. These behaviors highlight the importance of temporal avoidance when predators and prey are highly mobile and largely overlap in space. Our research suggests temporally responding to predictable and relatively static environmental characteristics associated with encounter and kill rates may better balance energetic trade-offs than anticipating changes in wolf activity or spatially avoiding areas with higher wolf presence. Thus, elk appear to be more willing to take chances and mitigate cursorial predation risk with a more immediate, reactive approach and make proactive trade-offs during the seasons they can best increase fitness.

AB  - The growing world population, combined with scarcities of agricultural land, water, forest, fisheries, and biodiversity resources, makes it necessary to search for alternative sources of nutrients. For this reason, in recent years, edible insects have been introduced into the diet, even in areas where entomophagy is not traditional. In light of this, the present study aims at characterizing the aromatic profile of three edible insects flours: cricket (Acheta domesticus, CP), buffalo worm (Alphitobius diaperinus, BW), and mealworm (Tenebrio molitor, MW). This goal has been achieved by means of an (HS)-SPME/GC-MS strategy. 67 compounds have been tentatively identified; of these, 27 are present only in the CP and BW flours, while 10 are common in all three flours. The compound with the highest peak's relative area in gas chromatograms of CP and BW flours is hexadecanoic acid, while in MW it is 1-heptylpyrrolidin-2-one. In general, we have observed that CP and BW flours have 37 compounds in common, and their volatile compositions along with their profiles are more similar to each other than to MW profile.

TI  - Early depictions of the first Lisbon rhinoceros in the 16th century
T2  - PACHYDERM
LA  - English
AB  - The first post-Roman rhinoceros to be seen alive in Europe reached the harbour of Lisbon, Portugal on 20 May 1515. After a fight with an elephant staged on 3 June 1515, King Dom Manuel I 'the Fortunate' decided to gift the rhino to Pope Leo X in Rome. The animal drowned when the vessel was shipwrecked in a storm off La Spezia in northern Italy at the end of January 1516. Information and a sketch reached the German city of Nuremberg, where Albrecht D & uuml;rer proceeded to make a drawing with text dated 1515, followed by a woodcut of the Lisbon Rhinoceros. D & uuml;rer's works show a characteristic twisted horn in the shoulder region, found in all later copies, which became the standard representation of the rhinoceros from 1545, in books and artworks. During the first part of the 16th century, until about 1560, there were at least 16 works which showed a rhinoceros without this D & uuml;rer-hornlet. These would have been sketches of the living animal during its short life in Europe, or possibly been derived from such portrayals. Five of such works have remained largely unknown, and are here described, discussed and illustrated. First, there is a set of similar engravings found in three separate Cartinhas (booklets) produced in Portugal between 1534- 1544 by the printer Germ & atilde;o Galharde, where the animal is uniquely named "Rhinocerom", noted here in zoological context for the first time. Second, two similar figures of a rhinoceros on the cover of a pamphlet published by the Italian author Giovanni Giacomo Penni and seen in the background of a large painting by Francesco Granacci of 1515-1516, might both be based on a coloured unsigned sketch found in a volume of manuscripts held in the Library of the Vatican (Vat. lat. 2847). Third, the Historia Senensium by Sigismondo Tizio contains a sketch of a rhinoceros in shackles in an entry for 1515. Fourth, a rhinoceros is found among marginal drawings and manuscript annotations added to a volume of Pliny's Natural History. Finally, a book on Quadrupeds published by Michael Herr in 1546 has an independent illustration of a rhinoceros without a hornlet on the shoulders and was copied in books by Hubert de L'Espine of 1558 and Barth & eacute;lemy Aneau of 1549. All examples are illustrated for future comparison.

FX  - We dedicate this short paper to Hermann Walter (b. 1934) , who retired from the University of Mannheim, where he specialized in Roman Grammar and Mythographie. He came across rhinoceros' depictions in the course of his original research in Italian libraries, museums and buildings. These were the subject of a small number of incisive papers, which deserve to be better known. Walter and KR corresponded for several years in the 1990s and 2000s, exchanging ideas and information on rhinoceros iconography. Through his intensive and informed research, the iconography of the rhinoceros has made some great leaps helping to build a better understanding of the historical events. In our search of early Ganda images, we were greatly assisted by the specialists and librarians in Portugal: Helga Maria Justen, bibliographic researcher in Lisbon; Zelia Parreira, Director, Biblioteca Publica de Evora; and Maria de Fatima Bogalho, General Library of the University of Coimbra. We thank Annemarie Jordan Gschwend for reading an early draft and providing information on her forthcoming paper. Many of the older books, drawings and manuscripts can now be consulted online, thanks to the invaluable efforts of the world's museums and libraries to digitize their holdings. We are grateful to these institutions who have allowed us to reproduce the artwork in their care. The Rhino Resource Center (RRC) is sponsored by SOS Rhino and IRF-International Rhino Foundation.

AB  - We investigated the possibility of single-step genome editing in small ruminants by CRISPR-Cas9 zygote electroporation. We targeted SOCS2 and PDX1 in sheep embryos and OTX2 in goat embryos, utilizing a dual sgRNA approach. Gene editing efficiency was compared between microinjection and three different electroporation settings performed at four different times of embryo development. Electroporation of sheep zygotes 6 h after fertilization with settings that included short high-voltage (poring) and long low-voltage (transfer) pulses was efficient at producing SOCS2 knock-out blastocysts. The mutation rate after CRISPR/Cas9 electroporation was 95.6% +/- 8%, including 95.4% +/- 9% biallelic mutations; which compared favorably to 82.3% +/- 8% and 25% +/- 10%, respectively, when using microinjection. We also successfully disrupted the PDX1 gene in sheep and the OTX2 gene in goat embryos. The biallelic mutation rate was 81 +/- 5% for PDX1 and 85% +/- 6% for OTX2. In conclusion, using single-step CRISPR-Cas9 zygote electroporation, we successfully introduced biallelic deletions in the genome of small ruminant embryos.

AB  - Wheat, a major global cereal crop, is prone to quality degradation from early sprouting when stored improperly, resulting in substantial economic losses. Traditional methods for detecting early sprouting are labor-intensive and destructive, underscoring the need for rapid, non-destructive alternatives. Terahertz (THz) technology provides a promising solution due to its ability to perform non-invasive imaging of internal structures. However, current THz imaging techniques are limited by low image resolution, which restricts their practical application. We address these challenges by proposing an advanced deep learning framework for THz image classification of early sprouting wheat. We first develop an Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (AESRGAN) to improve the resolution of THz images, integrating an attention mechanism to focus on critical image regions. This model achieves a 0.76 dB improvement in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Subsequently, we introduce the EfficientViT-based YOLO V8 classification model, incorporating a Depthwise Separable Attention (C2F-DSA) module, and further optimize the model using the Gazelle Optimization Algorithm (GOA). Experimental results demonstrate the GOA-EViTDSA-YOLO model achieves an accuracy of 97.5% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.962. The model is efficient and significantly enhances the classification of early sprouting wheat compared to other deep learning models.

AB  - Simple Summary Cashmere goats are valuable genetic resources which are famous for their high-quality fiber. Runs of homozygosity (ROHs) refer to uninterrupted sequences of homozygous genotypes present within the DNA sequence of an individual. To enhance the preservation, improvement and enduring utilization of this valuable genetic resource, we performed a comprehensive study on the genetic variance, degree of inbreeding, patterns of ROHs and selected genes situated in ROH islands which are associated with economic attributes in goats via whole-genome sequencing analysis. Our research showed that the Inner Mongolia cashmere goat possesses a notably high level of genetic diversity and presented the lowest inbreeding coefficient. On the contrary, the highest Froh and lowest levels of diversity were observed in wild goats compared to domesticated goats. The analysis of selection signal through ROHs identified some genes related to meat, fiber and milk production; fertility, disease and cold resistance and adaptability; and body size and growth.Abstract Cashmere goats are valuable genetic resources which are famous worldwide for their high-quality fiber. Runs of homozygosity (ROHs) have been identified as an efficient tool to assess inbreeding level and identify related genes under selection. However, there is limited research on ROHs in cashmere goats. Therefore, we investigated the ROH pattern, assessed genomic inbreeding levels and examined the candidate genes associated with the cashmere trait using whole-genome resequencing data from 123 goats. Herein, the Inner Mongolia cashmere goat presented the lowest inbreeding coefficient of 0.0263. In total, we identified 57,224 ROHs. Seventy-four ROH islands containing 50 genes were detected. Certain identified genes were related to meat, fiber and milk production (FGF1, PTPRM, RERE, GRID2, RARA); fertility (BIRC6, ECE2, CDH23, PAK1); disease or cold resistance and adaptability (PDCD1LG2, SVIL, PRDM16, RFX4, SH3BP2); and body size and growth (TMEM63C, SYN3, SDC1, STRBP, SMG6). 135 consensus ROHs were identified, and we found candidate genes (FGF5, DVL3, NRAS, KIT) were associated with fiber length or color. These findings enhance our comprehension of inbreeding levels in cashmere goats and the genetic foundations of traits influenced by selective breeding. This research contributes significantly to the future breeding, reservation and use of cashmere goats and other goat breeds.

AB  - Simple Summary Insects, including dung beetles, rely on volatile cues to locate food and mates. However, the antennal responses of dung beetles to dung headspace volatiles have received minimal attention. To address this gap, we conducted a scanning electron microscopy study to examine the density distribution of three types of antennal sensilla in three introduced dung beetle species found in Australia: Geotrupes spiniger, Bubas bison and Onitis aygulus. The gross morphology of the antennal sensilla of these species is described here for the first time. Notably, we observed distinct patterns of sensilla trichodea, sensilla basiconica and sensilla chaetica on the proximal and distal surfaces of three lamellae in their antennal clubs. Furthermore, using electroantennography, we investigated the olfactory responses of these dung beetles to ten selected dung volatiles and mixtures of the same volatiles. The test chemicals evoked differential antennal responses in all three test species. The results are discussed in relation to the distribution and density of the antennal sensilla and the potential role of dung headspace volatiles in dung preference by these dung beetles. Overall, our findings indicate the possibility of using EAG-active compounds to attract dung beetles in the field. Locating sporadically distributed food resources and mate finding are strongly aided by volatile cues for most insects, including dung beetles. However, there is limited information on the olfactory ecology of dung beetles. We conducted a scanning electron microscopy study on the morphology and distribution of the antennal sensilla of three introduced dung beetle species in Australia: Geotrupes spiniger (Coleoptera: Geotrupidae), Bubas bison and Onitis aygulus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae). Three main morphological types of antennal sensilla were identified: sensilla trichodea (ST), sensilla basiconica (SB) and sensilla chaetica (SCh). Distinct variations of SB distribution were observed in B. bison and G. spiniger and on different lamellar surfaces in both sexes of all three species. Sexual dimorphism in antennal sensilla distribution or their abundance was not evident. To complement the morphological characterisation of sensilla, electroantennography (EAG) was carried out to construct EAG response profiles of the three species to selected dung volatiles. An initial study revealed that antennae of all species were sensitive to a mix of phenol, skatole, indole, p-cresol, butanone and butyric acid, common components of livestock dung headspace. In addition to these six compounds, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, eucalyptol and toluene were tested for antennal activity. All compounds evoked measurable EAG responses, confirming antennal sensitivity. Geotrupes spiniger exhibited significant responses to all the compounds compared to the control, whereas B. bison and O. aygulus only responded to a subset of compounds. A comparison of relative EAG amplitudes revealed highly significant responses to p-cresol in G. spiniger and to skatole in B. bison. Geotrupes spiniger displayed differential responses to all the compounds. Pooled EAG data suggest highly significant differences in responses among the three species and among compounds. Our findings suggest that a blend of volatiles may offer potential for the trapping of dung beetles, thereby avoiding the use of dung baits that are inconvenient, inconsistent and may pose a threat to farm biosecurity.

AB  - Plants typically experience great losses from their reproductive potential represented by ovule production to the post-dispersal crop of viable seed. We examined seed density and viability in a founder population of mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa), aiming to quantify losses at different stages and examine potential selection forces on the reproduction success of the founder generation of an isolated population. At the time of the study (2017-2020), the population had recently reached reproductive maturity, following its colonization around 1990 through long-distance dispersal onto an early successional outwash plain in southeast Iceland. Seed densities were high, but 89% of apparently intact seeds did not contain an embryo, despite being visually indistinguishable from filled seeds. Externally evident losses amounted to about 45% of the total seed crop and were mostly due to predation by the gall midge Semudobia betulae. When all losses were accounted for, 2.7% of the seed crop remained viable and germinated. Pollen limitation may partially explain the high incidence of empty seeds. Excessive flower production is compatible with the predator satiation hypothesis but cannot explain pre-dispersal losses. Another adaptation to predation, masting, appears poorly developed in Iceland. Our results suggest the presence of constraints on the reproduction potential of the new island population, that are more limiting than in neighbouring populations, and we discuss their developmental, ecological, and environmental correlates.

AB  - Context. For plant species that have evolved in fire-prone environments, declines after wildfires are often driven by the combination of fire and other threatening processes. Mitigating the impacts of these threatening processes can sometimes effectively support post-fire population recovery. Aims. We test the effectiveness of: (1) phosphite application to mitigate Phytophthora dieback; (2) fencing to exclude browsing by mammalian herbivores; and (3) translocation to sites where threats can be practically managed, for conservation of threatened flora affected by wildfires in 2018 and 2019 in the Stirling Range (Koi Kyeunu-ruff), south-western Australia. Methods. Survival of Phytophthora-susceptible flora was compared in repeatedly sampled plots from prior to and after wildfire and +/- recurrent phosphite application. Survival and growth of browsing-susceptible flora was compared post-fire in fenced and control plots. Survival, growth and flowering was compared between wild populations recruiting after wildfire and translocated populations. Key results. Phosphite application increased survival of most Phytophthora-susceptible flora. Fencing led to greater growth and often increased survival. Translocated populations, with supplemental water, had greater growth rates and earlier flowering than wild populations, and a non-significant trend for higher survival. Conclusions These findings provide strong evidence supporting continuation of phosphite application, herbivore exclusion and translocation for post-fire recovery of the threatened flora of the Stirling Range. Implications. With increasing wildfire extent, frequency and impact across the globe, successful management of non-fire threats will be crucial for post-fire conservation of threatened flora, with the approaches proving effective in this study likely to have conservation value elsewhere.

AB  - Males in many species engage in physical combat over access to mates, and sexual selection has led to the evolution of weapons to enhance contest performance. The size of these often-elaborate structures is known to be exquisitely sensitive to nutrition. However, we know very little about the degree to which nutrition affects other attributes of animal weapons that can be crucial to fighting. In this study, we investigated the impact of natural dietary variation on weapon structural integrity in a fighting insect, Narnia femorata (Hemiptera: Coreidae). Males in this species display their enlarged, spiny hind legs to other males, and these legs serve as weapons in aggressive physical contests where they are used to strike and squeeze opponents. N. femorata feeds on the fruit of prickly pear cactus and sets up territories on this plant. In North Central Florida the prickly pear Opuntia mesacantha ssp. lata blooms and begins to produce fruits in April and May. N. femorata has multiple, overlapping generations while the green fruits slowly ripen over the next several months. We examined insects reaching adulthood at two nearby time points in this range, June and July, to test the influence of the nutrition provided by ripening green cactus fruit on weapon size and its ability to resist puncture. We also raised insects on cactus with red, ripe fruit for comparison. We found a striking effect of cactus fruit phenology on weapons. Insects raised with the more mature green fruit (those in the second cohort) had 71% larger weapon area and 4.4 times greater puncture resistance than those raised on the early green fruit (those in the first cohort). In contrast, insects raised on red, ripe fruit were moderate in size, had high puncture resistance, and they changed little phenotypically from the first to second cohort. Increased structural integrity of the hind femur weapon was associated with the increased body size that came with better nutrition. This pattern highlights that cuticle thickness increased or its material properties changed when weapons were larger. Importantly, effects of nutrition on puncture resistance also transcended size. Insects of the same size had greater structural integrity if they received superior nutrition. Sexually selected weapons are often used as visual signals to conspecifics before fights, and this work hints that the size of the weapons may be a poor signal of weapon performance when nutrition is variable.

AB  - The holotype of the Tenerife (Canary Islands) giant rat, Canariomys bravoi, an almost complete cranium from the Late Pleistocene site of Cueva de las Palomas, is described for the first time. This species is characterized by its large size, robust skull with a short rostrum, dorsal inflation at the level of the infraorbital foramen, and moderately high-crowned upper molars which develop partial stephanodonty at advanced wear stages. Canariomys tamarani from Gran Canaria Island, the only other species of this genus known so far, is slightly smaller and further differs in its higher crowned molars with cusps arranged in a lamellar pattern. However, their crania are remarkedly similar and present a distinctive anatomy of the zygomatic plate, which is very high on the rostrum, so that its dorsal border is nearly on level with the zygomatic process of the maxilla instead of considerably below it as usually seen in murines. This is also observed in other insular, often large-sized, murines but certainly evolved in parallel as an adaptation to herbivory. Molar morphology is congruent with recent analyses of ancient molecular data of C. bravoi which place it in the tribe Arvicanthini (mostly African murines), more concretely within the Arvicanthis niloticus species complex. Even though genetic data indicate that both species diverged very recently, just 650,000 years ago, cranial and dental anatomy of C. bravoi are very derived. Conversely, C. tamarani presents a molar morphology reminiscent of that of A. niloticus albeit associated with a similarly highly derived cranial anatomy.

AB  - Nestboxes have been deployed for parrots and cockatoos (Psittaciformes) worldwide, but there is limited evidence of their efficacy for these species. We examined the use of nestboxes by endangered South Australian Glossy Black Cockatoos Calyptorhynchus lathami halmaturinus, a habitat specialist that feeds almost solely on the seeds of Drooping Sheoak Allocasuarina verticillata trees, and investigated the factors that influenced nestbox use. Between 1998 and 2017, the mean annual proportion of nesting attempts that successfully fledged a chick was similar in nestboxes (52%, n = 547) and natural hollows (53%, n = 627). Nestbox use increased over time, which may reflect changes in the size and extent of the Glossy Black Cockatoo population over the study period. Nestboxes were more likely to be used by Glossy Black Cockatoos if they were close to the nest of another breeding pair and were not occupied by Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoos Zanda funerea early in the breeding season. Nestboxes were also more likely to be used if they had been used in the previous breeding season, indicating nest-site fidelity. The amount of A. verticillata feeding habitat in a 1-km and 5-km radius did not significantly influence nestbox use. Our study provides further evidence of the value of nestboxes to cockatoo conservation programmes, but also suggests that multiple factors other than local food availability influence uptake by a target species. Given that Glossy Black Cockatoos prefer to aggregate their nests, nestboxes for this species are most likely to be beneficial when they are used to expand the capacity of existing breeding areas or are clustered in the landscape. Our study demonstrates that well-designed nestbox deployments should consider the preferred social groupings of cockatoos during the breeding season, and the location of competitor species, in order to maximize nestbox uptake.

AB  - Generally, floral characteristics and pollination are important factors enhancing the quality and quantity of reproductive output for regeneration in plant conservation. However, lack of evidence-based management could decrease fitness under ex-situ conservation. We investigated the capitulum and pollination characteristics of Eriocaulon heleocharioides Satake (Eriocaulaceae), which is extinct in the wild, to develop an evidence-based conservation management plan incorporating previously ignored reproductive characteristics.
   To evaluate the functional characteristics of capitula, pollen-ovule ratio, and reproductive status (maximum pollination success/florivory damage) were investigated along six flowering sequences of capitulum. To evaluate the effect of plant density on pollen transfer, high- and low-density plots were established. Total deposited pollen on stigma, insect visitation, and visit duration per capitulum were observed.
   A significantly lower pollen-ovule ratio was observed in the first of six capitula, reflecting higher female functionality. The highest pollination success was found in the second-fourth capitula, whereas florivory increased along the terminal capitula position. High plant density affected the pollen deposited on stigmas via insect visitation and low pollinator visit duration.
   Different capitula in E. heleocharioides could have different effects: different sexual functionality, enhancement of reproductive output both in quality and quantity through active pollen transfer, and escaping from florivores. High plant density could facilitate outcross-pollen transfer in E. heleocharioides. Multiple perspectives are important for determining potential reproductive success in ex-situ conservation. Thus, density management reflecting capitulum characteristics could improve the efficiency of conservation efforts for E. heleocharioides.

AB  - Simple Summary African swine fever (ASF) has caused significant damage to wildlife and domestic pig production. Since the first confirmed case in South Korea, the number of infected wild boars has continued to increase despite various management operations. Hence, this study developed the ASF expansion model based on an agent-based modeling approach to simulate management strategies for assessing the effective control of ASF. In our model, the agents' (wild boars) behavior and daily movement range based on their ecological and behavioral characteristics by applying annual hunting scenarios from the past three years (2019.09-2022.08). Our results represented that the higher the hunting intensity, the smaller the ASF expansion area (24,987 km(2) at 0% annual hunting rate; 3533 km(2) at 70%). Furthermore, the complete removal of agents during the simulation period was shown to be possible through the annual hunting rate above 70%. In conclusion, an annual hunting intensity of 70% is needed to control ASF effectively. African swine fever (ASF) is a viral hemorrhagic fever fatal to animals of the Suidae family. It has spread from Africa to Europe and Asia, causing significant damage to wildlife and domesticated pig production. Since the first confirmed case in South Korea in September 2019, the number of infected wild boars has continued to increase, despite quarantine fences and hunting operations. Hence, new strategies are needed for the effective control of ASF. We developed an agent-based model (ABM) to estimate the ASF expansion area and the efficacy of infection control strategies. In addition, we simulated the agents' (wild boars) behavior and daily movement range based on their ecological and behavioral characteristics, by applying annual hunting scenarios from past three years (2019.09-2022.08). The results of the simulation based on the annual changes in the number of infected agents and the ASF expansion area showed that the higher the hunting intensity, the smaller the expansion area (24,987 km(2) at 0% vs. 3533 km(2) at 70%); a hunting intensity exceeding 70% minimally affected the expansion area. A complete removal of agents during the simulation period was shown to be possible. In conclusion, an annual hunting intensity of 70% should be maintained to effectively control ASF.

AB  - Food habits of eight insectivorous bat species from Puting Bato Cave Complex, Polillo Island, were examined. Fecal samples collected from eight species of cave-dwelling insectivorous bats contained culled fragments from seven prey taxa (six insect orders and one fish prey). Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Hymenoptera were the most consumed group in both percentage volume and percentage frequency. The diet of Hipposideros diadema, H. pygmaeus, Rhinolophus arcuatus, and R. philippinensis mostly concurs with previous studies but with varying proportions. Baseline information on the diets of H. coronatus, M. paululus, R. macrotis, and R. rufus is provided in this study.(c) 2023 National Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA), Publishing Services by Elsevier.

AB  - Central European forests have been shaped by complex human interactions throughout the Holocene, with significant changes following the introduction of domesticated animals in the Neolithic (similar to 7.5-6.0 ka before present [BP]). However, understanding early pastoral practices and their impact on forests is limited by methods for detecting animal movement across past landscapes. Here, we examine ancient sedimentary DNA (sedaDNA) preserved at the Velky Mamutak rock shelter in northern Bohemia (Czech Republic), which has been a forested enclave since the early Holocene. We find that domesticated animals, their associated microbiomes, and plants potentially gathered for fodder have clear representation by the Late Neolithic, around 6.0 ka BP, and persist throughout the Bronze Age into recent times. We identify a change in dominant grazing species from sheep to pigs in the Bronze Age (similar to 4.1-3.0 ka BP) and interpret the impact this had in the mid-Holocene retrogressions that still define the structure of Central European forests today. This study highlights the ability of ancient metagenomics to bridge archaeological and paleoecological methods and provide an enhanced perspective on the roots of the "Anthropocene."

AB  - Introduction: Rice heavily relies on nitrogen fertilizers, posing environmental, resource, and geopolitical challenges. This study explores sustainable alternatives like animal manure and remote sensing for resource-efficient rice cultivation. It aims to assess the long-term impact of organic fertilization and remote sensing monitoring on agronomic traits, yield, and nutrition.Methods: A six-year experiment in rice fields evaluated fertilization strategies, including pig slurry (PS) and chicken manure (CM) with mineral fertilizers (MIN), MIN-only, and zero-fertilization. Traits, yield, spectral responses, and nutrient content were measured. Sentinel-2 remote sensing tracked crop development.Results: Cost-effective organic fertilizers (PS and CM) caused a 13% and 15% yield reduction but still doubled zero-fertilization yield. PS reduced nitrogen leaching. Heavy metals in rice grains were present at safe amounts. Organic-fertilized crops showed nitrogen deficiency at the late vegetative stages, affecting yield. Sentinel-2 detected nutrient deficiencies through NDVI.Discussion: Organic fertilizers, especially PS, reduce nitrogen loss, benefiting the environment. However, they come with yield trade-offs and nutrient management challenges that can be managed and balanced with reduced additional mineral applications. Sentinel-2 remote sensing helps manage nutrient deficiencies. In summary, this research favors cost-effective organic fertilizers with improved nutrient management for sustainable rice production.

AB  - Peninsular bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) are found exclusively in Southern California and Baja Mexico. They are federally endangered due to multiple threats, including introduced infectious disease. From 1981 to 2017, we conducted surveillance for 16 pathogens and estimated population sizes, adult survival, and lamb survival. We used mixed effects regression models to assess disease patterns at the individual and population levels. Pathogen infection/exposure prevalence varied both spatially and temporally. Our findings indicate that the primary predictor of individual pathogen infection/exposure was the region in which an animal was captured, implying that transmission is driven by local ecological or behavioral factors. Higher Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae seropositivity was associated with lower lamb survival, consistent with lambs having high rates of pneumonia-associated mortality, which may be slowing population recovery. There was no association between M. ovipneumoniae and adult survival. Adult survival was positively associated with population size and parainfluenza-3 virus seroprevalence in the same year, and orf virus seroprevalence in the previous year. Peninsular bighorn sheep are recovering from small population sizes in a habitat of environmental extremes, compounded by infectious disease. Our research can help inform future pathogen surveillance and population monitoring for the long-term conservation of this population.

AB  - This paper presents the first application of mammal tooth enamel carbonate stable isotope analysis for the purpose of investigating late Pleistocene-early Holocene environmental change in an Australian archaeological context. Stable carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope ratios were analyzed from archaeological and modern spectacled hare wallaby (Lagorchestes conspicillatus) and hill kangaroo (Osphranter robustus) tooth enamel carbonates from Boodie Cave on Barrow Island in Western Australia. delta O-18 results track the dynamic paleoecological history at Boodie Cave including a clear shift towards increasing aridity preceding the onset of the Last Glacial Maximum and a period of increased humidity in the early to mid-Holocene. Enamel delta C-13 reflects divergent species feeding ecology and may imply a long-term shift toward increasing diversity in vegetation structure. This study contributes new data to the carbonate-isotope record for Australian fauna and demonstrates the significant potential of stable isotope based ecological investigations for tracking paleoenvironment change to inter-strata resolution.

AB  - Conventional microsatellite (simple sequence repeat, SSR) genotyping methods cannot accurately identify polyploid genotypes leading to allele dosage uncertainty, introducing biases in population genetic analysis. Here, a new SSR genotyping method was developed to directly infer accurate polyploid genotypes. The frequency distribution of SSR sequences was obtained based on deep-coverage high-throughput sequencing data. Corrections were performed accounting for the "stutter peak" and amplification efficiency of SSR sequences. Perl scripts and an online SSR genotyping tool "SSRSeq" were provided to process the sequencing data and output genotypes with corrected allele dosages. Hexaploid Camellia oleifera is the dominant woody oilseed crop in China. Understanding the geographical pattern of genetic variation in wild C. oleifera is essential for the conservation and utilization of genetic resources. Six wild C. oleifera populations were sampled across geographical ranges in subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests of China. Using 35 SSR markers, the high-throughput sequencing-based SSRSeq method was applied to obtain accurate hexaploid genotypes of wild C. oleifera. The results demonstrated that the new method could resolve allele dosage uncertainty and considerably improve genetic diversity, structure and differentiation analyses for polyploids. The genetic variation patterns of wild C. oleifera across geographical ranges agree with the "central-marginal hypothesis", stating that genetic diversity is high in the central population and declines from the central to the peripheral populations, and genetic differentiation increases from the centre to the periphery. This method and findings can facilitate the utilization of wild C. oleifera genetic resources for the breeding of cultivated C. oleifera.

AB  - In Germany, the high risk of wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) is further increasing due to increasing traffic volumes and road densities as well as the growing population densities of common ungulate species. As a result, threats to human health and property as well as wildlife mortality of widely spread and rare species increase. Currently, three basic types of wildlife fences are used in Germany: type A, a conventional galvanized-high tensile deer fence (made of knot braid); type B, a chain wire (mesh wire) fence; type C, a rigid welded wire mesh fence panels. Since fencing needs to restrict access of many different species with different behaviours (e.g. jumping, climbing, digging), fencing needs to be multifaceted to be effectively. Furthermore, the occurrence of wildlife species with habits such as jumping, climbing or digging determines the optimal (functional) fence design per location. We surveyed road managers in combination with a personal assessment of road sections in Germany and derived the following recommendations for optimal fencing to reduce WVC: 1) To deter digging, use plates made of recycled synthetic materials or a concrete foundation, instead of barbed wire. 2) Fencing should be made of chain wire (mesh wire, type B) fence or rigid welded wire mesh fence panels (type C) instead of knot braid mesh (type A). 3) To restrict climbing, use angled chain wire fence or rigid welded wire mesh fence panels at the top of the fences. 4) Maintain fences so that they are kept free from ingrown vegetation/woods. Maintenance conditions should be considered while planning and building the fence, especially to ensure sufficient space on both sides for accessibility. 5) Fencing should be established preferably near the roadside and moved away from property lines. In conclusion, wildlife fencing could be a very effective mitigation measure to prevent WVC with common as well as protected species, when proper designed and recommendations of the survey will be consequently considered. Currently many wildlife fences lack functionality due to an inappropriate design and maintenance issues in Germany.

AB  - Biological invasions are considered a significant challenge both from an ecological and economical perspective. Compared to the native range, environmental conditions in the invasive range often favor more competitive genotypes. Little attention, however, has so far been paid to the possibility that these invasive and competitive genotypes might also be back-introduced into a species' native range, where they could trigger a problematic increase in abundance or expansion. The frequency with which this occurs in the species ' native range might be an underestimated aspect in nature conservation. We transplanted native and invasive individuals of the biennial model species Jacobaea vulgaris into field sites of naturally occurring populations within the species' native range. The aim was to test whether back-introduced invasive origins show decreased performance, e.g., because of the reunion with specialized herbivores or plant-soil-feedbacks or whether they have the potential to trigger problematic population dynamics in the species' native range. We ran an additional greenhouse experiment to specifically address soil-borne effects in the species' native habitats. We found that invasive individuals generally outperformed the native transplants if compared in the field sites. By contrast, there were no origin-dependent differences in the greenhouse experiment. Our findings clearly indicate that testing for origin effects exclusively under controlled conditions might underestimate the potential of invasive genotypes to trigger invasion processes in habitats of the species' native range. Although differences in performance mediated by soil-borne effects were not associated with plant origin, field site susceptibility to J. vulgaris colonization varied largely. Identifying the exact factors driving these differences, offers another focal point to minimize the risk of a detrimental increase in the abundance or expansion of this highly invasive species in its home range.

AB  - Stress experienced during ontogeny can have profound effects on the adult phenotype. However, stress can also be experienced intergenerationally, where an offspring's phenotype can be moulded by stress experienced by the parents. Although early-life and intergenerational stress can alter anatomy, physiology, and behaviour, nothing is known about how these stress contexts interact to affect the neural phenotype. Here, we examined how early-life and intergenerational stress affect the brain in eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus). Some lizard populations co-occur with predatory fire ants, and stress from fire ant attacks exerts intergenerational physiological and behavioural changes in lizards. However, it is unclear if intergenerational stress, or the interaction between intergenerational and early-life stress, modulates the brain. To test this, we captured gravid females from fire ant invaded and uninvaded populations, and subjected offspring to three early-life stress treatments: (1) fire ant attack, (2) corticosterone, or (3) a control. Corticosterone and fire ant attack decreased some aspects of the neural phenotype while population of origin and the interaction of early-life stress and population had no effects on the brain. These results suggest that early-life stressors may better predict adult brain variation than intergenerational stress in this species.

AB  - Simple Summary Biosecurity breaches have been shown to play a major role in the introduction and spread of African swine fever (ASF) in domestic pig populations. The aim of the study was to describe the biosecurity levels and management practices of ASF outbreak and uninfected herds and to identify potential risk factors for ASF introduction. The biosecurity score of ASF outbreak herds was significantly lower compared to uninfected herds. This may reflect general improvement in the application of biosecurity measures over time in Estonian pig farms as the data on uninfected herds were collected later, at a time when intensified official controls may have had their effect. Larger herds were more at risk of being 'outbreak herds' compared to smaller herds. The biosecurity parameters significantly associated with 'outbreak herd' status in statistical analysis were mostly related to indirect contacts with the outside farm environment. The biosecurity barriers applied in Estonian pig farms have not been sufficient to avoid the introduction of ASF and need critical evaluation and improvement. Reduction of all contacts between the farm and the external environment should be emphasized in a situation where ASF is circulating in wild boar populations close to pig farms. Risk factors related to external biosecurity have been considered to play a major role in the introduction and spread of African swine fever (ASF) in domestic pig populations. The aim of the study was to describe the biosecurity levels and management practices of ASF outbreak and uninfected herds and to identify potential risk factors for ASF introduction. Data collected from the outbreak herds during outbreak investigations and from the randomly selected uninfected herds were analyzed. The biosecurity score in ASF outbreak herds was significantly lower compared to uninfected herds. However, this may reflect general improvement in the application of biosecurity measures in pig farms over time as the data on uninfected herds were collected later, at a time when intensified official controls may have had their effect. Larger herds were more at risk of being outbreak herds compared to smaller herds. The biosecurity parameters significantly associated with the outbreak herd status in multiple correspondence analysis were mostly related to indirect contacts with the outside farm environment. The biosecurity barriers applied in Estonian pig farms have not been sufficient to avoid ASF introduction and need critical evaluation and improvement. Reduction of all contacts between the farm and the external environment should be emphasized in a situation where ASF is circulating in wild boar populations close to pig farms.

AB  - Understanding the influence of population attributes on genetic diversity is important to advancement of biological conservation. Because bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) populations vary in size and management history, the species provides a unique opportunity to observe the response of average pairwise kinship, inversely related to genetic diversity, to a spectrum of natural and management influences. We estimated average pairwise kinship of bighorn sheep herds and compared estimates with population origin (native/indigenous/extant or reintroduced), historical minimum count, connectivity, and augmentation history, to determine which predictors were the most important. We evaluated 488 bighorn sheep from 19 wild populations with past minimum counts of 16-562 animals, including native and reintroduced populations that received 0-165 animals in augmentations. Using the Illumina High Density Ovine array, we generated a dataset of 7728 single nucleotide polymorphisms and calculated average pairwise kinship for each population. Multiple linear regression analysis determined that connectivity between populations via dispersal, greater number of animals received in augmentations, and greater minimum count were correlated with lower average pairwise kinship at the population level, and whether the population was extant or reintroduced was less important. Thus, our results indicated that genetic isolation of populations can result in increased levels of inbreeding. By determining that natural and human-assisted gene flow were likely the most important influences of average pairwise kinship at the population level, this study can serve as a benchmark for future management of bighorn sheep populations and aid in identifying populations of genetic concern to define priorities for conservation of wild populations.

AB  - Plastic marine debris is a common source of pollution. Recent research has shown that plastic debris has a negative impact on marine organisms and the environment. For the first time, we investigated the presence of microplastics (MPs) in the Nigerian Lagos Lagoon ecosystem water, sediment, and the most important fish species (Hepsetus odoe, Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus, Oreochromis niloticus, and Lachnolaimus maximus). MPs were found in water, sediment, and three carnivorous fish species (H. odoe, C. nigrodigitatus, and L. maximus), except for herbivorous O. niloticus, raising concerns about the health of the Nigerian Lagos Lagoon ecosystem and the human food chain. Across the lagoon, fibres were more concentrated in the water, while fragments predominated in the sediment. Plastic debris from recreational, industrial, and domestic wastes contributed significantly to this contamination. Given the potential dangers of MPs to human health, it is critical to protect the ecosystem and its inhabitants in the Lagoon from plastic pollution. Our findings highlight the need for urgent measures to protect Nigeria's fragile coastal and marine ecosystems.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an infectious prion disease that infects members of the Cervidae family (i.e., deer) resulting in widespread ecological, economic, and recreational ramifications. We introduce a spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM) that integrates individual deer movement and behavior with population and disease dynamics to forecast CWD in populations of free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We use a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Dead (S-E-I-D) epidemiological framework to explore spatiotemporal dynamics of CWD within an agriculturally dominated area in Michigan, USA. The IBM results closely mimicked documented short- and long-term dynamics of white-tailed deer populations and CWD in the Midwestern, USA. We applied pattern-oriented modeling using annual apparent CWD prevalence rates reported by Midwestern state wildlife agencies to validate the disease model. The introduction of a single infected deer to the modeled landscape (93 km2) led to an outbreak of CWD in 100 out of 350 model simulations (29 %); prevalence never exceeded 1.47 % for repetitions where the outbreak ended. For the 100 simulations where disease persisted, the deer population declined by 87 % by year 50 following initial introduction of CWD. Mean (+/- SD) prevalence after 5, 10, 25, and 50 years was 1.1 % (+/- 1.0 %), 3.4 % (+/- 3.3 %), 46.5 % (+/- 18.8 %), and 51.8 % (+/- 18.1 %), respectively, which highly correlated (r = 0.99) with annual CWD prevalence reported in Wisconsin white-tailed deer populations for years 1-21 post initial detection. Combined with a global sensitivity analysis, the IBM indicated that prevalence of CWD at year 20 was most sensitive to harvest rate of yearling and adult female deer and least sensitive to prion shedding rate, prion half-life, and deer group numbers, indicating that deer population parameters were more influential than disease parameters on CWD dynamics. Our IBM serves as a tool to explore and better understand indirect and direct transmission of CWD within free-ranging cervid populations. Users of this model can adjust parameter values to explore how interactions among individual deer and between deer and their environment affect CWD dynamics. This IBM also serves as a framework for applying and assessing spatially and temporally explicit management scenarios.

AB  - In recent years, the interest in increasingly sustainable agriculture has also turned attention towards new cover crops suitable for use in marginal areas that could enter the food chain as new protein and oil sources or for biodiesel production. In this scenario, Camelina sativa is a perfect crop to study. Camelina is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae which is interesting in terms of its oil content, since the seeds contain about 40% oils, with a high level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (30-40% alpha linolenic acid, 15-25% linoleic acid, 15% oleic acid and about 15% eicosenoic acid). It is a hexaploid species (2n = 40, genome size similar to 782 Mb) characterized by rapid growth, a short life cycle (85-100 days for spring varieties, 190-210 for autumn varieties) and low input cultivation needs. However, its use in feed and food is limited by the presence of glucosinolates (GLS). GLS are sulfur molecules involved in plant defense. In recent years, they have been studied not only as antinutritionals but also for their anti-carcinogenic effects against chronic inflammatory and heart diseases and for their use as natural pesticides. Given the recent interest in camelina and its highly nutritious oil, eight pure lines and a synthetic population were compared in two different growing periods, spring and winter. In this work, the genetic materials were characterized for different phenotypic traits, yields and yield components, and bromatological and glucosinolate content. The results confirmed that in North Italy, camelina has higher yields if cultivated in the autumn-winter period (about 2 t/ha vs. 0.6 t/ha); furthermore, a negative correlation was found between spring and winter yields, indicating that varieties that produce more in winter cultivation produce less in spring cultivation. Moreover, to our knowledge, it is the first work in which a synthetic population of Camelina sativa has been tested and proved to be a valid solution for use in various environments both for its adaptability and for the low content of glucosinolates (about 17 mmol/kg).

AB  - Simple Summary The PRRS eradication program in Hungary, carried out from 2014 to 2022, focused on replacing entire herds and using high-performance breeds to improve pig farming. This approach reduced the sow population by over 26% while keeping nearly the same number of pigs for slaughter. As a result, there were significant reductions in harmful emissions, such as ammonia and greenhouse gases, and a decrease in feed and water usage. The results show that tailored strategies and advanced breeding can make pig farming more efficient and environmentally friendly. This highlights the importance of collaboration between scientists, policymakers, and industry to create sustainable livestock practices.Abstract The Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) eradication program in Hungary, implemented between 2014 and 2022, utilized complete herd replacement and the introduction of high-performance breeds to enhance production efficiency and environmental sustainability in the swine sector. As a result, the sow population was reduced by 26.2% while maintaining nearly the same number of slaughter pigs. This led to significant reductions in ammonia emissions (-145,857 kg), slurry production (-153,879 m3), nitrogen emissions (-1,409,951 kg), and overall greenhouse gas emissions (91,768,362 kg CO2eq). Additionally, the feed and water consumption were substantially decreased by 53,237,805 kg and 292,978,094 L, respectively, further lowering the sector's environmental footprint. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of customized eradication strategies and advanced breeding practices in reducing the environmental impact of animal husbandry. These findings underscore the necessity for ongoing collaboration among scientists, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to develop and implement sustainable livestock production methods. The Hungarian experience provides valuable insights into how targeted interventions can simultaneously improve production outcomes and reduce the environmental burden in the swine industry.

AB  - Numerous studies have assessed the efficacy of environmentally based control methods to suppress populations of the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis Say), but few of these estimated the cost of control. We estimated costs for a range of tick control methods (including habitat management, deer exclusion or population reduction, broadcast of acaricides, and use of host-targeted acaricides) implemented singly or in combination and applied to a model community comprising 320 residential properties and parklands. Using the high end for cost ranges, tick control based on a single method was estimated to have mean annual costs per household in the model community ranging from $132 for treating only forest ecotone with a broadcast synthetic acaricide to kill host-seeking ticks (or $404 for treating all residential forested habitat) to >$2,000 for deployment of bait boxes (SELECT TCS) across all residential tick habitat to treat rodents topically with acaricide to kill infesting ticks. Combining different sets of multiple methods in an integrated tick management program placed the annual cost between $508 and 3,192 annually per household in the model community, underscoring the disconnect between what people in Lyme disease endemic areas say they are willing to pay for tick control (not more than $100-150 annually) and the actual costs for tick control. Additional barriers to implementing community-based tick management programs within residential communities are discussed.

AB  - Determining the factors that drive the distributions of threatened species is often critical for informing effective conservation management actions. Species distribution models can be used to distinguish common habitat features shared by limited historical records and identify other areas where a species might persist. In this study, we built a species distribution model for the Endangered and cryptic Kangaroo Island dunnart (Sminthopsis fuliginosus aitkeni). We fitted generalised linear models using incidental records and presence-absence data from surveys between 1969 and 2018. In the models we included the variables rainfall, percentage native vegetation in the surrounding 2 km(2), and post-fire vegetation age. The modelling suggested that rainfall and to a lesser extent post-fire vegetation age are good predictors of dunnart occurrence, with dunnart occurrence greatest in areas of high rainfall (>600 mm) and vegetation age classes <30 years post fire. Potentially suitable habitat for the KI dunnart was predicted to be on the central-western side of Kangaroo Island. These results suggest that careful fire management could benefit the dunnart, and that decreased rainfall (as projected by Australian climate models), will be a threat in the long term. Extensive recent fires on western Kangaroo Island suggest that climate-related threats are already being realised.

AB  - The Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) faces population declines in the western part of its range, and its ecological requirements are poorly understood in the eastern part of its range. The Romanian Carpathians harbor an intact large carnivore community, in which lynx co-occur with bears (Ursus arctos), wolves (Canis lupus), and humans (Homo sapiens), with which they potentially compete for ungulate prey. We provide a science-based estimate of lynx density and habitat use, combining non-invasive monitoring techniques (camera trapping) with spatially explicit capture-recapture models (SECR) in the Southern Carpathians of Romania. We sampled 59 and 76 trap stations during two monitoring sessions (winter and autumn), identified at least 30 individuals, from which we reconstructed encounter histories for 23 individuals. SECR modeling resulted in similar density estimates between winter and autumn (1.6 +/- 0.39 SE and 1.7 +/- 0.38 SE lynx/100 km(2), respectively), but the cumulative number of lynx detected reached the asymptote faster during autumn, suggesting that monitoring prior to the mating season is preferable. Density varied within and across sessions with topography (slope), percent forest cover, and landscape heterogeneity (i.e., agricultural mosaic). Density hotspots shifted between low-altitude agricultural mosaic during winter and more rugged, mid-altitude forest stands during autumn. Estimated densities of lynx in the Romanian Carpathians are higher than those reported in the Alps or Slovak Carpathians, highlighting the importance of this population as a source both for natural recolonization and recent reintroduction programs. When used in an SECR framework, camera trapping is an efficient method for assessing spatial and temporal variation in lynx population density in the remote Romanian Carpathians. We recommend this methodology for improving lynx population estimates and to monitor lynx population trends nationwide.

AB  - Simple Summary Game meat popularity is connected with the fact that harvesting game is part of the sustainable management of game species. As hunted animals grow in their natural environments-with access to natural forage, exercise, and unlimited possibilities to perform natural behaviors-consumers are enabled to think about game meat as a healthy product, obtained from animals that grew in welfare-friendly conditions. On the other hand, the popularity of using offal (including those from game species) in dishes or processed products is lower compared to muscle tissue and differs among cultures and regions. Nevertheless, we should remember that offal is a nutritional and valuable animal product, and its use allows us to limit the amounts of utilized by-products, and therefore should also be considered from the perspective of sustainability in the meat production chain and its environmental effects. The goal of this study was to examine the seasonal variation in the body composition, carcass composition, and quality of edible internal organs from the fallow deer hunt-harvested in the summer (n = 9) and the winter (n = 10) seasons. The weight and proportion of the mesenteric and omental fat were greater for the animals harvested in the winter (1.12 kg and 2.75%) compared to those from the summer season (0.43 kg and 1.02%). The winter-harvested animals had more perinephric fat (0.75 kg and 1.84%) than those hunted in summer (0.26 kg and 1.84%). The gastrointestinal tract of the fallow deer hunted in summer was more filled with feed and therefore heavier (7.92 kg) compared to those from the winter season (5.16 kg). The proportion of fat was significantly greater in the carcasses obtained in winter compared to the summer season (6.55% vs. 3.79%). No seasonal variety was found in the physicochemical characteristics of the edible offal, but the content of extractable fat was significantly affected by the season. In conclusion, the effect of the season on the slaughter value of the hunt-harvested fallow deer was limited to a variation in the proportion of some of the internal organs and affected the fat deposition in the body of the examined animals. The season significantly affected the fat content in the carcass and the extractable fat content in the examined offal.

AB  - Individual specialization in the foraging behaviour of marine predators can affect the ecology, evolution, and ability of a population to respond to environmental variability and human impacts.
   Here, blood serum and whisker stable isotope values from New Zealand (NZ) sea lion pups (Phocarctos hookeri) are compared with their mother's values to identify whether they can be used as proxies to identify their mother's isotopic niche and foraging strategy.
   Female NZ sea lions have been identified, both through telemetry and stable isotope research of blood serum and whiskers, to have two distinct foraging ecotypes (mesopelagic or benthic), consistent across their adult life. Females who are mesopelagic foragers have higher overlap and a greater risk of harmful interactions with fisheries.
   Stable isotope analysis of adult females can be used to determine the proportion of the female population exposed to these detrimental interactions. However, the capture, restraint, and removal of a whisker or blood from an adult female NZ sea lion is an expensive, time-consuming, and invasive undertaking. Instead, by comparing the blood serum and whisker delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of 12 NZ sea lion mother-and-pup pairs, for whom the foraging behaviour of the female is known, the question as to whether a pup's blood serum or whisker isotope value can be used as a proxy to identify female foraging ecotype was investigated.
   The delta C-13 and delta N-15 values for the blood serum and whiskers of pups and their mothers were correlated and differed significantly between foraging ecotypes. This research validates that pup blood serum and whisker stable isotope values from 1-month-old pups can be used as indicators of female isotopic niche and therefore foraging ecotype.
   This tool can be used across all NZ sea lion colonies to indicate female NZ sea lion foraging ecotypes. For the Auckland Islands, it could determine the proportion of breeding females exposed to negative interactions with fisheries, leading to a better understanding of the level of these effects and helping to implement appropriate management to mitigate impacts.

AB  - Humans have altered marine ecosystems over very long-time scales and historical data is often needed to understand the true magnitude of human impacts. The Southwest Atlantic Ocean has a long history of large-scale removal of marine vertebrates due to whaling, sealing, and fishing in the past three centuries. Historical catch records are crucial in assessing the conservation status of these historically over-exploited populations and setting suitable recovery goals. However, several gaps in the history of exploitation of many populations limit our ability to judge recoveries success. This study examines the history of the Spanish fishing company, the Real Compania Maritima (Royal Maritime Company), and reconstructs its catches of marine mammals in Patagonia and on the north coast of the Rio de la Plata. The analysis of a wide range of historical sources reveals that, between the years 1790 and 1804, the Company extracted less than 100 southern right whales Eubalaena australis, some 200,000 South American fur seals Arctocephalus australis and South American sea lions Otaria flavescens, and a few southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina. Although the Company's whale catch is negligible compared to that of other nations in the same whaling grounds, the amount of fur seals and sea lions removed from the ecosystem deserves attention. This historical survey provides us with the first estimate of the catches made by the Real Compania Maritima. However, these figures only represent a small part of the extractive activities that took place in the region and further research is encouraged to assess the true dimension of human impacts on Southwest Atlantic ecosystems. The incorporation of retrospective data into ecological studies can be laborious and may have inherent biases, but it also provides valuable information for comprehending modern ecosystems and formulating appropriate conservation plans.

AB  - In this paper, we apply standard zooarchaeological methods and novel osteological approaches to analyse faunal remains from five Middle-Late Holocene sites in the southern Tibetan Plateau (STP). Framed by direct radiocarbon dates on taxonomically classified bioarchaeological remains and compared with published palaeoclimate data, our findings revealed a three-stage process of agro-pastoral development in the STP ca. 5.5 to 1.0 ka. In the first phase, habitation was restricted to the lower southeastern part of the plateau and human subsistence essentially based on foraging and low-level pig-millet farming. With the onset of colder and drier climatic conditions ca. 3.8 ka, the study area witnessed a growing human presence at higher elevations in its central and western parts, together with a shift towards bovid husbandry and barley cultivation, that is, agricultural practices that originated in west Asia; these were likely introduced to the STP following the eastern margin of the TP and/or arrived by sub-Himalayan transfer. Climate and ecological degradation might have contributed to the decline of local game in favour of cold-and-dry-tolerant pastoral livestock and crops. Our work shows that Middle-Late Holocene climate change, ecological change, human subsistence shifts, and prehistoric cultural transmissions are intimately connected.

AB  - Conservation management of natural populations is ideally based on the most accurate data of critical variables including demography, natural history and population size. Although Caribbean iguanids are highly threatened by a range of anthropogenic threats, the native melanistic Iguana iguana populations in the Lesser Antilles have received surprisingly little research attention. Here we assessed population size, distribution and degree of melanism for the melanistic iguanas of Saba, Caribbean Netherlands based on one month of fieldwork. Distance sampling (based on 117 separate surveys along 38 unique transects, totalling 48 survey hrs) estimated the island population size at 8233 +/- 2205 (SD) iguanas. Female maximum snout-vent length (39.0 cm) of 56 captured iguanas was less than that of males (43.9 cm). Iguanas mainly occurred on the southern and eastern sides of the island, at mid-altitudes between 180 and 390 m (max 530 m), with highest densities being in residential and certain natural areas. Historically, iguanas have been reported from higher altitudes, where their presence was likely facilitated by former extensive forest clearing for agricultural reasons. Contrary to earlier statements claiming that 20% of adult males were fully melanistic, we found that only 1% of adult iguanas exhibited > 90% melanism, whereas 81% of males were less than 50% melanistic on the body. No relationship was found between the degree of melanism and elevation, which has been suggested by others. Probably, one main threat to the Saba green iguana population is the documented crossbreeding with non-native green iguanas. Beyond non-native iguanas, the long-term stability of the native population appears under pressure given the limited nesting sites and extremely low presence of juvenile and hatchling iguanas (2.4%). In particular, the island's feral cat and large goat population likely impact nest-site quality, nest success and hatchling survival.

AB  - Alien plants are often introduced to new areas for their ornamental value, making gardens and cities a major source of invasive alien species. The aim of the study was to determine how anthropogenic factors affect the interactions between invasive plants and pathogenic fungi in urban environments. Three different species of invasive plants were studied: Padus serotina, Spiraea tomentosa and Acer negundo in different habitats in Poland. Between 2017 and 2019, data on disease severity (DSI) and fungal abundance on leaves and seeds were collected and analysed using two generalised linear models (GLMs) to compare DSI and fungal diversity. Additionally, a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) was used to compare fungal abundance on seeds. The results showed that plants in urban areas had an increased DSI compared to plants in more natural habitats. In addition, air pollution, particularly SO2 and PM10 and PM2.5 particulate matter, had a negative effect on DSI, suggesting that air pollution may reduce fungal disease. In contrast, increased sunlight, higher temperatures and greater distance from water negatively impacted plant health. Moreover, seeds from urban plants showed higher fungal diversity and greater abundance of primary pathogens, including Fusarium spp., suggesting that urban areas may serve as favourable habitats for pathogen development. The study highlights the complex interaction between anthropogenic factors, invasive plants and fungal pathogens, suggesting that urban areas may facilitate the development and spread of plant pathogens. It may also shed light on the conditions that influence the domestication process of invasive alien plants.

AB  - Simple Summary The ladybird beetle fauna of the Canary Islands is quite specific due to the presence of a number of species that do not occur anywhere else (the so-called endemic species). However, many ladybirds recorded in the archipelago are relatively recent arrivals from various parts of the world, as shown by our previous surveys carried out in several of the Canary Islands, including Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, Gran Canaria, and El Hierro. In this paper, we analyze the ladybird fauna of La Palma, one of the western islands of the archipelago, based on our field survey and already published data. The survey resulted in the recording of 26 species, seven of which had not previously been recorded on La Palma, and two of these seven had not been recorded on any of the Canary Islands. Combining our data and literature reports gives a figure of at least 35 ladybird species recorded to date on La Palma. This is fewer than on the central islands of the Canary archipelago (Gran Canaria and Tenerife), but more than on the other four islands (Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, La Gomera, and El Hierro). This study confirms previous observations that the Canary Islands are often colonized by exotic ladybird species. This paper provides new data on the ladybird beetles (Coccinellidae) of La Palma, one of the western islands of the Canarian archipelago. The field survey of 54 study sites resulted in recording 2494 ladybird individuals belonging to 26 species. Seven of the species recorded were new to La Palma, including two, Harmonia quadripunctata (Pontoppidan) and Nephus reunioni (Fursch), which were not registered so far on any of the Canary Islands. Novius conicollis (Korschefsky) is synonymized with N. cruentatus (Mulsant). Taking our survey and literature reports into account, a total of at least 35 species of Coccinellidae have so far been recorded on La Palma. This richness in species is lower compared to that of the central islands of the Canarian archipelago, Gran Canaria (42 species) and Tenerife (41 species), but higher than that of the remaining four islands (between 22 and 27 species). The detection of two alien species new to La Palma, Nephaspis bicolor Gordon and Nephus reunioni (Fursch), confirms earlier observations that colonization of the Canary Islands by ladybird species of exotic origins seems to be a frequent phenomenon.

AB  - An understanding of public preference for species is critical for conservation efforts because successful conservation action often requires human intervention. In this study, we introduce a novel research approach using toy models to assess wildlife preference and perceived masculinity/femininity among children and adults in multi-generation households across a spectrum of socio-demographic and household-level characteristics. The golden retriever, gray wolf, monarch butterfly, and lion were the most preferred species for both children and adults. The lion, bull shark, wild boar, gray wolf, and black bear were ranked by parents as the most masculine and the monarch butterfly and flamingo most feminine. We observed differences in preference based on gender, race, ownership of pets, and household participation in hunting or bird watching. These findings suggest significant preference overlap between children and adults and the possibility of intergenerational transfer of gendered preferences for wildlife species.

AB  - Novel crop rotation is an important factor influencing the composition of soil microorganisms. However, the effect of introducing oilseed and cover crops (CCs) into monoculture durum rotations on soil microbial communities is not clear in the Northern Great Plains. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of 2-year durum (Triticum durum D.) rotations with Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata A.) or camelina (Camelina sativa L.) or a 10-species forage/CC mix planted to replace fallow rotations with wheat on soil microorganisms. This study was designed as a randomized complete block with three replications in a no-tillage system. The results showed that total bacterial proportion was significantly higher in durum following fallow and camelina compared to durum following CC and carinata. Total fungal proportion was significantly higher in durum following CC compared to durum following oilseed crops and fallow. The fungal-to-bacterial ratio was significantly higher in durum following CC compared to durum following camelina and fallow. The crop species, soil pH and highly variable rainfall influenced the microbial community dynamics. The abundance of specific microbial groups due to crop-related changes might play a key role in the yield of subsequent crops and soil biological health. This study provides valuable insights into the use of CC mix and oilseeds as an alternative crop for fallow in a wheat-fallow system under dryland farming conditions. Future work is required to elucidate the biological mechanisms and functions of the soil microbial communities in the preceding and subsequent crop relative to soil health and crop productivity.

AB  - Co-composting is the controlled aerobic degradation of organics, using more than one feedstock. By combining the spent mushroom substrate of Pholiota nameko (SMS) and pig manure (PM), the benefits of each could be used to optimize the composting process and the final product. This study introduced a comprehensive evaluation strategy aimed at identifying the optimal co-composting ratio for these two substrates. A 120-day composting trial was conducted, blending SMS and PM in various ratios to evaluate the benefits of co-composting SMS-PM. The results indicated that dissolved organic matter (DOM) in SMS-derived compost primarily originated from plants, whereas PM-derived compost predominantly consisted of microbial metabolic products, and cocomposting combined both sources. An increase in aromaticity and humification degree of DOM occurred during the composting process itself rather than being derived from autochthonous origin. Carbohydrates like phenols and alcohols broke down during composting, and microbes utilized polysaccharides as an energy source for humus formation. As co-composting progressed, the treatments with varying mass ratios of SMS to PM, including 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, 5:5, 4:6, and 3:7 were observed to result in a decline in aliphatic hydroxylated chains alongside an enhancement in aromaticity within the compost. Additionally, there was a conversion from organic carbon (C) to carboxyl C within humic acid (HA) due to oxidation and dehydrogenation processes that facilitated the formation of stable nitrogen-containing compounds characterized by condensed aromatic structures. Following thorough evaluation, it was determined that optimal composting efficacy occurred at a mass ratio of SMS to PM equal to 6:4. Post-compost analysis revealed increases in nutrient content; specifically, germination index (GI) value reached 132.7%, while organic matter content attained 45.3%. Conversely, electrical conductivity (EC), C contents of water-soluble substances and humin (Cwss and CHu) decreased by approximately 11.8%, 73.4%, and 29.8% respectively; meanwhile, C contents of humic-extracted acid and HA (CHE and CHA), along with degree of polymerization (DP), increased by 17.3%, 20.3% and 9.9% respectively. The proposed cocompost formula not only facilitated simultaneous recycling of both SMS and PM waste but also transformed them into high-quality organic fertilizers suitable for soil enrichment-effectively addressing challenges faced by both edible fungi cultivation and livestock industries while augmenting organic fertilizer sources for Black land protection.

AB  - Plants associate with both aboveground and belowground mutualists, two prominent examples being ants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), respectively. While both of these mutualisms have been extensively studied, joint manipulations testing their independent and interactive (non-additive) effects on plants are rare. To address this gap, we conducted a joint test of ant and AMF effects on herbivory by leaf-chewing insects attacking potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants, and further measured plant traits likely mediating mutualist effects on herbivory. In a field experiment, we factorially manipulated the presence of AMF (two levels: control and mycorrhization) and ants (two levels: exclusion and presence) and quantified the concentration of leaf phenolic compounds acting as direct defenses, as well as plant volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions potentially mediating direct (e.g., herbivore repellents) or indirect (e.g., ant attractants) defense. Moreover, we measured ant abundance and performed a dual-choice greenhouse experiment testing for effects of VOC blends (mimicking those emitted by control vs. AMF-inoculated plants) on ant attraction as a mechanism for indirect defense. Ant presence significantly reduced herbivory whereas mycorrhization had no detectable influence on herbivory and mutualist effects operated independently. Plant trait measurements indicated that mycorrhization had no effect on leaf phenolics but significantly increased VOC emissions. However, mycorrhization did not affect ant abundance and there was no evidence of AMF effects on herbivory operating via ant-mediated defense. Consistently, the dual-choice assay showed no effect of AMF-induced volatile blends on ant attraction. Together, these results suggest that herbivory on potato plants responds mainly to top-down (ant-mediated) rather than bottom-up (AMF-mediated) control, an asymmetry in effects which could have precluded mutualist non-additive effects on herbivory. Further research on this, as well as other plant systems, is needed to examine the ecological contexts under which mutualist interactive effects are more or less likely to emerge and their impacts on plant fitness and associated communities.

AB  - The Common Fallow Deer (Dama dama; hereafter "fallow deer") has been widely translocated from its native Mediterranean range and is now present on all continents except Antarctica. In some countries-such as Australia-introduced populations of fallow deer have increased in range and abundance, negatively affecting agricultural production. However, little is known about how this species uses these agricultural landscapes annually, seasonally, or daily. We used GPS collars to track the hourly movements of 68 adult fallow deer (25 males, 43 females) at 3 sites in mixed pastoral farmland (a mosaic of open eucalypt woodland and pasture) in eastern Australia between 2020 and 2024. We estimated annual and monthly home ranges, daily distance moved, and diel movement cycles. As expected, annual home ranges (using the biased random bridge method) were larger for males (median = 1,848.1 ha, 95% CrI: 929.2 to 3,584.0 ha) than females (median = 646.3 ha, 95% CrI: 368.1 to 1,068.5 ha), and home ranges and core areas were similar across the 3 sites. Both sexes had a strong crepuscular movement pattern that was consistent across sites. Male fallow deer increased their movement rates in April-May (i.e., during the mating season), and their movement patterns were most restricted during summer. Female fallow deer movements were more consistent across the year than those of males, but movement patterns were also most restricted during summer. There was substantial individual variation in daily movement patterns between and within sites, especially during the mating season. Most individuals exhibited strong site fidelity, but some males and females made short excursions (up to a week and 10 km) from their home range. The strong site fidelity of fallow deer suggests that management strategies utilizing repeated culling will be most effective at reducing overabundant fallow deer populations in Australian agricultural landscapes.
   Common Fallow Deer (Dama dama) in mixed pastoral and woodland habitat in Australia occupied large home ranges. Movement behavior varied seasonally, between sexes, and among individuals, but was consistent across 3 sites. Strong site fidelity suggests that repeated culling will be most effective at reducing overabundant deer populations.

AB  - Rhinogobius candidianus is a freshwater goby distributed in north, northwest, west, and south Taiwan, but this species has been introduced to east Taiwan and became dominant. To investigate its native population genetic diversity and structure and evaluate the sources and diversity of translocated populations, the mitochondrial DNA control region and cytochrome b gene (1981 bp) from 220 specimens were analyzed. These results indicated that (1) the east populations originated from two sources in west Taiwan; (2) translocated populations exist in east Taiwan and south Taiwan; (3) many populations have likely been moved secondarily by human intervention; (4) the effective size of the populations had declined greatly; (5) within the native populations, the ancestral populations colonized Taiwan during the land bridge phase in the Pleistocene through north Taiwan; (6) the landform changes in Taiwan shaped the population structure; and (7) the landforms of the coastline during glaciation also shaped the native range. The low-level genetic diversity, high population differentiation, and population decline greatly suggest the need for resource management and conservation interventions. Four clades (alpha-delta) should be managed as four distinct evolutionarily significant units, while the translocated populations should be managed as separate management units. Moreover, the translocated populations in east Taiwan should be evaluated and monitored carefully.

AB  - Insect-plant interactions are less well studied than other types of herbivory on islands, precluding a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary ecology of these interactions. Declines in native island plants and insects call for urgent attention to characterize these species' interactions for their conservation and to better understand evolution in these unique, insular ecosystems. In Hawai'i, the Kamehameha butterfly (Vanessa tameamea) is one of only two native butterflies, and larvae are specialists on native urticaceous plants. Using a no-choice bioassay, we investigated performance of V. tameamea reared from egg hatching through eclosion on four native urticaceous host plants, Boehmeria grandis, Pipturus albidus, Touchardia latifolia, and Touchardia oahuensis, and one exotic urticaceous species, Cecropia obtusifolia. Performance varied significantly among the plant diets, with V. tameamea performing best on P. albidus and T. oahuensis among the performance metrics of survival, pupal and adult body mass, and development time. Larval responses to the exotic host plant C. obtusifolia varied among populations, with O'ahu caterpillars successfully completing development on it, but Hawai'i Island caterpillars rejecting it completely, suggesting a geographic mosaic for this novel species interaction. Characterization of a suite of nutritive and defensive plant traits revealed significant variability among plant species, but patterns did not align well with V. tameamea performance rankings, making it difficult to identify key drivers of host plant quality. Future work examining additional plant traits under natural conditions would provide new insights, contributing critical ecological information to conserve this charismatic island species.
   The endemic Hawaiian Kamehameha butterfly is a specialist on Urticaceous host plants. Yet, caterpillar performance varies significantly among 4 native and 1 non-native host plant. Potential defense and nutritive traits also vary among host plant species, but are not consistent with performance rankings, highlighting this as future research need.image

AB  - Transport infrastructures, such as highways, disrupt animal migrations and cause roadkill. To mitigate the latter problem, fences have been built but their effectiveness has rarely been tested under controlled conditions. Here, we tested the effectiveness of the most commonly used fence in France and probably in Europe (wire netting fence) to block animals. We tested the wire netting fence, with and without a structural modification (i.e. an overhang), with three small mammalian species (the European hamster: Cricetus cricetus Linnaeus, 1758; the common vole: Microtus arvalis Pallas, 1778 & the wood mouse: Apodemus sylvaticus Linnaeus, 1758) and two amphibian species (the marsh frog: Pelophylax ridibundus Pallas, 1771 & the European green toad: Bufotes viridis Laurenti, 1768). During testing, all small vertebrate species tested were placed into an arena, from which they could only escape by crossing the wire netting fence. Without an overhang, almost all adult individuals of all tested species were able to climb over a 30 to 40 cm high wire netting fence. Furthermore, the addition of an 8 cm long overhang at the top of the fence stopped the amphibian species tested but not the most agile mammalian species, such as the hamster and the wood mouse. Based on these results, we do not support the construction of wire netting fences along roads as a measure to stop small animals from crossing. We recommend the use of more effective and durable fences, which, in addition, can be associated with wildlife passages to reconnect isolated populations.

AB  - Simple Summary In the Galapagos Islands, food animal agriculture is an important source of local meat and eggs and is driven by smallholder farms. With anticipated future increases in production animal populations in the Galapagos-one of the most biodiverse and protected ecosystems on the planet-the health of humans, animals, and the environment must be considered. An integral component of sustainable agriculture is animal welfare, which considers the health, nutrition, housing, and behavior of animals. To our knowledge, no formal assessments of production animal welfare have been conducted in the Galapagos Islands. We evaluated animal welfare conditions on farms located on Floreana Island, Galapagos utilizing five basic measures of animal care. We identified opportunities for enhanced activities in two of these measures, animal health management and timely euthanasia. Future work should promote knowledge transfer and in-country capacity building in these areas. Efforts to positively impact smallholder farm livelihoods in the Galapagos Islands will sustainably support the interconnected realms of animal health and welfare, wildlife and environmental health, and food safety and security in this unique ecosystem. Globally to date, established international standards for animal welfare, a priority of sustainable agriculture, have primarily focused on large-scale producers. However, across Latin America, including in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands, smallholder farms play a critical role in food safety and security. We assessed five basic animal welfare measures (feed and water access, shelter availability and housing systems, animal health management, animal behavior, and timely euthanasia) for poultry, pigs, and cattle on Floreana Island, Galapagos. Utilizing assessment standards from multiple US sources and international standards, we developed a questionnaire and used it to conduct in-depth interviews during 4-5 July 2022 with eight participating producers, representing 75% of animal agriculture on Floreana. While we identified opportunities to enhance competencies in animal health management and timely euthanasia, farms performed well in the other assessed measures. Future work should promote knowledge transfer and in-country capacity building in farm biosecurity, access to veterinary care, antimicrobial resistance surveillance, and euthanasia methods. Efforts to positively impact smallholder farm livelihoods in Galapagos-one of the most biodiverse and protected ecosystems on the planet-will sustainably support human health through the interconnected realms of animal health and welfare, wildlife and environmental health, and food safety and security.

AB  - When facing changes in the available forage fish composition and distribution, seabirds are expected to respond by switching their prey species and/or adjusting their key foraging areas. We studied chick-rearing Rhinoceros Auklets Cerorhincamonocerata at Teuri Island, Japan, across three successive years. We examined inter-annual and seasonal changes in their prey species by sampling bill-loads fed to chicks, and surveyed their foraging areas using GPS data-loggers. In 2020, auklets foraged on sand lance Ammodytes spp. in shallow coastal areas along the mainland, similar to 150 km from the colony. In 2021 however, they foraged on an alternative prey, age-0 Greenling Pleurogrammusazonus, in cool basin deep waters > 150 km away in the early season, and later switched to Herring Clupeapallasii caught in warm coastal waters. In 2022, they foraged on Anchovy Engraulisjaponicus in offshore and coastal waters < 150 km away. These changes in the auklets' foraging areas mirrored the respective habitat of the dominant prey species in each case. In turn, these changes determined their foraging trip duration: the birds made longer trips in 2021 (45.5 h) than in 2020 (30.9 h) or 2022 (22.8 h). Longer overnight trips undertaken when auklets foraged in areas more than 130-180 km away from the colony, likely decreased chick meal frequency in this day-foraging/night-provisioning species. Although they could make longer foraging trips than day-foraging/day-provisioning species, the inter-annual variability of forage fish community might result in more frequent reproductive failure under the unconventional climate regime currently in place around Japan.

AB  - Background The establishment of non-native populations of threatened and legally protected species can have many implications for the areas where these species have been introduced. Non-native populations of threatened species have the potential to be exploited and therefore the subject of legal protection, while conversely, if they have become invasive in their introduced range, there is the likelihood that population control will be carried out to reduce abundance and negative impacts associated with introduced species. From both a legal and invasive species monitoring standpoint, it is important to know how many individuals are present. Methods and results Short tandem repeats (STRs) were developed for the hog deer, an endangered species that was introduced following European settlement to Victoria, Australia using Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology. These markers were combined with previous STRs characterised for hog deer to create a 29-plex identification system. A total of 224 samples were genotyped across the population in Victoria, and further analyses of null allele frequencies, deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and the removal of monomorphic or low amplifying markers resulted in a final marker panel of 15 loci. Despite low values for number of alleles at each locus (2-4), probability of identity showed sufficient discrimination power, with an average probability of identity at 2.94 x 10(-6), and a probability of sibling identity of 8.9 x 10(-4) across all sites. Conclusions It is feasible to create an informative DNA profiling system that can distinguish between individuals for applications in both wildlife forensic and population control research.

AB  - Each dietary analysis method has its own strengths and limitations and provides different perspectives for understanding the trophic biology of aquatic organisms. In this study, we used an integrative, multi-tool approach to comprehensively investigate the dietary differences of eight nominally herbivorous fishes from five feeding guilds in the Nansha Islands (N: 8 & DEG;51 & PRIME;10 & DEG;57', E: 112 & DEG;50 & PRIME;115 & DEG;35') of the South China Sea. The methods used in this study included 18S rDNA metabarcoding, standard gut content analysis, and stable isotope analysis. DNA metabarcoding revealed diverse algae categories (Ochrophyta, Rhodophyta, and Chlorophyta) in the gut contents of sampled fishes with high taxonomic resolution, and some microscopic and cryptic taxa, such as dinoflagellates and microinvertebrates, were precisely identified. The overlap of 95% prediction isotopic niche remained below 30% between different feeding guilds, and nearly 70% of the 107 genera detected in the gut contents were not shared by two or more fish species or feeding guilds. By combining stable isotope analysis and morphological identification with gut content metabarcoding, we found that the dietary overlap detected by metabarcodng between Ctenochaetus striatus and other fishes may be due to interference from debris of algae or other organisms. While each method has its own limitations in dietary analysis, our study suggests that an integrative, multi-tool approach can remedy the limitations of one method by utilizing the strengths of another. Our results indicate that a wide spectrum of resources on coral reefs could be utilized by different fish species in a complementary manner.

AB  - Fecal pollution contributes to global degradation of water quality and requires identification of the source(s) for predicting human health risk, tracking disease, and developing management strategies. While fecal indicator bacteria are commonly used to detect fecal pollution, they cannot identify sources. Novel approaches, such as microbial source tracking (MST), can be applied to evaluate the origin of fecal pollution. This study examined fecal pollution in the coral reef lagoons of Norfolk Island, Australia where reef health decline has been related to nutrient input. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the host sensitivity and specificity of two human wastewater-associated marker genes (Bacteroides HF183 (HF183) and cross-assembly phage (crAssphage)) and four animal feces associated marker genes targeting avian, ruminant, dog, and pig (Helicobacter-associated GFD (GFD), Bacteroides BacR (BacR), Bacteroides DogBact (DogBact), and Bacteroides Pig-2-Bac (Pig-2-Bac)) in wastewater and animal fecal samples collected from Norfolk Island. The prevalence and concentrations of these marker genes along with enterococci genetic marker (ENT 23S rRNA) of general fecal pollution and human adenovirus (HAdV), which is considered predominantly a pathogen but also a human-wastewater associated marker gene, were determined in surface, ground, and marine water resources. A secondary objective of this study was to assess the sources and pathways of fecal pollution to a sensitive marine environment under rainfall events. HF183, crAssphage, HAdV, and BacR demonstrated absolute host sensitivity values of 1.00, while GFD and Pig-2-Bac had host sensitivity values of 0.60, and 0.20, respectively. Host specificity values were > 0.94 for all marker genes. Human and animal (avian, ruminant, dog) fecal sources were present in the coral reef lagoons and surface water whereas groundwater was polluted by human wastewater markers. This study provides understanding of fecal pollution in water resources on Norfolk Island, Australia after precipitation events. The results may aid in effective water quality management, mitigating potential adverse effects on both human and environmental health.

AB  - Knowledge about the diets of New Zealand's extinct moa (Aves: Dinornithiformes) is heavily biased towards just three species (Dinornis robustus, Megalapteryx didinus and Pachyornis elephantopus), which represent about 90% of all identified coprolites and gizzard content samples. By comparison, the diets of the other six moa species are poorly known. Here, we report the discovery of a new coprolite deposit attributed to little bush moa (Anomalopteryx didiformis) based on DNA barcoding and former moa species distributions. The deposit is the southernmost site from which moa coprolites have been recovered and just the second to contain mid-Holocene specimens. Moreover, the deposit provides the longest known temporal span (similar to 2200 years) of moa coprolites within a stratigraphic context. Pollen and plant DNA from the coprolites, as well as associated plant macrofossils, indicate that the deposit spans a period when the forest canopy was transitioning from Podocarpaceae to silver beech (Lophozonia menziesii) dominance about 6800-4600 years ago. Our analysis of coprolite content supports the current hypothesis that little bush moa browsed trees and shrubs within the forest understorey, but provides new evidence that ferns were also an important part of their diet. Based on this finding, we suggest that moa might once have played a previously unrecognised role in the dispersal of ground fern spores throughout New Zealand forests. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A new regulation has led to the prohibition of recreational hunting on estates located within Spanish National Parks (NPs). Before the ban, eleven NPs in Spain had already reported negative ecological consequences associated with high densities of wild ungulates. The new situation that has occurred after the ban signifies that policies with which to control populations of wild ungulates in NPs, most of which do not have a sufficient natural capacity to regulate populations, depend exclusively on the parks ' authorities. The banning of recreational hunting implies a series of social, ecological, economic and logistic challenges. The control of wild ungulate populations in NPs requires: i) the legal basis for culling; ii) social acceptance as regards removing animals and the extractive procedures employed in NPs; iii) the long-term monitoring of wild ungulates and the damages that they cause, and iv) sufficient financial and human resources. A more integrated management and policy plan is, therefore, required, which should be supported by two pillars: i) the sustainability of natural resources and the conservation of functional environments, and ii) providing society with explanations regarding the need to manage wild ungulates. In order to bridge the potential gap between these key pillars, it is important to involve stakeholders in the decision-making processes concerning wild ungulate management. The forthcoming changes in Spanish NPs provide a promising opportunity to make a substantial improvement to wild ungulate management in these protected areas. This management approach could, moreover, serve as an example and be transferred to other protected spaces.

AB  - This paper investigates whether carbon payments are sufficient to entice private landholders to invest in the rehabilitation and protection of coastal wetlands as a nature-based climate solution. Ecologically intact coastal wetlands, such as mangroves and saltmarshes, are capable of sequestering and storing large amounts of carbon. Reinstating ecological functionality of degraded coastal wetlands may be achieved by installing conservation fences that exclude hard-hoofed domestic and feral animals. This research integrates ecological, technical and economic data to ascertain whether conservation fencing could represent a financially viable investment for coastal landholders in the Australian context, if restored wetlands attracted carbon payments. Data gleaned through literature review and expert interviews about technical fencing requirements, contemporary costs and potential blue carbon income are consolidated into scenarios and tested using cost-benefit analysis. Payback periods are calculated using deterministic parameters. Risk-based cost-benefit analysis accounts for uncertainty of ecological and price parameters; it provides probability distributions of benefit-cost ratios assuming an expert-agreed economic lifespan of conservation fences. The results demonstrate that the payback period and benefit-cost ratio are highly sensitive to wetlands' carbon sequestration capacity, fencing costs and the carbon price going forward. In general, carbon payments on their own are likely insufficient to entice private landholders to protect coastal wetlands through conservation fencing, except in circumstances where restored wetlands achieve high additional carbon sequestration rates. Policy measures that reduce up-front costs and risk and remuneration of multiple ecosystem services provided by restored wetlands are required to upscale blue carbon solutions using conservation fencing. The research findings bear relevance for other conservation and land-use contexts that use fencing to achieve sustainability goals and generate payments for ecosystem services.

AB  - Natural Trap Cave (NTC) preserves abundant late Pleistocene herbivore remains including equids (Equus and Haringtonhippus) and the sheep Ovis. The NTC equid sample contains a minimum of two taxa, while other large herbivore genera are represented by single species. In modern communities, sympatric herbivores partition re-sources by feeding on different plants or different plant parts. Previous dental isotopic studies indicated that most NTC herbivores consumed C3 plants, including grasses. To test the hypothesis that resource partitioning occurred among grass-feeders at NTC, we collected mesowear data from both equids as well as Ovis, using samples collected by teams from the University of Kansas between 1974 and 1985.Assessed on upper cheek teeth, mesowear derives from either attritional (tooth on tooth) or abrasional (tooth on abrasive food) wear. The paracone and metacone were examined on each specimen to determine cusp shape (sharp, rounded, or blunt) and occlusal relief (high or low). A diet of non-abrasive material yields high and sharp cusps and one of heavily abrasive materials results in low and blunt cusps, while rounded cusps indicate in-termediate levels of abrasion. A large sample (N = 143) of equid teeth included two morphs. A smaller sample (N = 10) of Ovis teeth provided comparison with the equid teeth. Data collected consisted of individual variables of cusp heights and shape, as well as stages of mesowear combining both variables. Upper adult M1/2s and P4s were used.Results from the equid sample revealed that 8% exhibited high and sharp/rounded cusps, indicating little dietary abrasion; 58% had low and rounded cusps; and 34% had low and blunt cusps. The latter grouping is evidence for a highly abrasive diet. In the sample of Ovis, the results are strikingly different: 40% had high and sharp cusps and 60% had high and rounded cusps. Even though mountain sheep are often interpreted to be grass feeders, their mesowear suggests they did not eat an abrasive diet at NTC.The distribution of mesowear scores among the equid fossils conforms with an interpretation of two equid taxa at NTC, as well as supporting our hypothesis that these taxa partitioned grass resources. The very different nature of the mesowear signature seen in Ovis, compared to the equid fossils, also supports our hypothesis that these grass-feeders either consumed a more mixed or browse-dominated diet with different overall levels of abrasion, or else ate different parts of grass plants. As observed in the Serengeti grazing succession, we propose that equids may have moved through the area first, consuming taller, older, more abrasive parts of grass plants, followed by mountain sheep eating softer, younger plants.

AB  - Cranial endocasts are one of the most direct tools available to obtain information about the endocranial cavity of fossil mammals, but few anatomical comparisons have analyzed endocranial data within a phylogenetic framework. Our study combines analyses of new digital endocasts from high-resolution X-ray micro-computed tomography (mu CT) for two notoungulates, Cochilius sp. and Notostylops murinus, with data from published anatomical descriptions and endocasts (prior mu CT digital endocasts and natural and extracted plaster endocasts), resulting in 22 endocranial characters (11 new) scored on 20 notoungulates and five outgroups. These data permitted a comparative study of cranial endocasts of notoungulates, an enigmatic group of extinct South American mammals, shedding light on several important issues concerning their phylogenetic relationships. The new endocranial data were integrated into a craniodental and postcranial matrix, resulting in 259 characters across 65 taxa, the most comprehensive character and taxon sampling to date and the only one including a substantial suite of endocranial characters. We further performed ancestral state reconstructions for endocranial characters using parsimony optimization on the resulting phylogenetic trees. Body mass estimates and endocranial volumes were used to calculate Encephalization Quotients (EQs) and Phylogenetic Encephalization Quotients (PEQs), which then were optimized onto the phylogenies. Endocast data from ancestral character state reconstructions bear on relationships among meridiungulates, revealing that many endocast characters may be synapomorphies for Notoungulata and other clades within the group. Notoungulates, in general, display relatively low EQs when compared with Holarctic herbivorous mammals, potentially due to their long history of evolution in isolation in South America during the Cenozoic.

AB  - Animals may use long-distance foraging trips to capitalize on spatiotemporal variation in food availability, allowing individuals to maximize resource gain from foraging effort. This is particularly important for dimorphic species with polygynous mating where males face strong selection pressures to attain large size and access to reproductive females. We tracked 17 male Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, during their prolonged postbreeding trips and assessed links between their movements and environmental predictors of profitable feeding areas. Males made one of two types of trips: a long trip to the Antarctic ice edge or shorter trips to areas where the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current fronts generate high biological activity. The trip type was not determined by body size but was related to departure date from the breeding area, suggesting that males must trade off opportunities at the breeding area (reproductive, social interactions) and foraging opportunities between breeding seasons. Regardless of trip structure, males focused search effort far from foraging areas of central-place foraging seabirds and seals including female Antarctic fur seals provisioning offspring. Males showed clear spatiotemporal patterns in dive behaviour, with deep dives in shelf waters during the day and predominantly shallower dives in pelagic waters at night. Diel dive patterns showed monthly changes in photoperiod and lunar phase, consistent with feeding on vertically migrating prey. However, males did not use area-restricted search to focus dive effort, instead performing a mix of foraging and nonforaging behaviour within and between restricted search areas. We discuss the scale and type of inference that can be made from movement models, given the behavioural constraints that govern long-distance trips in vast, heterogeneous environments like the Southern Ocean.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Inadequately managed solid organic waste generation poses a threat to the environment and human health globally. Biotransformation with the black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) is emerging as talent technology for solid waste management. However, there is a lack of understanding of whether BSFL can effectively suppress potential pathogenic microorganisms during management and the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the temporal variations of microorganisms in two common types of solid waste, i.e., kitchen waste (KW) and pig manure (PM). Natural composting and composting with BSFL under three different pH levels (pH 5, 7, and 9) were established to explore their impact on microbial communities in compost and the gut of BSFL. The results showed that the compost of kitchen waste and pig manure led to an increase in relative abundance of various potentially pathogenic bacteria. Temporal gradient analyses revealed that the most substantial reduction in the relative abundance and diversity of potentially pathogenic microorganisms occurred when the initial pH of both two wastes were adjusted to 7 upon the introduction of BSFL. Through network and pls-pm analysis, it was discovered that the gut microbiota of BSFL occupied an ecological niche in the compost, inhibiting the proliferation of potentially pathogenic microorganisms.

AB  - The genus Lysmata Risso, 1816 includes five species in the Mediterranean Sea, namely two well-known species with an Atlantic-Mediterranean distribution, L. seticaudata (Risso, 1816) and L. nilita Dohrn & Holthuis, 1950, and three additional species only known from single records. These are L. kempi Chace, 1997 and L. vittata (Stimpson, 1860), alien species native to the Indo-Pacific region, and L. olavoi Fransen, 1991, a poorly known species originally described from the Azores (Atlantic Ocean) and only reported three decades ago from the eastern parts of the basin. Based on an integrative taxonomic approach, we report the first finding of an ovigerous female of L. olavoi from Italy (Gulf of Naples, Tyrrhenian Sea) and the entire western Mediterranean, thus confirming the presence of this species in the basin and filling a wide gap in its published distribution. It is possible that this taxon was present in the Mediterranean for centuries but went overlooked or undetected due to cryptic habits, occupancy of still unexplored habitats, or misidentification with the highly similar L. seticaudata. Results of phylogenetic analyses confirm the exclusion of L. olavoi by the major lysmatid groups and underline the necessity of multilocus approaches to disentangle its correct phylogenetic position. As the species is still surrounded by a number of unsolved ecological and phylogenetic questions, further field and laboratory work is required to shed light on them.

AB  - Despite the isolation of remote natural regions, it has been discovered that they are experiencing the accumulation of anthropogenic microparticles (i.e., microplastics or natural or semisynthetic cellulosic particles). Teide National Park (Canary Islands, Spain) is a high-mountain protected area known for its rich biodiversity. This study aims to assess the occurrence of coloured anthropogenic particles in the faecal matter of wild mammals, specifically rabbits and mouflons, residing in the park. With this purpose, faeces were collected from 68 systematically distributed sampling points. A stereomicroscopy-guided grinding process allowed a chemical-free and quick visual inspection of 616 individual excreta, revealing that 96% were particle-free. However, 37 anthropogenic particles were found, which correspond to 0.79 +/- 0.20 items per gram of dry faecal matter. The archetypical particle was a cellulosic blue microfibre of 2721 +/- 407 mu m, though poly(ethylene-vinyl acetate) and polypropylene were also identified via micro Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopic analysis. Atmospheric deposition and touristic pressure may be the sources of the anthropogenic particles, as they were randomly found in 36% of the sampling points. These findings represent the first evidence of anthropogenic particle ingestion by wild rabbits and mouflons, signifying the introduction of microplastics into terrestrial food chains in a remote high-mountain environment.

AB  - Sin Nombre virus (SNV) is a zoonotic virus that is highly pathogenic to humans. The deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, is the primary host of SNV, and SNV prevalence in P. maniculatus is an important indicator of human disease risk. Because the California Channel Islands contain permanent human settlements, receive hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, and can have extremely high densities of P. maniculatus, surveillance for SNV in island P. maniculatus is important for understanding the human risk of zoonotic disease. Despite the importance of surveillance on these heavily utilized islands, SNV prevalence (i.e. the proportion of P. maniculatus that test positive to antibodies to SNV) has not been examined in the last 13-27 years. We present data on 1,610 mice sampled for four consecutive years (2014-2017) on five of the California Channel Islands: East Anacapa, Santa Barbara, Santa Catalina, San Nicolas, and San Clemente. Despite historical data indicating SNV-positive mice on San Clemente and Santa Catalina, we detected no SNV-positive mice on these islands, suggesting very low prevalence or possible loss of SNV. Islands historically free of SNV (East Anacapa, Santa Barbara, and San Nicolas) remained free of SNV, suggesting that rates of pathogen introduction from other islands and/or the mainland are low. Although continued surveillance is warranted to determine whether SNV establishes on these islands, our work helps inform current human disease risk in these locations and suggests that SNV prevalence on these islands is currently very low.

AB  - Monitoring is critical for conservation, to track the status of threatened species, assess the relative impacts of threats, inform management responses and prioritise them according to their efficacy. Globally, freshwater fish are impacted by a range of threats including deterioration in water quality, climate change, habitat loss and degradation, introduced predators and herbivores, and wildfire. Monitoring of freshwater fish can be challenging because aquatic conditions can make detecting and identifying population trends difficult for many species. Galaxiidae is the most speciose family of Gondwanan-distributed freshwater fishes, and over 75% of species assessed by the IUCN Red List have been classified as threatened. Many Australian galaxiids are highly imperilled and monitoring effort and adequacy is low. We prepared a detailed monitoring plan for the Stocky Galaxias (Galaxias tantangara) that is representative of the conservation status and level of threat facing many congeneric and other similar species. Our protocol provides details of species biology, pertinent threats, and management options with sampling methods to gather these data, and options to link with management actions for maximum benefit. Improved monitoring linked with threat management should improve the conservation status of Stocky Galaxias. By providing this example, we have sought to improve monitoring for range-restricted freshwater fishes more generally.

AB  - Here, we combined archived mitochondrial sequences for Ponto-Caspian gobiids with new sequences from the south Caspian basin to assess and evaluate its gobioid diversity and taxonomy, and to provide a first mitochondrial-based phylogenetic and phylogeographic framework. We demonstrate that: (i) Proterorhinus nasalis is the tubenose goby taxon in the saline waters of the southern Caspian Sea, whereas the name Pr. semipellucidus for the Azov/northern Caspian Sea/Volga River populations is likely be resurrected depending on the outcome of an integrative taxonomical approach; (ii) the deep-water goby Ponticola bathybius should be re-assigned to the genus Neogobius, as it is the sistergroup of N. melanostomus; (iii) specimens previously identified as Po. cyrius and Po. iljini from the south Caspian basin appear conspecific with Po. iranicus and Po. gorlap, respectively, and should be omitted from the checklist of Iranian and south Caspian freshwater fishes; (iv) the low stand of the Caspian Sea during the Tyurkyanian regression is inferred to have led to the isolation and evolution of Po. iranicus; and (v) similarities in genetic background, and invasion history of Rhinogobius sp. and Pseudorasbora parva in Iran and Turkmenistan indicate that the initial introduction of both species into the region possibly originated from Japan in the 1980s.

AB  - Simple Summary The genetic diversity of southern African sheep remains under-studied. We present here the complete mitochondrial genomes of archaeological southern African sheep, as well as the genomes from three indigenous southern African breeds-Damara, Namaqua Afrikaner, and Ronderib Afrikaner. We show that southern African sheep exhibit limited genetic diversity which is consistent with our understanding of their migration south from northernmost Africa. Intriguingly, many of the modern sheep show close relationships with the archaeological sheep, implying an ancestor-descendant relationship. Similarly, the sheep that do not exhibit a close relationship with the archaeological sheep nonetheless cluster closely with each other and do not show a close relationship with European and Asian sheep. This suggests that they too are descendants of indigenous sheep and not the product of historic introductions of exotic breeds. We investigated the genetic diversity and historic relationships among southern African sheep as well as the relationships between them and sheep outside the continent by sourcing both archaeological and modern sheep samples. Archaeological sheep samples derived from the site Die Kelders 1, near Cape Town, date to approximately 1500 years ago. The modern samples were taken as ear snips from Damara, Namaqua Afrikaner, and Ronderib Afrikaner sheep on a farm in Prieska in the Northern Cape. Illumina sequencing libraries were constructed for both ancient and modern specimens. Ancient specimens were enriched for the mitochondrial genome using an in-solution hybridization protocol and modern specimens were subjected to shotgun sequencing. Sequences were mapped to the Ovis aries reference genome, assigned to haplogroups and subhaplogroups, and used to calculate a phylogenetic tree using previously published, geographically dispersed mitochondrial genome sheep sequences. Genetic diversity statistics show that southern African sheep have lower diversity than sheep in other regions. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that many modern southern African sheep are likely descended from prehistoric indigenous sheep populations and not from sheep imported from Europe during the historic period.

AB  - Due to the favorable climatic and ecological conditions offered by Colombian ecosystems, the hippo population introduced into the country in the 1980s has increased and now it has spread from the middle valley of the Magdalena River in Antioquia to the Momp & oacute;s Depression in Bol & iacute;var. Recently, the Colombian government declared it as an invasive species for its negative effects on the ecosystems and people's lives and livelihoods. In this context, we conducted a demographic study to estimate the population size and structure, describe its spatial distribution, and project the population dynamics into the future. We used direct and indirect records to estimate a population of at least 181 hippos distributed in seven groups, five in advanced stages of biological invasion. Given their current structure and size, the hippo population will reach 1,000 individuals around 2040 if no urgent eradication actions are taken.

AB  - This study investigates the nectar characteristics of the tall goldenrod (Solidago altissima L.), an introduced dominant fall-flowering herb in Japan. We found that the nectar volume of S. altissima peaked at approximately 13:00 before decreasing. Glucose and fructose were identified as the primary sugar components, followed by sucrose. The average sugar amount per panicle of naturally growing plants was estimated as 229.0 mg. Herbivory by the exotic lacebug (Corythucha marmorata) reduced the nectar volume per floret but did not affect the total sugar amount per floret. However, the sugar amount per panicle decreased substantially because C. marmorata reduced both the number of disc florets (i.e., nectar-secreting florets) per head and the number of heads per panicle. Plant genotypes also influenced some nectar traits, interacting with the effects of herbivory. As the distribution of C. marmorata continues to expand across Japan, the nectar resources provided by S. altissima may be diminishing nationwide.

AB  - Herbivorous macroinvertebrates make up a large fraction of secondary production in wetlands, but little is known about how water flow affects herbivorous macroinvertebrate production. Reintroducing measurable water flow (1-5 cm/s) to the oligotrophic (phosphorus-limited) Everglades has the potential to improve herbivorous macroinvertebrate production by providing a constant low supply of phosphorus (P) to periphyton and improving food quality. This study investigated potential effects of flow-mediated nutrient loading on growth rates of herbivorous grazers, juvenile apple snails (Pomacea maculata). Periphyton was grown on standard substrates, within a landscape-scale flow addition experiment, in two sloughs that received elevated velocities (3-5 cm/s) and two control sloughs. The flowing sloughs produced periphyton with greater biomass, higher concentrations of nutrients, and lower C:P ratios. Snails, in a laboratory setting, gained more than 3.7-fold greater total mass when fed periphyton from flowing sloughs than snails fed periphyton from control sloughs. Water column nutrients were slightly elevated in flowing sloughs, but the amount could not fully explain differences in periphyton nutrients or snail growth. Increasing flow above background conditions improved food quality, which subsequently increased growth rates. Restoring flow has the potential to increase nutrient accessibility that could enhance food webs, but additional study will be needed to determine whether increased growth rates translate into increased standing stocks.

AB  - The genomic architecture underlying the origins and maintenance of biodiversity is an increasingly accessible feature of species, due in large part to third-generation sequencing and novel analytical toolsets. Applying these techniques to woodrats (Neotoma spp.) provides a unique opportunity to study how herbivores respond to environmental change. Neotoma bryanti and N. lepida independently achieved a major dietary feat in the aftermath of a natural climate change event: switching to the novel, toxic food source creosote bush (Larrea tridentata). To better understand the genetic mechanisms underlying this ability, we employed a trio binning sequencing approach with a N. bryanti x N. lepida F-1 hybrid, allowing the simultaneous assembly of genomes representing each parental species. The resulting phased, chromosome-level, highly complete haploid references enabled us to explore the genomic architecture of several gene families-cytochromes P450, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters-known to play key roles in the metabolism of naturally occurring toxic dietary compounds. In addition to duplication events in the ABCG and UGT2B subfamilies, we found expansions in three P450 gene families (2A, 2B, 3A), including the evolution of multiple novel gene islands within the 2B and 3A subfamilies, which may have provided the crucial substrate for dietary adaptation. Our assemblies demonstrate that trio binning from an F-1 hybrid rodent effectively recovers parental genomes from species that diverged more than a million years ago.

AB  - The Longnan goat (LN) is a local breed discovered during the third census of China's livestock and poultry genetic resources. In order to thoroughly comprehend the population traits, this research examined a total of 70 animals from three different goat populations, namely the LN goat, Nanjiang Brown goat (NJ), and Boer goat (Boer). Specific-Locus Amplified Fragment Sequencing was employed to analyze genetic diversity, population structure, and selective sweep patterns. Additionally, individual DNA fingerprints were generated to provide detailed genetic profiles for each subject. A total of 643,868 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, with a majority located in intergenic and intronic regions. Genetic diversity analysis uncovered lower diversity within the LN population compared to the other two populations. The analysis of population structure unveiled significant genetic distance between LN and both NJ and Boer populations, with distinct clustering patterns observed. Moreover, genetic differentiation coefficients (F-ST) of 0.1019 and 0.0854 were determined between LN and Boer, as well as LN and NJ, respectively, indicating substantial genetic differentiation. Selective sweep analysis, combining F-ST and pi ratio, identified several genes associated with growth and development, reproduction, hair color, and immunity that may serve as valuable candidates for marker-assisted breeding. Furthermore, identification of 47,541 runs of homozygosity (ROHs) revealed non-uniform distribution across chromosomes, with the highest frequency on chromosome 1 and the lowest on chromosome 27. Correlations between different inbreeding coefficients varied, with the highest observed between F-HOM and F-GRM, and the lowest between F-ROH >1.5Mb and F-ROH <500kb. A total of 46 candidate genes were annotated within high-frequency ROH islands, primarily associated with biological processes such as reproduction, growth and development, and immunity. Finally, a DNA fingerprint, consisting of 371 highly polymorphic SNPs, was generated and presented in the form of a two-dimensional code for convenient access. Based on the population structure analysis, LN goats have been found to have a distant genetic distance and a higher degree of differentiation from both the Boer and NJ populations. Evaluation of genetic diversity parameters and ROH analysis indicates that the LN population exhibits lower genetic diversity and shows signs of inbreeding. Our findings offer theoretical support for the identification of genetic resources within this population.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is a synthetic compound utilized in industry for the production of various plastics. BPA penetrates into the environment and adversely affects living organisms. Therefore, the influence of various BPA dosages on the neurochemical characteristics of nerve fibers located in the aortic branch wall was investigated in this study utilizing a double immunofluorescence method. It was found that BPA in concentration of 0.5 mg/kg body weight/day causes a clear increase in the density of nerves within aortic branch walls immunoreactive to cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Nerves containing galanin (GAL) and/or somatostatin (SOM) did not change when BPA was introduced into the system. Changes noted after administration of BPA at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg body weight/day were less visible and concerned fibers immunoreactive to CART, CGRP, and/or PACAP. The obtained results show that BPA affects the neurochemical coding of nerves in the aortic branch wall. These fluctuations may be the first signs of the influence of this substance on blood vessels and may also be at the root of the disturbances in the cardiovascular system.

AB  - Simple Summary Yak is an indigenous ruminant on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and its meat is known as the "beef crown". Traditionally, yak graze on the rangeland all year round and without any supplementation, and weight loss would occur in the cold season, which leads to rather low productive performance. In recent years, the strategy of intensive feedlot fattening was introduced to the yak raising industry. However, the results were not as encouraging as in the cattle steers, a fact that can be attributed to yak malnutrition due to differences in feed varieties supply and nutrients requirement between yaks and cattle. Consequently, this study was conducted to examine the effect of the first two limiting amino acids on growth performance, carcass traits, and meat quality in feedlot yaks. The animals were offered total mixed ration with supplementary four levels of rumen-protected lysine and methionine throughout the whole experiment. The results showed that the average daily gain, feed to gain ratio, meat color, drip loss, and shear force were improved when yaks were supplemented with rumen-protected amino acid while the medium level was most promising. These results indicated that supplementary rumen-protected amino acid improved the growth performance and meat quality characteristics of fattening yaks in feedlot. Yak, a unique bovine species on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, has provided pastoralists with the basic materials of production and life for thousands of years. Existing literature showed that yak meat is of high nutritional value for humans whereas the growth performance is relatively low. As it has been demonstrated, lysine and methionine are the two key limiting amino acids in ruminants. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effect of supplementary levels of rumen-protected lysine (RPL) and methionine (RPM) on growth performance, carcass traits, and meat quality in feedlot yaks. Thirty-two male yaks, with initial body weight (IBW) of 237.5 +/- 13.99 kg were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments (n = 8), including control group (CON; basal diet without adding rumen-protected amino acid (RPAA)), low RPAA supplementation group (Group Low; basal diet supplemented with RPL (30.0 g/animal/day) and RPM (7.5 g/animal/day)), medium RPAA supplementation group (Group Medium; basal diet supplemented with RPL (50.0 g/animal/day) and RPM (12.5 g/animal/day)), and high RPAA supplementation group (Group High; basal diet supplemented with RPL (70.0 g/animal/day) and RPM (17.5 g/animal/day)). The average daily gain was increased linearly (p < 0.001) and quadratically (p < 0.01) while feed to gain ratio was decreased linearly (p < 0.001) and quadratically (p < 0.001) with the increasing RPAA supplementation, and the average daily gain was higher while feed to gain ratio was lower in RPAA than CON (p < 0.001). Meat color L* values and b* were decreased linearly (p < 0.01) with the increase of RPAA supplementation, and b* was lower in RPAA than CON (p < 0.05). Meat color a* value was increased linearly (p < 0.05) with the increasing RPAA supplementation, and a* was higher in RPAA than CON (p < 0.05). The 24 h drip loss and shear force were decreased quadratically (p < 0.01) with the increasing RPAA supplementation, and drip loss and shear force values were lower in RPAA than CON (p < 0.05). The glycine concentration in longissimus dorsi (LD) increased linearly (p < 0.05) with the increasing RPAA supplementation.
   These results demonstrated that both the growth performance and meat quality characteristics were improved in feedlot yaks as an effect of the dietary supplementation with RPL and RPM, and the medium supplementary level is recommended, since it showed the most promising results.

AB  - Integrated farm management (IFM) is promoted as a whole farm approach toward Agriculture 4.0, incorporating smart farming technologies for attempting to limit livestock production's negative impacts on the environment while increasing productivity with regard to the economic viability of rural communities. The Internet of Things (IoT) may serve as an enabler to ensure key properties-such as interconnectivity, scalability, agility, and interoperability-in IFM systems so that they could provide object-based services while adapting to dynamic changes. This paper focuses on the problem of facilitating the management, processing, and sharing of the vast and heterogeneous data points generated in livestock facilities by introducing distributed IoT middleware as the core of a responsive and adaptive service-oriented IFM system, specifically targeted to enable smart livestock farming in view of its unique requirements. The proposed IoT middleware encompasses the context-awareness approach via the integration of a flexible ontology-based structure for modeling and reasoning. The IoT middleware was assessed in actual conditions on the grounds of a case study for smart control of the thermal environment in a medium-sized pig farming facility. As derived from the obtained evaluation results, the system appears to perform quite satisfactorily in terms of computational performance as well as ontology coherence, consistency, and efficiency.

AB  - Controlling the growth of fouling organisms in coral aquaculture is a recognised approach to enhance survival during grow-out of recruits. Herbivorous fish can reduce algae growth, though indiscriminate grazing by the fish pose a risk to the early life stages of corals. To identify a suitable age or size to introduce fish to coral recruit culture, settlement tiles with 1-week-old, single-polyp and 1-month-old, multi-polyp Acropora millepora, Acropora kenti and Goniastrea retiformis were exposed to "brusher", "cropper" and "concealed cropper" fish grazers for 24 h, in addition to a manual aquarist cleaned treatment and a control uncleaned treatment for comparison. In general, acroporid recruits displayed lower mortality than Goniastrea recruits across all types of grazing, and younger, smaller recruits were more vulnerable to grazing, with the "brusher" fish functional group more likely to cause mortality. Morality was low in the uncleaned controls for all corals, whilst single-polyp recruits generally saw slightly elevated mortality under manual aquarist cleaning. Grazing by the "brusher" Ctenochaetus binotatus resulted in the highest mortality across all treatments with week old, single-polyp recruits experiencing 2.5% and 8.6% mortality for A. millepora and A. kenti, respectively, and as high as 88.9% mortality for G. retiformis. In contrast, month old acroporids that were 2-7 polyps in size displayed < 1% probability of mortality when exposed to the same C. binotatus grazing. Grazing intensity of the fish also played a role, as fish belonging to the same functional group with higher bite rates caused higher recruit mortality. Overall, "cropper" Acanthurus nigrofuscus represented the best trade-off between minimising recruit mortality whilst reducing algae coverage on the settlement tiles. Based on our results and knowledge of coral recruit growth, coral grow-out operations would gain the most benefit by introducing fish grazers once corals reach the multi-polyp stage at > 1 month old for acroporids and other fast growing species, and later for smaller, slower growing species such as G. retiformis.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is a lethal hemorrhagic disease that affects domestic pigs and wild boars. There is no medication available for ASF to date. The ability to mount antigen-specific responses to viral vectored CP312R makes it a crucial potential target for designing vaccines or drugs. This study determined the crystal structure of ASFV CP312R at 2.32 A and found it to be a monomer with a single-stranded DNA binding core domain with a clear five-strands b-barrel OB-fold architecture. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and size-exclusion chromatography characterization assay further confirmed the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding property of ASFV CP312R. This study revealed the structure and preliminary ssDNA interaction mechanisms of ASFV CP312R, providing new clues for developing new antiviral strategies. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ash (Fraxinus spp.) is in rapid decline across the northeastern USA due to the invasive emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire). Three recently co-occurring confamilial species may serve as alternative larval host plants for ash-reliant Lepidoptera. These prospective hosts are nonnative shrubs often planted in managed suburban landscapes and are sometimes invasive or naturalized in North America. Given the imminent decline of ash trees, we considered potential downstream effects on insect herbivores historically specialized on ash foliage. We measured the performance of three ash-specialist hawkmoths (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) on native white ash (Fraxinus americana L.) and alternative host plants: common lilac (Syringa vulgaris L.), weeping forsythia [Forsythia suspensa (Thunb.) Vahl], and European privet (Ligustrum vulgare L.). We found the nonnative host plants provided varied support for larval survival to pupation, with biomass and growth rate affected differently by both plant and insect identity. Nearly all caterpillars reared on one alternative host, European privet, exhibited distinct malformations of the wing buds at pupation. Given caterpillar presence on privet in the field, privet may constitute an ecological trap (i.e., when female moths select a sub-optimal host, offspring survival and fitness are reduced). This work demonstrates how performance testing can reveal species-specific effects of host plant loss on mono- or oligophagous insects. For some ash specialists, alternative nonnative host plants may be suboptimal, but some cultivated host plants may be able to support certain specialist insects during native host decline. We suggest that landscaping decisions can be tailored to support threatened insect species.

AB  - In recent years, the northern Bering Sea (NBS) fish assemblage has changed, where rising water temperatures have correlated with increases in abundance of sub-arctic fish species. One such species is the Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), a commercially important flatfish that has largely been unstudied within the NBS. To assess Pacific halibut within the region, we attached pop-up satellite telemetry tags on large individuals in the NBS during the summer months. Our objectives were to characterize depths and temperatures occupied by Pacific halibut, identify the timing, magnitude, and destination of Pacific halibut migratory movements, and assess the scale of those movements compared to current management practice. Tagged Pacific halibut remained within the Bering Sea but made relatively large-scale seasonal movements within the basin. During autumn, all Pacific halibut made offshore migrations to the continental shelf edge, reaching as far south as the Pribilof Islands and as far north as Russian waters along the Kamchatka Peninsula. Individuals remained in offshore waters throughout the winter, likely for spawning purposes, where they occupied conditions as cold as - 1.9 degrees C and as deep as 696 m. Fish returned to relatively warm, shallow waters near their initial tagging locations in early summer, an indication of inter-annual site fidelity and homing to NBS foraging areas. This study provides the first evaluation of Pacific halibut at their northernmost extent, with findings indicating that individuals in the NBS display fine-scale spatial dynamics representative of migratory foraging contingent behavior.

AB  - Models of migratory behavior predict trade-offs between fitness costs and benefits with respect to migration distance. Shorter migration distances may confer a fitness benefit by facilitating earlier breeding, however this is rarely investigated. We tested this hypothesis using a large-scale geolocation (GLS) dataset from 109 rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata), a differentially migrating seabird, that was tagged at 12 breeding colonies along the Pacific Coast of North America, spanning southern California to the eastern Aleutian Islands, Alaska. Using GLS-based position estimates, we determined the geographic centroid of the pelagic areas occupied by birds in winter (1 January-28 February) and then calculated the distance between their wintering centroids and colony of origin. We then used GLS light-intensity and salt-water immersion (wet/dry) data to determine each individual's date of egg-laying the following spring. Rhinoceros auklets were very widely distributed across the northeastern Pacific Ocean in winter. Among all individuals, the distance between winter centroids and breeding colonies ranged from < 100 to > 2500 km, being greater among individuals originating from colonies at higher latitudes. As predicted, migration distance and colony latitude were positively related to lay date: after accounting for colony-level differences in phenology, individuals that migrated shorter distances tended to lay their eggs earlier, a pattern that emerged across all populations. Our study links the migration distance of rhinoceros auklets to a fitness-related outcome, underscoring the selective pressure that migration exerts on subsequent breeding activity.

AB  - Phytochemical diversity is an effective plant defensive attribute, but much more research has focused on genetic and environmental controls of specific defensive compounds than phytochemical diversity per se. Documenting plasticity in phytochemical richness and plant chemical composition as opposed to individual compounds is important for understanding plant defense. This study outlines a multi-site transplant experiment in Cerrado gallery forests in central Brazil, utilizing Piper arboreum (Piperaceae), a prevalent and widespread neotropical shrub. Clones from four distinct populations were planted either at their origin site or in a different forest. Secondary metabolite composition varied between populations initially and then changed after transplanting. Interestingly, clones with chemical profiles that were distinct from the populations where they were introduced experienced reduced specialist chrysomelid herbivory compared to clones that were more chemically similar to the existing P. arboreum populations where they were planted. Specialist Lepidoptera herbivory also declined in clones transplanted to a new forest, but this change could not be ascribed to chemical profiles. In contrast, generalist herbivory was unaffected by chemical dissimilarity and transplanting. This research adds to the expanding body of evidence suggesting that phytochemical diversity is a dynamic trait exerting unique effects on different herbivore guilds.

AB  - Animal vocalizations encode rich biological information-such as age, sex, behavioural context and emotional state-making bioacoustic analysis a promising non-invasive method for assessing welfare and population demography. However, traditional bioacoustic approaches, which rely on manually defined acoustic features, are time-consuming, require specialized expertise and may introduce subjective bias. These constraints reduce the feasibility of analysing increasingly large datasets generated by passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). Transfer learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offers a scalable alternative by enabling automatic acoustic feature extraction without predefined criteria. Here, we applied four pre-trained CNNs-two general purpose models (VGGish and YAMNet) and two avian bioacoustic models (Perch and BirdNET)-to African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) recordings. We used a dimensionality reduction algorithm (UMAP) to represent the extracted acoustic features in two dimensions and evaluated these representations across three key tasks: (1) call-type classification (rumble, roar and trumpet), (2) rumble sub-type identification and (3) behavioural and demographic analysis. A Random Forest classifier trained on these features achieved near-perfect accuracy for rumbles, with Perch attaining the highest average accuracy (0.85) across all call types. Clustering the reduced features identified biologically meaningful rumble sub-types-such as adult female calls linked to logistics-and provided clearer groupings than manual classification. Statistical analyses showed that factors including age and behavioural context significantly influenced call variation (P < 0.001), with additional comparisons revealing clear differences among contexts (e.g. nursing, competition, separation), sexes and multiple age classes. Perch and BirdNET consistently outperformed general purpose models when dealing with complex or ambiguous calls. These findings demonstrate that transfer learning enables scalable, reproducible bioacoustic workflows capable of detecting biologically meaningful acoustic variation. Integrating this approach into PAM pipelines can enhance the non-invasive assessment of population dynamics, behaviour and welfare in acoustically active species.

AB  - The high extinction risk of Australian marsupials has been attributed to their failure to recognise novel predators, the application of inappropriate antipredator responses, and advanced hunting strategies of novel predators. This study is a preliminary attempt to explore whether the Lumholtz' tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus lumholtzi) (a) is able to recognise odour cues from different predators as threats, and (b) possesses predator-archetype specific antipredator responses. A small number of available captive tree-kangaroos were exposed to faecal odours from two extant predators of different archetypes (python, dingo), a regionally extinct predator which closely matches past terrestrial predators (Tasmanian devil), and a novel predator (domestic dog). Lavender oil was used as non-predator novel odour and water as control. Results suggest that all subjects associated the presented odours with a threat, albeit to different degrees, but did not display predator-archetype specific responses. It appears that this species applies an ancestral antipredator response of flight-on-the ground when encountering predators, including novel predators. Although the results need to be confirmed with more animals, further studies on the vulnerability of Australian prey to novel predators should take the ancestral history of Australian prey species into account.

AB  - This work aims to assess the utility of World-View 3 satellite imagery of 31 cm resolution for con-ducting population censuses of southern elephant seals (SES). For the first time, we present a comparison of the results of image analyses of a 31 cm resolution satellite image and 1.39 cm res-olution drone-based orthophoto of a SES breeding colony located at Patelnia Point (King George Island, breeding season 2019). The time distance separating both visualisations of the same area was 15 h 4 min, which allowed us to determine the female recognition from the VHR image with an error of 1.5-7.0%, depending on the density of females in the breeding formation. An impor-tant component of this error is false negative matches, which can have a significant impact when selecting the objects needed to train deep learning models. In addition, the pup recognition error was much higher and was 24.6-40.2%, which depended on the density of animals in harems, a large variation in the size of the pups and the diverse substrate on which they were deposited. Counting on VHR images was performed manually by eleven observers familiar with the morpho-logical characteristics of SES. The resolution of the VHR photo allows the identification of fe-males and males involved in breeding due to the clear dimorphism of their sizes. We recommend using VHR satellite imagery to determine the number of breeding formations and spatial relation-ships between them, as well as for counting females and males during the breeding haul-out. The resolution of satellite imagery available at this time is still insufficient to be used to determine breeding success. With increasing access to satellite resources and an ever-expanding database of VHR images, this is a promising tool to fill the gaps in knowledge about the global population of SESs.

AB  - Macroalgal beds are increasingly recognised as nursery habitats for coral reef fish; however, the extent to which they are used as a source of food and/or a refuge from predation remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the distribution, feeding behaviour, diet, and predation risk for juvenile rabbitfish in macroalgal habitats on Orpheus Island, Great Barrier Reef. Visual surveys revealed that juvenile and adult Siganus doliatus had different among-habitat distributions with juveniles being largely restricted to the reef flat and positively associated with macroalgal cover, while adults were abundant on the reef crest. Focal feeding observations show that within macroalgal habitats, juvenile S. doliatus targeted epiphytes on Sargassum (80% of bites), with relatively few bites taken on turfs or the Sargassum itself (27% and 8%, respectively). These observations were supported by stomach content analyses with filamentous algae being the dominant item in the stomach content of both small (< 4 cm total length, TL; 58%) and large juvenile S. doliatus (> 4 cm TL; 47%). The stomach content of juvenile S. doliatus, S. canaliculatus, and S. spinus collected from macroalgal habitats was similar, consisting primarily of filamentous algae and detritus. We found no relationship between the abundance of potential predators and juvenile rabbitfishes across the study sites. Collectively, our results suggest that juvenile rabbitfishes are using macroalgal habitats on this, and potentially other, inshore reefs as a food source and add to a growing body of literature highlighting the importance of these habitats for the early life stages of reef fish.

AB  - Although there are several nuisance species of serpulids reported worldwide, the present study shows that some of them have been overlooked even in geographic areas that are considered well studied. We report for the first time in Majorca the invasive species Ficopomatus enigmaticus and the first records for the Balearic Islands of the also non-native species Hydroides dianthus, H. dirampha, H. elegans and H. nigra. The most abundant species were F. enigmaticus, found at higher densities in Portixol (with up to 280 ind. m(-2)), and H. elegans, found at highest densities in the port of Palma (with up to 270 ind. m(-2)). Species have been identified after morphological examination and corroborated by mitochondrial DNA sequence data: cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and cytochrome b (Cytb). Molecular data show that the same haplotypes have been found in distant and disjoint biogeographic areas worldwide, which is only explicable by unintentional translocation of specimens through vectors (i.e. ship hulls or ballast water). Species delimitation analyses support previous findings that species complexes are common in both Ficopomatus and Hydroides. In fact, only among the Majorcan samples were we able to detect three species of the F. enigmaticus species complex, two of the H. elegans species complex and two of the H. dianthus species complex. The genetic distances between members of the F. enigmaticus species complex are 8.7% to 16.7% in COI sequences. The species of Hydroides hold 5.4% to 47.6 % genetic divergence between species of the same complex.

AB  - Nest predation is the primary cause of nest failure across many bird species. Interventions to support declining or threatened species frequently involve measures to reduce nest predation, through lethal control or non-lethal methods. However, their efficacy relies on a robust understanding of predator identity. The development of unobtrusive, infrared digital video surveillance now allows the identity of nest predators to be confirmed directly. Here, we collate and analyse nest-camera studies from England, Wales, Scotland and the Isle of Man, which are dominated by anthropogenic landscapes and lack most apex predators, but have a high abundance of mesopredators. We quantify the contribution of predator class and functional groups across groups of prey species, nesting habitats or nest strata. For quantitative analysis we collated 46 nest predation studies, comprising 2088 nests and 609 predation events across 24 avian prey species. Nest predation studies are not yet representative, mostly comprising waders (Charadriiformes) and a few passerines, in grassland and woodland habitats, respectively, with farmland and urban habitats poorly sampled. Wader clutches were predominantly predated by mammals (primarily European Badger Meles meles and Red Fox Vulpes vulpes and, particularly on islands, European Hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus; together 53% of events), but with non-trivial contributions by ungulates (6%), predominantly Sheep Ovis aries. For passerines, clutches were predated by corvids (31% of events) and mammals (primarily Badger, Hedgehog and Fox, 25% combined). Compared with depredation of passerine clutches, passerine broods were taken by a wider range of predators, particularly avian predators, predominantly Eurasian Jay Garrulus glandarius (23% of events, though noting 73% of songbird predation events were in woodland) and raptors (21%), but also reptiles. Despite the attention given to impacts of Grey Squirrel Sciurus carolinensis, its contribution to observed nest predation was negligible. Further work is required to expand understanding of nest predator identity, to improve understanding of changing predator influences across populations, so that, where appropriate for conservation, management strategies can be better informed.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is the cause of the most severe economic losses in the pig industry worldwide. PRRSV is extremely diverse in Europe, which poses a significant challenge to disease control within a country or any region. With the combination of phylogenetic reconstruction and network analysis, we aimed to uncover the major routes of the dispersal of PRRSV clades within Hungary. In brief, by analyzing >2600 ORF5 sequences, we identified at least 12 clades (including 6 clades within lineage 1 and 3 clades within lineage 3) common in parts of Western Europe (including Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands) and identified 2 novel clades (designated X1 and X2). Of interest, some genetic clades unique to other central European countries, such as the Czech Republic and Poland, were not identified. The pattern of PRRSV clade distribution is consistent with the route of the pig trade among countries, showing that most of the identified clades were introduced from Western Europe when fatteners were transported to Hungary. As a result of rigorous implementation of the national eradication program, the swine population was declared officially free from PRRSV. This map of viral diversity and clade distribution will serve as valuable baseline information for the maintenance of PRRSV-free status in the post-eradication era.

AB  - Land use in the catchments draining to the Great Barrier Reef lagoon has changed considerably since the introduction of livestock grazing, various crops, mining and urban development. Together these changes have resulted in increased pollutant loads and impaired coastal water quality. This study compiled records to produce annual time-series since 1860 of human population, livestock numbers and agricultural areas at the scale of surface drainage river basins, natural resource management regions and the whole Great Barrier Reef catchment area. Cattle and several crops have experienced progressive expansion interspersed by declines associated with droughts and diseases. Land uses which have experienced all time maxima since the year 2000 include cattle numbers and the areas of sugar cane, bananas and cotton. A Burdekin Basin case study shows that sediment loads initially increased with the introduction of livestock and mining, remained elevated with agricultural development, and declined slightly with the Burdekin Falls Dam construction.

AB  - Ants protect plants from herbivores in exchange for extrafloral nectar, but they can also disrupt pollination by visiting flowers and deterring pollinators, thereby reducing plant fitness. The Distraction Hypothesis suggests that extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) attract ants away from flowers to mitigate pollination disruption. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by conducting an ant exclusion experiment in Ferocactus recurvus to evaluate the impact of ants on plant fecundity (seed production). Ant presence in flowers was associated with reduced seed production and overall plant fecundity, as flowers visited by ants produced fewer seeds and were smaller in size compared to ant-excluded flowers. According to the hypothesis, an increased number of EFNs was associated with a lower likelihood of ants visiting the flowers. Ferocactus recurvus plants produces EFNs with high-sucrose nectar for plant defense and to reduce conflicts between ants and pollinators. Plant width was positively correlated with the number of EFNs and flowers, and there was an optimal number of EFNs that attracted a higher number of ants, thereby keeping them away from flowers. Overall, our findings highlight the complex and dynamic nature of interactions between plants, ants, and pollinators, and the potential trade-offs that exist between ant protection and pollinator attraction. Our findings suggest that while ants can protect plants, their presence can also negatively impact plant reproduction, and EFNs play a key role in managing this balance by reducing conflicts between ants and pollinators.

AB  - Long-term pre-release evaluations of how invasive plants respond to herbivory in introduced ranges can help identify the most effective biological control agents. However, most evaluations have been conducted within only one generation of introduced invasive species. This study tested effects across seven generations of simulated herbivory (i.e., defoliation) and habitat types on the invasive weed Alternanthera philoxeroides. We found total biomass of A. philoxeroides was decreased by defoliation during the first three generations when grown in a simulated aquatic habitat, but was decreased by defoliation only in the first generation when grown in a simulated terrestrial habitat. Defoliation significantly decreased stem diameter and collenchyma thickness and increased cortex thickness and total phenol production in A. philoxeroides grown in a simulated terrestrial or aquatic habitat during the first generation, but showed little effect during the following six successive generations. The associations between stem anatomical structural parameters and biomass significantly differed between non-defoliation and defoliation treatments in the simulated aquatic habitat, but not in the simulated terrestrial habitat. Our results suggest simulated herbivory exerted successful biological control on A. philoxeroides during the first generation in a simulated terrestrial habitat and the first three generations in a simulated aquatic habitat, but failed to restrain the vegetative offspring of A. philoxeroides. This failure of long-term biological control on A. philoxeroides might be caused by changes in the stem anatomical structure and compensatory growth. Our study highlights the need for long-term pre-release evaluation when testing the efficiency of biological control agents.

AB  - Live capture-recapture is often considered the gold standard for estimating wildlife population size or density, but the approach can be limited by permitting requirements, required labor, welfare concerns, and biased estimates resulting from heterogeneity in individual behavior. Noninvasive genetic sampling (e.g., from fecal pellets) offers a powerful alternative approach, but this method's success varies among taxa, with little research available on its use in rodents. Here, we addressed a series of questions to develop a noninvasive genetic sampling approach for the endangered giant kangaroo rat ( Dipodomys ingens ): (1) how quickly does DNA degrade in natural conditions, (2) how many pellets are required to recover a genotype, (3) how often do multiple individuals contaminate a pooled sample from a single sampling location, and (4) how do variable and parameter estimates from noninvasive genetic sampling compare to live-trapping mark-recapture estimates? We found that fecal pellets were successfully genotyped up to 9 days (estimated probability of recovery = 0.78) after exposure to hot, arid conditions, but that rate fell precipitously soon after. Although giant kangaroo rats are territorial, multiple individuals deposited fecal pellets at the same sampling locations; however, single pellets contained sufficient DNA to recover genotypes and to identify individuals, so contamination was not a problem for this approach. Capture probabilities were lower using noninvasive genetic sampling ( = 0.26, SE = 0.01) than live trapping ( = 0.40, SE = 0.06). Population estimates were generally similar using noninvasive genetic sampling, although they were quite a bit higher ( = 64 , = 38) on one grid. Noninvasive genetic sampling can overcome many of the limitations of live-trapping for small mammals, but the approach should be tested in additional taxa and systems to provide more generalizable recommendations for sampling schemes.

AB  - Abiotic resource limitation presents organisms with a dilemma about how to use resources when they become available. Characterizing how resource allocation affects investment in growth or defensive traits that affect organismal survival strategies allows us to understand the environmental contexts in which species interact. Our goal was to measure how macronutrient availability drives nitrogen and phosphorus allocation towards functional growth and defensive chemical traits of the Neotropical passion vine, Passiflora biflora. We investigated this question with a paired field study in La Selva, Costa Rica and a full factorial greenhouse experiment to determine whether the concentration of a key secondary chemical defence is driven by nitrogen availability. We correlated defensive chemical concentration with soil nitrogen availability in naturally occurring plants, measured the effects of nitrogen and phosphorus availability on growth and secondary chemical defence traits in the greenhouse and characterized the P. biflora leaf metabolome to assess how nutrient availability affected shifts in metabolism related to plant fitness. We found that nutrient allocation increased the magnitude of both growth and defence traits. Increased nitrogen availability resulted in higher concentrations of toxic leaf secondary chemicals, longer vines, greater biomass and more leaves with a superior ability to capture sunlight. In addition, plants from high nitrogen environments had metabolomes with significantly greater secondary metabolite richness and biochemical pathway diversity, as well as increases in the number of metabolites from several chemical classes related to basic cell function and defence. Nutrient availability had no significant effect on the richness and diversity of primary metabolites involved in basic cell functions. A direct comparison of the relative strength of quantitative growth and secondary defence traits indicated that P. biflora favours nutrient allocation to growth at low nitrogen levels but invests in both strategies more evenly as nitrogen availability increases. These findings lead us to predict that passion vines are better prepared to tolerate and resist herbivory when nutrients are plentiful and experience a trade-off between growth and chemical defence against natural enemies when they are scarce. These findings are consistent with both the 'escape' and 'defend' syndromes that are often used to describe tropical plant survival strategies. This is one of the only studies to measure nutrient allocation in vines, a group comprising a significant percentage of global plant diversity. Moreover, this work demonstrated the power of leveraging untargeted metabolomics to characterize how nutrient addition affects plant growth and defence, highlighting its potential for understanding functional trait variation.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.
   La limitacion de recursos abioticos presenta a los organismos con un dilema sobre como utilizar los recursos cuando estan disponibles. Caracterizar como la asignacion de recursos afecta la inversion en rasgos de crecimiento o defensa que influyen en las estrategias de supervivencia de los organismos nos permite entender los contextos ambientales en los que interactuan las especies. Nuestro objetivo fue medir como la disponibilidad de macronutrientes afecta la asignacion de nitrogeno y fosforo hacia caracteristicas de crecimiento funcional y quimicos defensivos de la enredadera neotropical Passiflora biflora. Investigamos esta pregunta con un estudio de campo en La Reserva Biologica La Selva, Costa Rica, y un experimento de invernadero con factorial completo para determinar si la concentracion de una defensa quimica secundaria esta afectada por la disponibilidad de nitrogeno. Correlacionamos la concentracion de productos quimicos defensivos con la disponibilidad de nitrogeno en el suelo en plantas que ocurren naturalmente, medimos los efectos de la disponibilidad de nitrogeno y fosforo en el crecimiento y las caracteristicas de defensa quimica secundaria en el invernadero, y caracterizamos el metaboloma (perfil quimico total) de las hojas de P. biflora para observar como la disponibilidad de nutrientes afecto los cambios en el metabolismo relacionados con la defensa de la planta. Encontramos que la asignacion de nutrientes aumento la magnitud tanto de los caracteristicas de crecimiento como de defensa. Una mayor disponibilidad de nitrogeno resulto en concentraciones mas altas de productos quimicos secundarios toxicos en las hojas, en endredederas mas largas, mayor masa y hojas con una capacidad superior para capturar la luz solar. Ademas, las plantas crecidas con alto contenido de nitrogeno tenian metabolomas con una riqueza de metabolitos secundarios significativamente mayor y una mayor diversidad de vias bioquimicas, asi como un aumento en el numero de metabolitos de varias clases quimicas relacionadas con la funcion celular basica y la defensa. La disponibilidad de nutrientes no tuvo un efecto significativo en la riqueza y diversidad de metabolitos primarios involucrados en funciones celulares basicas. Una comparacion directa de la fuerza relativa de los caracteristicas de crecimiento y defensa secundaria indico que P. biflora prefiere la asignacion de nutrientes al crecimiento en niveles bajos de nitrogeno, pero invierte en ambas estrategias de manera mas igual a medida que aumenta la disponibilidad de nitrogeno. Estos resultados nos llevan a predecir que las Passiflora estan mejor preparadas para tolerar y resistir el herbivorismo cuando los nutrientes son abundantes, y tienen un intercambio entre el crecimiento y la defensa quimica contra los enemigos naturales cuando los nutrients son pobres. Estos resultados son consistentes tanto con los sindromes de 'escape' y 'defence' que muchos utilizan para describir las estrategias de supervivencia de las plantas tropicales. Este es uno de los pocos estudios que miden la asignacion de nutrientes en enredaderas, un grupo que tiene un porcentaje grande de la diversidad vegetal global. Ademas, este trabajo demostro el poder de aprovechar la metabolomica para caracterizar como la adicion de nutrientes afecta el crecimiento y la defensa de las plantas, mostrando su potencial para entender la variacion en los caracteristicas funcionales.

AB  - Morphological variability in response to environmental features is an important feature of alien species, increasing their adaptive capabilities and facilitating naturalization in new habitats. The prussian carp Carassius gibelio is currently very widespread in the world. Much of its current range is believed to be acquired as a result of human activity, with the prussian carp recognized as an invasive species capable of having a significant impact on recipient ecosystems. On the territory of Uzbekistan, prussian carp has been known in the lower reaches of the Syr-Darya and Amu-Darya since the 4th millennium BC, and was also recorded in the first half of the 20th century. However, its numbers were not large. In the 1960s, the Amur form of the prussian carp was introduced into the water bodies of Uzbekistan, as a result of a targeted introduction from the "Savvino" fish farm near Moscow and the accidental import of herbivorous fish with juveniles from the Russian Far East, after which its unauthorized resettlement began with planting material of cultivated cyprinids. In the 1970s, prussian carp found their way into the Charvak Reservoir. This is a mountain cold-water reservoir, formed on the Chirchik River (the right tributary of the Syrdarya River) and is located between the spurs of the Western Tien-Shan. With an area of only 37 km2, 2 , it has a volume of about 2 km3 3 and a depth of more than 50 m. The reservoir is characterized by summer drawdown of the water level used for irrigation in the river valley Chirchik. This causes an almost complete absence of vegetation in the water area of the reservoir. Despite the atypical conditions, the prussian carp formed a self-sustaining population. There is none below the reservoir dam to the middle reaches of the Chirchik River. Indicators of counting characteristics of prussian carp in reservoir are D III-IV 17-19; A II 5-6; 26-30 (average 29) scales in the lateral line; on the first gill arch, 40-53 (on average 48) gill rakers and generally correspond to the characteristics in this climatic zone. Indices of plastic characteristics, both in traditional morphological analysis (see Table 1 ) and in the analysis of morphometric distances according to the "truss protocol" assessment method ( see Table 2 ), do not have pronounced differences from the indicators of prussian carp living in a lowland reservoir Tudakul and in the fish ponds of the fish hatchery of the Research Institute of Fisheries of Uzbekistan. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the cyt b gene of prussian carp from the Charvak reservoir showed their similarity with samples from the upper reaches of the Yangtze river, China ( see Table 3 ), which proves Far Eastern origin of prussian carp ih the Charvak reservoir. It is likely that it was the prussian carp, brought from the Far East, that ensured the growth in the number of the species in Uzbekistan. The question of the breadth of distribution of the Amur form of prussian carp in the region and the preservation of its native form currently remains open and requires further research using molecular genetic methods.

AB  - ContextSeascape connectivity refers to how the spatial configuration of marine habitats facilitates or hinders the movement of organisms, nutrients, materials or energy. Predicting and ranking potential connectivity among habitat patches for coral reef fishes helps to understand how reef fishes could utilize and connect multiple habitat types through the flow of nutrients, energy and biomass across the wider seascape during foraging movements.ObjectivesTo advance a spatially explicit understanding of connectivity linkages within a tropical atoll system by modeling, mapping and quantifying potential seascape connectivity for two locally abundant herbivorous reef fish species, the parrotfish, Chlorurus spilurus (pahoro hohoni or pa'ati pa'apa'a auahi), and the surgeonfish, Acanthurus triostegus (manini).MethodsWe applied a two-step modeling approach by first mapping habitat suitability for the focal species. A graph-theoretic modeling technique was then applied to model and measure the contribution of benthic habitat patches to species-specific potential connectivity within the seascape.ResultsHabitat suitability was higher and less fragmented for C. spilurus than for A. triostegus. Potential ecological connectivity estimates for C. spilurus were higher across the entire seascape, with differences between species likely driven by local-scale benthic habitat patch configuration and species home ranges. Hotspots of ecological connectivity across the atoll were mapped for both species.ConclusionsDespite advances in the application of graph-theoretic techniques in the coastal environment, few marine conservation and restoration measures currently integrate spatial information on ecological connectivity. This two-step spatial modeling approach holds great potential for rapid application of connectivity modeling at multiple spatial scales, which may predict ecological responses to conservation actions including active habitat restoration.

AB  - White-nose syndrome (WNS), caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), has led to significant mortality and species endangerment in North America. Bats in eastern China, however, carry low loads of Pd and do not exhibit disease, suggesting natural resistance. To explore potential defenses, we isolated and screened antagonistic bacteria from the wing membranes of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum for their ability to inhibit Pd growth. We employed the plate delineation isolation method to obtain 74 single strains, which were then screened for antagonistic effects through contact and non-contact inhibition experiments. A total of 18 antagonistic strains were isolated. After sequencing and comparison with the NCBI database, we identified eight known species and three unidentified species of antagonistic bacteria: Pseudomonas carnis, Buttiauxella ferragutiae, Paraburkholderia fungorum, Arthrobacter rhombi, Serratia liquefaciens, Paeniglutamicibacter gangotriensis, Brevibacterium aurantiacum, Acinetobacter lactucae, Pseudomonas sp., Brevibacterium sp., and Acinetobacter sp. Seventeen isolated strains showed varying degrees of inhibition by contact, while five species, including P. carnis, B. ferragutiae, S. liquefaciens, P. gangotriensis, and Brevibacterium sp., also inhibited Pd via non-contact mode. We utilized solid-phase microextraction coupled with GC-MS to obtain approximately 20 volatile compounds, all of which exhibited inhibitory effects on the growth of Pd, including ketones, aldehydes, and sulfur ethers. Notably, 5 ppm of 1-undecene, dimethyl trisulphide, and 2-nonanone each independently inhibited Pd growth. These findings suggest that the antagonistic strains and their VOCs might help protect bats from WNS. Understanding the interactions between Pd and skin flora, along with their VOCs, may be crucial in mitigating bats' vulnerability to WNS and developing effective mitigation strategies in the future.

AB  - Gut microbiome studies based on fecal samples can non-invasively reflect the survival and health status of endangered species. This study presents the first characterization of the gut microbiome in the semi-wild population of the critically endangered Saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica), unveiling the existence of two distinct enterotypes within the semi-wild Saiga: the Oscillospiraceae UCG-005 enterotype and the Arthrobacter enterotype. These enterotypes show significant differences in microbiome diversity, composition, and predicted functions. The Arthrobacter enterotype has lower alpha diversity, fewer short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, more potential pathogens, lower energy metabolism and higher lipid metabolism abundance. The findings imply that Saiga with the Arthrobacter enterotype have lower energy utilization efficiency and higher disease risks, particularly for obesity. Microbial correlation network analysis indicates SCFAsproducing bacteria play a key role in the formation of these enterotypes. This suggests that next-generation probiotics, primarily composed of SCFAs-producing bacteria, could be used to regulate and improve the health of the Saiga. Additionally, the similarity of the enterotype associated with a healthier survival state to that of wild counterparts suggests that incorporating gut microbiome monitoring into the key indicators for the reintroduction of endangered species could be significant for wildlife conservation and management.

AB  - The greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis) once occupied much of Australia's mainland. Bilbies are now listed as vulnerable and only occur in 20% of their former range. Operation Rangeland Restoration aims to to restore an ex-pastoral lease; reintroduce several species of locally extirpated fauna, including the bilby; and maintain the area in perpetuity for the conservation of Australian arid zone species. Bilbies were reintroduced to the Matuwa Indigenous Protected Area between 2007 and 2010 and, with ongoing landscape-scale control of feral predators, herbivores, and fire, have thrived. Here, we present a detailed account of the methods used during the reintroduction, showing that between 2007 and 2019 there has been an 88% increase in the area of occupancy by bilbies at Matuwa. The results of 2-ha track plot surveys conducted by the traditional owners of Matuwa suggest that the reintroduced bilbies are emigrating out of Matuwa. In addition, in 2018 and 2019 we used 120 camera-traps over 18 mo and occupancy analysis to confirm the widespread presence of bilbies across Matuwa and define significant habitat correlates. Bilbies were more likely to be detected on sandplains with Eucalyptus species as overstorey vegetation and Triodia as understorey vegetation. Bilbies were not detected in habitats with >= 75% bare ground. We attribute the success of the bilby reintroduction at Matuwa to the consistent implementation of landscape-scale control of feral predators. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - A chief tool in plant conservation is the augmenting or establishment of threatened plant populations by translocating individuals grown ex-situ. As translocations become an increasingly common practise in conser-vation and land management, various techniques to increase survival and persistence have become established as standard. Here we use a large historical database of plant translocations to evaluate the evidence for common management techniques to enhance translocation performance. We found that the most important factors associated with maximising size and survival of translocated plant populations were the number of propagules planted, fencing to protect from herbivores, and stimulating recruitment. Factors influencing the probability of recruitment were less certain, however burning and watering increased its likelihood. We also asked how habitat and lifeform influenced translocation performance. Translocations in grassland habitats performed worse than other habitats, and translocations of their predominant lifeform, the perennial grasses, also compared poorly. Our results make a strong case for the utility of a limited number of management interventions, and we highlight where a more explicit focus on experimental data might build our understanding of the factors influencing success in plant translocations.

AB  - Assessment of zooarchaeological data for the principal livestock (i.e., cattle, sheep, goats and pigs) reveals regional and cultural variability in how animals were manipulated, marketed, bred, and utilized over the course of antiquity. This paper focuses upon those developments, as reconstructed through zooarchaeological frequency and morphometric data for the period from c. 1000 BCE to c. 700 CE. Regionally, North Africa encompasses a vast territory, from Egypt, in the East, to Mauretania, in the West. Ecologically, there are variations within each of these zones. Culturally, moreover, these regions witnessed the introduction and influence of different social and economic agents and factors over the timeframe under investigation. This paper examines patterns in these components in a broad synthetic manner, using zooarchaeological data across the entire expanse of Roman North Africa-from Egypt to Mauretania. Focus centers upon the nature and degree of size and shape changes within the principal livestock, modifications that were in part influenced by aspects such as the scale and pattern in trade, dietary appeal for animal products (notably fatty meats), market demands, ecological adaptations, as well as economic and cultural contact among areas. Key similarities and differences in faunal patterns, across time and space within ancient North Africa, and the links these share with changes in animal husbandry schemes are outlined.

AB  - The notothenid Patagonotothen ramsayi is one of the most abundant fin fish species on the Patagonian Shelf and it is an important prey species and central to the trophic ecology of the shelf ecosystem of the region. 353 otoliths and the parasites analysed from 80 fishes collected in January 2010, and 2004 and 2006, respectively, from the Falkland Islands Shelf and in an area north of the Falkland Islands on the high seas, were used to gain insights into the stock discrimination using elemental signatures and parasitology. Multivariate analyses (Quadratic Discriminant Function Analysis (QDFA)) of trace elements in the edges of the otolith was extremely well resolved indicating samples taken from the southern (SS), northern Falkland Islands shelf (NS) and the high seas (HS) to the north are clearly separated. Analyses of the otoliths cores were less well resolved, but showed good separation. However, there was overlap with the samples taken on the SS / NS, NS / HS, but no overlap between the samples taken on the SS / HS, indicating some intermixing during larval dispersal. Univariate and multivariate analyses of parasite communities showed a clear separation of samples taken from the SS and HS. In addition, this study has added to the biogeography and knowledge of host specificity of the parasites inhabiting the Patagonian Shelf. Our results demonstrate that the multi-pronged approach of using both otolith trace elemental analyses and parasites can be a powerful tool to resolve stock discrimination in P. ramsayi.

AB  - Sensitivity analysis is often used to help understand and manage ecological systems by assessing how a constant change in vital rates or other model parameters might affect the management outcome. This allows the manager to identify the most favorable course of action. However, realistic changes are often localized in time-for example, a short period of culling leads to a temporary increase in the mortality rate over the period. Hence, knowing when to act may be just as important as knowing what to act on. In this article, we introduce the method of time-dependent sensitivity analysis (TDSA) that simultaneously addresses both questions. We illustrate TDSA using three case studies: transient dynamics in static disease transmission networks, disease dynamics in a reservoir species with seasonal life history events, and endogenously driven population cycles in herbivorous invertebrate forest pests. We demonstrate how TDSA often provides useful biological insights, which are understandable on hindsight but would not have been easily discovered without the help of TDSA. However, as a caution, we also show how TDSA can produce results that mainly reflect uncertain modeling choices and are therefore potentially misleading. We provide guidelines to help users maximize the utility of TDSA while avoiding pitfalls.

AB  - Plant traits, used by the invasive insect herbivores to find and select suitable hosts, can play an important role in insect host range expansion. With regard to invasive Lycorma delicatula, it is not well explored, however, how the plant origin affects insect host selection, and whether native and introduced host plants differ in their morphology, lifespan, as well as environmental requirements for growth. We addressed this issue in our study through the comprehensive assessment of 25 relevant plant traits (a total of 27,601 records retrieved from the TRY database), as well as the origin and phylogenetic relationships of 37 host plants of L. delicatula in the U.S. Our results showed that only leaf area, leaf chlorophyll content, and canopy size were significantly greater in the introduced hosts than that in native plants. We did not detect a significant effect of the plant origin on other characteristics. Additionally, no significant differences between native and introduced hosts of L. delicatula in genetic distances from introduced Ailanthus altissima (the most preferred host) were detected. These results, for the first time, suggest strong evidence for ecological fitting which might drive the host plant selection of L. delicatula and its rapid spread in the U.S.

AB  - Introduction: Small-scale sheep and goat farming is one of the business models the EU depends on to achieve the objectives of the Green Deal. However, these production systems are characterized by structural weaknesses that risk being aggravated by international events, such as the post-COVID-19 crisis and reconstruction, the conflict in the European area and the generalized inflationary wave. Against this scenario, the work aims to expand knowledge of these companies' sustainability levels to assess their performance, business model, the strategic keys to their resilience and chances of survival in the changed international scenario. Materials & Methods: The approach chosen is SAFA (Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems), the FAO's holistic framework. The empirical analysis focused on a sample of farms in a semi-arid Mediterranean area. Results: The results demonstrate the sustainability lag in governance, social capital, fertilizer management, landscape heritage and economic terms. This is due to the absence of strategic planning on soil, environmental and livestock management, genetic and human resource management, and farm structure. Regarding economic resilience on performance, the weight of the CAP (common agricultural policy) for these farms and the effect of high production costs are high. Conclusion: The work is helpful for different stakeholders, who are invited both to structure the intervention of eco-schemes on animal welfare for the 2023/2027 programming period and to support farm development plans to foster the flow of innovation, cooperation and sustainability.

AB  - The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) is the best-known hypothesis explaining high performance (e.g. rapid population growth) of exotic species. However, the current framing of the ERH does not explicitly link evidence of enemy release with exotic performance. This leads to uncertainty regarding the role of enemy release in biological invasions. Here, we demonstrate that the effect of enemy release on exotic performance is the product of three factors: enemy impact, enemy diversity, and host adaptation. These factors are modulated by seven contexts: time since introduction, resource availability, phylogenetic relatedness of exotic and native species, host-enemy asynchronicity, number of introduction events, type of enemy, and strength of growth-defence trade-offs. ERH-focused studies frequently test different factors under different contexts. This can lead to inconsistent findings, which typifies current evidence for the ERH. For example, over 80% of meta-analyses fail to consider ecological contexts which can alter study findings; we demonstrate this by re-analysing a recent ERH synthesis. Structuring the ERH around factors and contexts promotes generalisable predictions about when and where exotic species may benefit from enemy release, empowering effective management. Our mechanistic factor-context framework clearly lays out the evidence required to support the ERH, unifies many enemy-related invasion hypotheses, and enhances predictive capacity.
   The enemy release hypothesis as an explanation for (a) increased exotic performance is the product of (b) three factors, which are modulated by (c) seven contexts. Three factors: 1) the difference in per-capita effect of enemies (compare damage on leaves); 2) the difference in enemy diversity, which incorporates enemy abundance (number of individuals) and richness (number of species); and 3) host adaptation, which involves changes in exotic growth (plant size) and defence (shield size). Changes in any one factor will benefit the exotic, assuming the other factors are held constant (e.g. reductions in enemy impact will lead to release, even if enemy diversity remains unchanged). The influence of these factors and our ability to detect them changes with seven contexts. Each panel in (c) shows two hypothetical studies that examine different levels of a given context, and so would give contrasting support for the ERH. While context dependence is visualised in terms of two different exotic species, the contexts are equally applicable to a single exotic species arriving to different native communities, or different source populations of a single exotic species invading the same native community.

AB  - Predictions of animal movement are vital for understanding and managing wild populations. However, the fine-scale, complex decision-making of animals can pose challenges for the accurate prediction of trajectories. Integrated step selection functions (iSSFs), a common tool for inferring relationships between animal movement and the environment, are also increasingly used to simulate animal trajectories for prediction. Although admitting a lot of flexibility, the iSSF framework is limited to its reliance on pre-defined functional forms for fitting to data, and iSSFs that involve complex functional forms to model detailed processes can be prohibitively difficult to fit and interpret. Here, we present deepSSF, an approach to fit and predict animal movement data using deep learning. The deepSSF approach replaces the log-linear model of an iSSF with a neural network architecture that receives multiple environmental layers and scalar values as inputs and outputs a single layer representing the next-step probability. We demonstrate an example deepSSF model, built in PyTorch, consisting of distinct but interacting habitat selection and movement subnetworks. This allows for explicit representation of both selection and movement processes, thus giving interpretable intermediate outputs. We apply our model to GPS data of introduced water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) in the tropical savannas of Northern Australia. Our deepSSF model was able to learn features that are present in the habitat covariate layers, such as linear features (rivers, forest edges) and the composition of certain habitat areas, without having to specify them pre-emptively within the model framework. It was able to capture complex interactions between the habitat covariates as well as temporal dynamics across time of day and year. Finally, our deepSSF model generally had better in- and out-of-sample predictive accuracy than the analogous iSSF model. We expect that the deepSSF approach will generate accurate and informative predictions about animal movement, which can be used for deepening our understanding of animal-environment systems and for the practical management of species. We discuss how the wide range of existing deep learning tools could enable the deepSSF approach to be extended to represent memory and social dynamic processes, with the potential for integrating non-spatial data sources such as accelerometers and physiological sensors.

AB  - Herbivore digestion in aquatic ecosystems is usually considered a method of nutrient repackaging rather than recycling, as recalcitrant and low-level nutrients are presumed for their egesta. We hypothesize that this opinion holds only for nutrients recycled by excretion and egestion, not for those elements recycled overwhelmingly by fecal decomposition. In this study, we compared the dissolution of biogenic silica (BSi), phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) between two food items and fecal pellets of two marine invertebrates fed on artificial seawaters free of bacteria. Relative to raw food materials, the mass proportion in fecal pellets of BSi increased, while that of P and Fe decreased. During the 21 days of incubation, the total dissolution rate of BSi was 13.9-36.0 times higher in fecal pellets than food items, followed by P (1.5-4.2 times) and Fe (1.1-2.4 times). While the dissolution of BSi and Fe occurred mostly in the first few days, P was mostly released in the last ten days. Regarding BSi dissolution, a higher rate was observed in oyster Crassostrea gigas than the Echiuran Urechis unicinctus, but no significant difference was found between fecal pellets in either species under naturally available diatom food (Phaeodactylum tricornutum) and introduced terrestrial food (rice husk powder), respectively. Our results show direct evidence of digestion-associated nutrients mobilization. BSi dissolution after animal digestion may be similarly efficient to that caused by bacteria colonization in natural seawater.

AB  - Body size is an important functional trait to animals. Caste division of eusocial insects can exert a profound influence on their interactions with environment. We investigate the intra-specific variation of body size between caste within Odontotermes formosanus (Shiraki) (Blattodea: Termitidae), the most common and widely distributed termite species in Taiwan Island. By utilizing specimens from the NCHU Termite Collection and WorldClim data, we describe the body size distribution pattern of O. formosanus on two castes, worker and alate, and relationship with climatic factors is examined. The body size of workers is positively correlated with latitude and elevation. The body size of alates does not correlate with latitude but is positively correlated with elevation. Temperature factors negatively affect the body size of both castes. Precipitation has a positive effect on the body size of alates and no effect on workers. Additionally, humidity and temperature fluctuations over time have divergent effects on the body size of alates and workers. The results provide evidence of trait evolution decoupling at the intraspecific level, which may be shaped by climatic factors.

AB  - In insects, ecological competition has often resulted in phenotypic changes and modifications to foraging areas. In termites-and social insects as a whole-colonies cannot easily escape competition through the relocation of their colony. In these species, the outcomes of inter and intra-specific competition are influenced by different life history traits, such as colony size, breeding system (number and types of reproductives), food preference, tunneling patterns, nest site selection, and antagonism between colonies. Here, we investigated variation in breeding system and spatial distribution among colonies of a higher termite Amitermes parvulus and a subterranean termite Reticulitermes flavipes within an urban landscape. We first developed microsatellite markers as a tool to study these life history traits in A. parvulus. Second, we assessed competitive exclusion or tolerance of A. parvulus and R. flavipes colonies by determining their fine-scale distribution using monitoring stations on a grid site, and their large-scale distribution across an urban landscape. Third, we investigated the breeding system of A. parvulus colonies. We showed that the numerous colonies of R. flavipes inhabiting a restricted area contrast with the few, but spatially expansive colonies of A. parvulus, suggesting these species face different degrees of intra-specific competition. We showed that colonies of A. parvulus frequently merged together, and all of them were likely headed by inbred neotenic reproductives, two characteristics rarely observed in higher termites. Overall, our study revealed drastic differences in colony structure, breeding systems and foraging ranges between the two species. These differences may reflect differences in food preference and food availability between the two species allowing their co-existence within the same urban environment.

AB  - Native legumes are functionally important members of grasslands, but their reintroduction into degraded systems is limited by strong establishment filters. One of these establishment filters might be rhizobia limitation, where legume seedlings are unable to find suitable rhizobia symbionts in grasslands targeted for restoration. To test links between rhizobial inoculation and legume demographic parameters in a grassland restoration context, we evaluated how inoculation with rhizobia altered survival and seed production of a native annual legume (Chamaecrista fasciculata) inoculated with rhizobia and transplanted into a restored prairie. Small mammal herbivory was an important filter affecting survival of C. fasciculata transplants, with inoculated plants 81% more likely to be grazed than uninoculated plants. Despite this heavy grazing, plants inoculated with rhizobia survived transplantation 71% more often and, as a result, produced 82% more flowers, experienced 73% more visits by pollinators, and on average produced 220% more seeds. Our results indicate that although herbivory may also shape legume population establishment, at least in some years in some places, rhizobia could alter C. fasciculata interactions with both herbivores and pollinators and improve population establishment.

AB  - IntroductionAs anthropogenic change alters and fragments habitats, it is apparent that evolutionary change can co-occur with ecological change, though the scale and consequences of this contemporary evolution remain unclear. In coastal salt marshes of eastern North America, the flood tolerant low elevation marsh grass (Spartina alterniflora), is displacing Spartina patens, the flood intolerant high elevation marsh grass. Rising seas restrict S. patens, once occupying large areas of many hectares, to increasingly small patches, some as small as a few square meters. MethodsUsing nine microsatellite loci, we examined the genetic diversity and population structure of Tumidagena minuta, a minute, flightless planthopper and specialist herbivore of S. patens. We sampled T. minuta from S. patens habitat patches of varying radius (3-82 meters) and distances (54-1,100 meters) to test how landscape variation affects population genetic parameters associated with microevolutionary processes. We sampled and genotyped 142 T. minuta individuals across six S. patens patches in a single marsh in New Jersey, USA. ResultsWe observed high polymorphism, observing between 7 and 28 alleles per locus and an average of 13.3 alleles per locus. We observed no genetic differentiation among sampled patches (R-ST = -0.0109). The contemporary genetic effective population size (N-e) was estimated at approximately 360 (95% confidence interval: 208-1325) based on two-locus linkage disequilibrium. Based on an estimate of N(e)m = 32.4 in the finite island model, the estimated gene flow rate among these patches was 0.09 migrants per generation. DiscussionThese estimates, which are rarely produced for non-model insects, suggest that, despite rapid and precipitous decreases in habitat size and connectivity, T. minuta populations have remained large and have experienced little genetic differentiation due to drift. Ecological changes in patch size and isolation at this scale have not influenced population genetic processes like effective migration rate for T. minuta, consistent with our expectations for an insect with a large population size.

AB  - IntroductionRenewal is a behavioral phenomenon wherein extinction learning fails to generalize between different contextual environments, thereby representing a significant challenge to extinction-based rehabilitative therapies. Previously, we have shown that renewal of extinguished appetitive behavior differs across the estrous cycle of the female rat. In this experiment that effect is replicated and extended upon to understand how the estrous cycle may modulate contextual representation at the neuronal population level to drive renewal. MethodsEstrous cycle stage [i.e., proestrus (P, high hormone) or metestrus/diestrus (M/D, low hormone)] was considered during two important learning and behavioral expression windows: at extinction training and during long-term memory (LTM)/renewal testing. Cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity using fluorescence in situ hybridization (catFISH) for Arc mRNA was conducted after the distinct context-stimulus exposures. ResultsRats in P during context-dependent extinction training but in a different stage of the estrous cycle during LTM and renewal testing (P-different) were shown to exhibit more renewal of conditioned foodcup (but not conditioned orienting) behavior compared to rats in other estrous cycle groups. Importantly, we discovered this depends on the order of tests. P-different rats showed differential Arc mRNA expression in regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, and hippocampus (HPC). For each case P-different rats had more co-expression (i.e., expression of both nuclear and cytoplasmic) of Arc mRNA compared to other groups; specific to the dorsal HPC, P-different rats also had a more robust Arc mRNA response to the extinction context exposure. ConclusionThese data suggest female rats show estrous cycle state-dependent renewal of appetitive behavior, and differences in context and conditioned stimulus representation at the neuronal level may drive this effect.

AB  - Population-level shifts in reproductive phenology in response to environmental change are common, but whether individual-level responses are modified by demographic and genetic factors remains less well understood. We used mixed models to quantify how reproductive timing varied across 1772 female southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) breeding at Marion Island in the Southern Ocean (1989-2019), and to identify the factors that correlate with phenological shifts within and between individuals. We found strong support for covariation in the timing of breeding arrival dates and the timing of the preceding moult. Breeding arrival dates were more repeatable at the individual level, as compared with the population level, even after accounting for individual traits (wean date as a pup, age and breeding experience) associated with phenological variability. Mother-daughter similarities in breeding phenology were also evident, indicating that additive genetic effects may contribute to between-individual variation in breeding phenology. Over 30 years, elephant seal phenology did not change towards earlier or later dates, and we found no correlation between annual fluctuations in phenology and indices of environmental variation. Our results show how maternal genetic (or non-genetic) effects, individual traits and linkages between cyclical life-history events can drive within- and between-individual variation in reproductive phenology.

AB  - The efficacy of translocation as a method for conserving species in peril has not been fully evaluated. Post-release monitoring rarely involves long-term assessments and initial success metrics may not translate to population viability. In particular, genetic factors may play a critical role in fitness following release as founder effect, genetic drift, inbreeding depression and outbreeding depression can influence extinction risk. As part of a multi-year recovery effort, we translocated populations of the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat (Dipodomys stephensi; SKR), in order to restore population connectivity. Here we evaluate the success of the translocation efforts through long-term population estimation and genetic analyses. We conducted post-release assessments for 9 years, and used Bayesian clustering analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) of 24 microsatellite markers developed for this species to assess genetic admixture between source and translocated populations. Demographic results indicate long-term translocation success, as evidenced by founder survival and establishment, and population growth and regulation. Genetic results show admixture at the release site between genetically discrete source populations, provide definitive evidence that translocated individuals, not immigrants, produced offspring at the release site, that these offspring successfully reproduced and that even with moderate to great genetic differentiation of source populations, outbreeding depression was not detected. Despite the historical failure of heteromyid translocation efforts, our long-term study illustrates how the development of species-specific best practices led to an effective strategy for SKR recovery. More broadly, our results suggest efforts that use a systematic hypothesis-testing framework alongside long-term monitoring offer great promise in improving translocation outcomes.

AB  - AimMany species have suffered anthropogenic range contraction and no longer occupy all available suitable environmental conditions. This is particularly problematic for the construction of habitat suitability models (HSMs), which assume that a species' contemporary range reflects its full species-environment relationship. HSMs therefore risk underestimating suitable environment areas, and misinforming conservation decisions. Incorporating historic (centuries-old) records partly reduces this bias, but even these records are also subject to human disturbance. We incorporated fossil records of the critically endangered saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica, L., 1776), alongside historic and current records, into current and future habitat suitability models. Saiga has experienced drastic range contraction and may have a truncated species-environment relationship. The results allowed us to test whether its current habitat provides optimal environmental conditions, or whether saiga should be considered a refugee species.LocationNorthern Hemisphere.TaxonSaiga tatarica (Bovidae, Artiodactyla).MethodsWe collated historic and fossil saiga occurrence records from published literature, museum archives and global databases. Modern occurrence records were obtained from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List assessment. Four bioclimatic variables were downloaded from . HSMs were generated through Maxent, using the maxnet package in R. Three HSMs were developed: present only, present historic and present fossil. Each of these models was projected onto current and two future (2070) climate change scenarios.ResultsSaiga fossil records increased the predicted suitable environment area by 783% and 1416% for current and future climate projections respectively. Our results suggest the saiga is not a refugee species but occupies only a portion of its potential environmental niche. The saiga's contemporary range is predicted environmentally suitable throughout all models and projections, and therefore in situ conservation management is recommended.Main ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of incorporating fossil records into HSMs to better understand species-environment relationships and develop more robust conservation strategies for appropriate endangered species.

AB  - The current radioecological situation of the territory in Bryansk oblast that was polluted as a result of the Chernobyl accident is analyzed based on calculating the radiation dose rate for reference organisms of the terrestrial biota. The initial data for the assessment were observation data (May-December in 1986-2020) on the density of soil contamination in the areas of Bryansk oblast located within different zones of radioactive contamination. Elk (Alces alces), the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), and the earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris) were selected as reference organisms of the terrestrial biota. The total radiation dose rate for the biota objects was determined in accordance with the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and Roshydromet R 52.18.820-2015. Cs-137 was considered as the main dose-forming radionuclide. The contribution of Sr-90 to the radiation dose rate was insignificant (0.1-4.9%). Analysis of the radiation safety of biota objects consisted in checking the condition that the integral indicator of soil pollution (IISP) in the areas of Bryansk oblast did not exceed the environmentally safe level. According to the current monitoring data on the state of the territory of the Chernobyl radioactive trace, the IISP is significantly lower than the environmentally safe level for all areas of this region except for the exclusion zones. The maximum radiation doses were recorded for elk living in the vicinity of the village of Zaborye, Krasnogorsk raion, in 2020. According to a conservative estimate, a high dose load on biota exceeding the safe radiation level (SRL) for elk and the bank vole was observed in 1986 in Novozybkovsk raion. The dose rate for vertebrate animals in the contaminated areas of the region is one order of magnitude lower than the safe radiation level. In the future, it is recommended to continue radioecological studies of the territories and monitoring of the radiation situation in the most polluted areas of Bryansk oblast. It is also necessary to organize a radioecological reserve in the exclusion zones to carry out regular observations and improve the system of radiation protection of the environment.

AB  - Introduction: Ecosystem restoration facilitates ecological succession. When a coral reef experiences a distur-bance, the community of sessile benthic organisms can follow a successional trajectory that favors the domi-nance of coral or a change of state to an ecosystem dominated by algae. Objective: To better understand the impact of coral transplants on succession of the sessile benthic community. Methods: To measure and monitor the coral cover (cm2) of Pocillopora spp., and the composition of the associ-ated benthic community, experimental and control coral reef patches were established at the coral restoration site in Golfo Dulce, South Pacific Costa Rica. Thirty Pocillopora spp. colonies were attached to nails on the substrate in an experimental patch. The control coral patch contained nails with non-transplanted colonies. Both treatments were photographed monthly during a period of eight months. Changes in the coverage of coral and other sessile benthic organisms were measured from the images and compared over time between the experi-mental and control patches. Results: The coral transplants experienced bleaching events in August through September 2019 and January through February 2020. The first bleaching event possibly due to sedimentation, and the second to high tem-peratures. By the end of the experiment, 83 % of the colonies had survived. The live colonies grew significantly following transplantation; > 67 % of their initial coverage area after eight months. In the experimental patch, the areas of Pocillopora spp., coralline crustose algae (CCA), and cyanobacteria increased while the area of algal turf decreased. The increase in coral coverage and CCA, and decrease in algal turf in the experimental patch could be due to herbivores attracted to transplants. The increase in cyanobacteria in the experimental patch could be the result of higher temperatures and may have been a factor in the death of colonies. Conclusions: The transplantation of Pocillopora spp. colonies in Golfo Dulce changed the early successional trajectory of the sessile benthic community to favor the dominance of coral dominance in the experimental patch. These results may be useful in informing expectations for future restoration efforts.

AB  - This study provides new species records (NRs) of macroalgal assemblages present in rocky habitats from the South Shetland Islands (SSI) and north-eastern Antarctic Peninsula (EAP), Weddell Sea. Surveys were conducted during the summers of 2013/2014 to 2017/2018 at Elephant, Deception, Half Moon and Vega islands. Data from the present study and those available in the literature from the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) were combined to provide an updated checklist, giving insights into macroecology and potential changes in thermohaline circulation patterns. A total of 48 macroalgal taxa were identified from our sampling, with eight representing NRs to the EAP sector of the Weddell Sea and five representing NRs to the SSI. Statistical differences among the assemblages from the SSI, WAP and EAP were identified. NRs, including opportunistic species and new information about the biogeographical distributions of species reported here, give insights into ecoregional connectivity and environmental changes. This study updates macroalgal diversity records in regions that are currently experiencing the impacts of climate change. Future and ongoing monitoring for conservation purposes is required to detect non-native species, new dispersal pathways and patterns related to thermohaline anomalies in Antarctic waters.

AB  - Introduction The renewal effect of extinction describes the reoccurrence of an extinguished response if recall is performed in a context that is not the same as the extinction context. This learning phenomenon is clinically relevant, since it potentially interferes with therapy success for anxiety disorders or phobias. The propensity to show the renewal effect appears to be a stable processing strategy in context-related extinction, associated with higher BOLD activation in hippocampus, ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in individuals who show renewal (REN) compared to those who do not (NoREN). However, evidence on a potential relationship between structural properties such as gray matter volume (GMV) in these regions and the propensity to show renewal is lacking.Methods In this study, we applied voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to investigate whether individuals with and without a propensity for renewal differ regarding their GMV in extinction-related brain regions, and whether such a difference is linked to the renewal level.Results Results revealed differential GMV in REN and NoREN in adjacent subregions of IFG and vmPFC, respectively. Higher GMV in REN was located predominantly in orbital IFG and in BA10 of vmPFC. Higher GMV in NoREN was located predominantly in triangular IFG and in BA 11 of vmPFC. In bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior hippocampus, GMV was overall higher in NoREN. In the complete sample, higher GMV in IFG BA 47, vmPFC BA11, bilateral ACC and bilateral anterior hippocampus was associated with less renewal, and partially with a higher error level in extinction learning in a novel context.Discussion The findings suggest that higher GMV in several regions active during extinction learning may support a more thorough processing of extinction trials which in turn could be conducive to an extinction recall solely based on recent extinction memory, disregarding context information. In summary, this study provides first-time evidence for a relationship of GMV in of extinction- and renewal-relevant brain regions with behavioral performance during extinction learning and the propensity to show the renewal effect.

AB  - The domestication and subsequent development of sheep are crucial events in the history of human civilization and the agricultural revolution. However, the impact of interspecific introgression on the genomic regions under domestication and subsequent selection remains unclear. Here, we analyze the whole genomes of domestic sheep and their wild relative species. We found introgression from wild sheep such as the snow sheep and its American relatives (bighorn and thinhorn sheep) into urial, Asiatic and European mouflons. We observed independent events of adaptive introgression from wild sheep into the Asiatic and European mouflons, as well as shared introgressed regions from both snow sheep and argali into Asiatic mouflon before or during the domestication process. We revealed European mouflons might arise through hybridization events between a now extinct sheep in Europe and feral domesticated sheep around 6000-5000 years BP. We also unveiled later introgressions from wild sheep to their sympatric domestic sheep after domestication. Several of the introgression events contain loci with candidate domestication genes (e.g., PAPPA2, NR6A1, SH3GL3, RFX3 and CAMK4), associated with morphological, immune, reproduction or production traits (wool/meat/milk). We also detected introgression events that introduced genes related to nervous response (NEURL1), neurogenesis (PRUNE2), hearing ability (USH2A), and placental viability (PAG11 and PAG3) into domestic sheep and their ancestral wild species from other wild species.
   Chen, Xu, et al. performed a population genetics analysis of the eight species in the Ovis genus to assess the evolutionary and demographic history of these wild species and its domesticated counterpart. The authors identified a number of introgression events at different time periods, likely associated with the domestication process as well as identify a number of possible genomic targets of domestication.

AB  - The fallow deer (Dama dama) represents a typical example of a species in the early stage of domestication, where selection for tameness is not yet complete. In contrast to fully domesticated species, there is still a lack of studies on the behaviour of deer under farm conditions and their response to changes in their environment. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the behaviour of fallow deer after the introduction of the novel object (NO) into the enclosure. The herd was observed at the most frequently visited part of the enclosure, i.e. the foraging area near the feeding station. We installed several different Non-animal NOs (abstract object/installation, camping chair, colourful boxes) and Animal NO (animal-shaped toy) with intervening Controls (periods without NO). Results generally showed that time spent at the foraging area decreased in the presence of NO (p < 0.05). This effect was significantly stronger when NO had an animal shape (horse-shaped toy), with the frequency of animal appearance also being lower with frequent complete absence of animals at the foraging area. However, diurnal rhythm of animal appearance did not differ, nor did group size. When looking at the ratio among different behaviours that animals performed in the foraging area (movement, stationary, feeding), we found no differences between the Control and Non-animal NO (feeding 42-43 %, stationary 38-39 %). However, in the presence of Animal NO, feeding behaviours increased significantly (57 %), while the stationary behaviours decreased significantly (24 %). While resting predominated among stationary behaviours in the Control and Non-animal NO treatments (72-75 %), vigilance represented the most stationary behaviours in the presence of Animal NO (58 %). Movement was consistently performed to the same extent (18-20 %). Therefore, the presence of the novel object reduced foraging activity and increased vigilance in fallow deer, and deer breeders should consider this. Avoidance of the foraging area within the enclosure, where animals have fewer alternative food sources, can be particularly problematic. Therefore, preventing or disturbing their regular foraging routine should be minimized to meet basic welfare requirements.

AB  - Selecting appropriate candidates for genetic rescue mostly relies on previous genetic research and monitoring, while ecological and behavioural traits of the remnant and source populations are rarely considered for such conservation measures. Because of their slow recovery, Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx populations in Central and Western Europe have been a repeated target of genetic reinforcements and reintroductions in the past 50 years. Once inhabiting much of south-eastern Europe, the Balkan lynx L. l. balcanicus is now critically endangered and confined to a small population. Long-term isolation has caused loss of genetic diversity and has possibly led to inbreeding depression. Immediate actions need to consider genetic reinforcement to increase the genetic diversity and secure population viability. Here, we compared the Balkan lynx with two neighbouring populations: Dinaric population originating from the Carpathian subspecies (L.l. carpathicus) and Anatolian population of Caucasian subspecies (L.l. dinniki) to determine is better suited source from an ecological standpoint. Main findings suggest that the L.l. carpathicus is ecologically more similar to the L.l. balcanicus and therefore likely better suited for the environment of south-western Balkans on the basis of prey preference (roe deer being the main prey), local prey availability (lower lagomorph and higher ungulate availability) and habitat use (predominant use of the mixed and broadleaved forests). We discuss the contrasting results of genetic and ecological analyses from both the evolutionary and conservation perspective and provide potential solutions that would take into account both aspects to pave the road towards potential genetic rescue of the Balkan lynx.

AB  - Simple Summary African swine fever (ASF) has been present in Poland since 2014. The article describes and explains the changes in the ASF epidemic in the wild boar population in the period 2014-2020. In that relatively short time, the disease has spread to about half of the territory of Poland, affecting eastern and western provinces. Most ASF-positive animals were molecular/virus-positive, however, the observation of the increase of serologically positive animals (potential survivors) in successive years of the epidemic, especially in areas where the virus has been present for a longer time, may indicate the potential beginning of ASF endemicity in Poland. African swine fever (ASF) is a lethal hemorrhagic disease of Suidae, i.e., domestic pigs and wild boars. The disease was introduced to Poland in 2014 and is now present in the wild boar population. Appropriate ASF prevention requires further research for answers to fundamental questions about the importance of vectors in virus transmission, the impact of environmental factors on the presence of ASFV in wild boar habitats, and the role of survivors as potential virus carriers and their part in the potential endemicity of ASF. In order to analyze the changes in the molecular and serological prevalence of ASFV in wild boar population in Poland, real-time PCR and ELISA/IPT tests were conducted. In the analyzed period (2014-2020), most of the ASF-positive wild boars were molecular/virus-positive, however, over the years the percentage and the number of seropositive animals has increased. At the beginning of the epidemic, the disease was limited to a small area of the country. Since then, it has spread to new provinces of Poland. From the beginning and until today, most notifications of ASF-positive wild boars were for carcasses (passive surveillance), however, the number of serologically positive animals is still increasing. Despite the fact that notifications of ASF outbreaks are still being received near the eastern border of Poland, the old ASF area seems to be limited mainly to ASF serologically positive animals, which may indicate the beginning of ASF endemicity in Poland.

AB  - Simple Summary: Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) causes a highly devastating disease, peste des petits ruminants (PPR), in sheep and goats, which is targeted for global control and eradication. However, in many developing countries, access to expensive sequencing technologies is limited and is compounded by difficulties in transporting clinical samples across international borders. Oxford nanopore MinION is a relatively cheap sequencing technology using portable devices that require minimal supporting laboratory infrastructure or technical expertise for sample preparation and rapid sequencing. In this study, Oxford nanopore MinION sequencing was carried out to generate complete genomes of PPRV from archived PPRV-positive samples collected from PPR outbreaks in goats in Ngorongoro and Momba districts in Tanzania during 2016 and 2018, respectively. Complete genomes of PPRV of 15,948 nucleotides long were generated within four hours of sequencing. The phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes revealed a high nucleotide identity (96.19-99.24%) with lineage III PPR viruses currently circulating in East Africa, indicating a common origin. The Oxford nanopore MinION sequencer can be deployed to overcome diagnostic and surveillance challenges in developing countries in the PPR Global Control and Eradication program. However, the coverage depth was uneven across the genome and amplicon dropout was observed between the matrix (M) and fusion (F) genes. Thus, larger field studies are needed to allow the collection of sufficient data to assess the robustness of nanopore sequencing technology.
   Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) causes a highly devastating disease of sheep and goats that threatens food security, small ruminant production and susceptible endangered wild ruminants. With policy directed towards achieving global PPR eradication, the establishment of cost-effective genomic surveillance tools is critical where PPR is endemic. Genomic data can provide sufficient in-depth information to identify the pockets of endemicity responsible for PPRV persistence and viral evolution, and direct an appropriate vaccination response. Yet, access to the required sequencing technology is low in resource-limited settings and is compounded by the difficulty of transporting clinical samples from wildlife across international borders due to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora, and Nagoya Protocol regulations. Oxford nanopore MinION sequencing technology has recently demonstrated an extraordinary performance in the sequencing of PPRV due to its rapidity, utility in endemic countries and comparatively low cost per sample when compared to other whole-genome (WGS) sequencing platforms. In the present study, Oxford nanopore MinION sequencing was utilised to generate complete genomes of PPRV isolates collected from infected goats in Ngorongoro and Momba districts in the northern and southern highlands of Tanzania during 2016 and 2018, respectively. The tiling multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out with twenty-five pairs of long-read primers. The resulting PCR amplicons were used for nanopore library preparation and sequencing. The analysis of output data was complete genomes of PPRV, produced within four hours of sequencing (accession numbers: MW960272 and MZ322753). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes revealed a high nucleotide identity, between 96.19 and 99.24% with lineage III PPRV currently circulating in East Africa, indicating a common origin.

AB  - Although fisheries bycatch is the greatest threat to many migratory marine megafauna, it remains unclear how population exposure to bycatch varies across the global range of threatened species. Such assessments across multiple populations are crucial for understanding variation in impacts and for identifying the management bodies responsible for reducing bycatch. Here, we combine extensive biologging data from white-chinned petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis) populations (representing >98% of their global breeding population) with pelagic and demersal longline and trawl fishing effort to map the global distribution and fisheries-overlap hotspots for the most bycaught seabird in the Southern Hemisphere. We tracked the year-round movements of 132 adults in 2006-2018 and examined spatial overlap among seven populations comprising three genetically distinct groupings (metapopulations). Foraging areas during the nonbreeding season were more concentrated than during breeding, with birds from all populations migrating to continental shelf or upwelling zones, but with low spatial overlap among metapopulations. Fisheries overlap differed more among than within metapopulations, underlining that these should be considered separate management units. Overlap with pelagic longline fisheries was greatest for Indian Ocean populations, and from the fleets of South Africa, Japan, Taiwan, and Spain, off southern Africa and in the High Seas. Overlap with demersal longline and trawl fisheries was greatest for Indian and Atlantic Ocean populations, within the Exclusive Economic Zones of South Africa, Namibia, and Argentina, and with the South Korean demersal longline fleet in the High Seas. The high overlap with South Korean longliners in the southwest Atlantic Ocean is of particular concern as demersal fishing in this region is not covered by any Regional Fisheries Management Organization (RFMO). We also identified fisheries-overlap hotspots within RFMOs where there are no seabird-bycatch mitigation requirements (1.5%-53.1% of total overlap within the area of competence of each RFMO), or where current mitigation regulations need to be strengthened. Our recommendations are that management bodies target the high-priority fisheries we have identified for improved bycatch monitoring, mandatory best-practice bycatch mitigation, and close monitoring of compliance, given the conservation concerns for white-chinned petrels and other threatened seabirds.

AB  - Economic value from protected areas informs decisions for biodiversity conservation and visitor benefits. Calculating these benefits assists governments to allocate limited budget resources. This study estimated tourism ecosystem service expenditure values for a regional protected area network in South Australia (57 parks) using direct transactional data, travel costs and economic multipliers. The big dataset came from a comprehensive booking system, which helped overcome common limitations associated with survey data (e.g., key areas rather than full network and high zero-value observations). Protected areas returned AU$373.8 million in the 2018-19 base year to the South Australian economy. The results indicate that combined estimation methods coupled to big data sets provide information on baseline expenditure to engage with critical conservation and tourism sites (e.g., Kangaroo Island). In this case they offer a unique full area network expenditure estimate which is an improvement on typical survey approaches, highlighting the advantage of protected area managers investing in big data. Finally, as South Australian protected areas exceed that in many other contexts the study offers important inputs to funding narratives and protected area expansion in line with global assessment targets.

AB  - Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae is a primary causative agent responsible for initiating polymicrobial pneumonia in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). Infections of bighorn sheep populations are typically characterized by initial all-age epizootics followed by long-term periods of repressed juvenile (lamb) survival. Populations of bighorn sheep in New Mexico, USA, were thought to be free of this pathogen prior to 2017 but recent infection of multiple herds raised concerns regarding impacts on population size and juvenile:female ratios. Using aerial survey, survival, and disease sampling data in an exploratory framework, we (1) characterize age-related differences in M. ovipneumoniae prevalence and seroprevalence, (2) quantify differences in lamb:ewe ratios pre- and post-M. ovipneumoniae detection, and (3) investigate differences in survival between previously exposed and na & iuml;ve individuals. From 2007 to 2022, we sampled 466 bighorn sheep across 19 populations in New Mexico for M. ovipneumoniae exposure. While the timing of initial herd infections varied across populations, one population sustained active infections for over 15 years. We found reduced juvenile:female ratios post M. ovipneumoniae exposure for both desert (O. c. mexicana) and Rocky Mountain (O. c. canadensis) bighorn sheep populations. Post-exposure ratio declines ranged from 20% to 69%. Evaluation of population size and environmental condition effects on juvenile:female ratios indicated varying impacts for each subspecies. Notably, population size was negatively related to Rocky Mountain juvenile:female ratios only after populations were exposed to M. ovipneumoniae. Additionally, climatic conditions in the previous lambing season and pre-parturition time frame were associated with juvenile:female ratios for Rocky Mountain populations, while juvenile:female ratios of desert bighorn appeared to only be affected by pre-parturition climatic conditions. Kaplan-Meier survival estimation of previously exposed, but putatively recovered, individuals (n = 31) and na & iuml;ve individuals (n = 70) revealed lower (75%; 95% CI: 62%-93%) but not statistically significant (p = 0.2) 1-year survival rates for individuals that were seropositive but not actively infected, when compared to seronegative individuals (88%; 95% CI: 81%-97%). These results collectively suggest that following M. ovipneumoniae introduction, bighorn sheep populations in New Mexico could be limited by lamb survival.

AB  - Trichophyton mentagrophytes is a zoophilic dermatophyte that can cause dermatophytosis in humans and animals. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered as a promising agent to overcome the drug-resistance of T. mentagrophytes. Our findings suggest that cationic antimicrobial peptide (ACP5) not only possesses stronger activity against T. mentagrophytes than fluconazole, but also shows lower toxicity to L929 mouse fibroblast cells than terbinafine. Notably, its resistance development rate after resistance induction was lower than terbinafine. The present study aimed to evaluate the fungicidal mechanism of ACP5 in vitro and its potential to treat dermatophyte infections in vivo. ACP5 at 1 xMIC completely inhibited T. mentagrophytes spore germination in vitro. ACP5 severely disrupts the mycelial morphology, leading to mycelial rupture. Mechanistically, ACP5 induces excessive ROS production, damaging the integrity of the cell membrane and decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential, causing irreversible damage in T. mentagrophytes. Furthermore, 1% ACP5 showed similar efficacy to the commercially available drug 1% terbinafine in a guinea pig dermatophytosis model, and the complete eradication of T. mentagrophytes from the skin by ACP5 was verified by tissue section observation. These results indicate that ACP5 is a promising candidate for the development of new agent to combat dermatophyte resistance.

AB  - Sea level rise contributions from the Pine Island Glacier (PIG) are strongly modulated by the backstress that its floating extension - Pine Island Ice Shelf (PIIS) - exerts on the adjoining grounded ice. The front of PIIS has recently retreated significantly via calving, and satellite and theoretical analyses have suggested further retreat is inevitable. As well as inducing an instantaneous increase in ice flow, retreat of the PIIS front may result in increased ocean melting, by relaxing the topographic barrier to warm ocean water that is currently provided by a prominent seabed ridge. Recently published research (Bradley and others, 2022a) has shown that PIIS may exhibit a strong melting response to calving, with melting close to the PIG grounding line always increasing with ice front retreat. Here, we summarise this research and, additionally, place the results in a glaciological context by comparing the impact of melt-induced and ice-dynamical changes in the ice shelf thinning rate. We find that while PIG is expected to experience rapid acceleration in response to further ice front retreat, the mean instantaneous thinning response is set primarily by changes in melting, rather than ice dynamics. Overall, further ice front retreat is expected to lead to enhanced ice-shelf thinning, with potentially detrimental consequences for ice shelf stability.

AB  - Alpha(2) receptor agonists (alpha(2)-agonists) are useful sedative and analgesic agents in sheep, but have adverse pulmonary effects, which are reportedly similar between different alpha(2)-agonists. This randomized crossover study compared pulmonary function after intravenous administration of an alpha(2)-agonist, either xylazine or an equipotent dose of medetomidine in 34 female sheep anaesthetized twice. Pulmonary function was assessed using spirometry, volumetric capnography, arterial blood gas analysis 1 min prior to, and 5 and 10 min after administration of the allocated alpha 2 agonist drug. Pulmonary structural changes were subsequently assessed using computed tomography (CT). Tachypnoea or hypoxaemia prompted reversal with atipamezole and exclusion of data. Data were analysed for a fixed effect of drug using a mixed effect linear model with significance set at p < 0.05. Ten sheep administered xylazine required atipamezole while none of sheep receiving medetomidine did. Xylazine produced significantly higher respiratory frequency, airway pressures, airway resistance and arterial carbon dioxide (CO2), and lower dynamic compliance, tidal volume, CO2 elimination and end tidal CO2 tension and arterial oxygen tension than medetomidine. This was associated with a significantly lower % of aerated tissue and higher % poorly and non-aerated tissue in CT images of sheep receiving xylazine versus medetomidine. In conclusion, xylazine administration produced marked decreases in pulmonary function, in ventilated isoflurane anaesthetized sheep, when compared to an equipotent dose of medetomidine when administered as an intravenous bolus supporting the use of medetomidine when alpha(2)-agonists are required.

AB  - Spearfishing, a common activity among Pacific Islanders, has been described to strongly modify the behaviour of target fish species. Rapa Nui (Easter Island), a remote Chilean oceanic island, has suffered a serious decline in its nearshore fish stocks through overfishing. In this study, the flight initiation distance (FID) of the Pacific rudderfish Kyphosus sandwicensis was measured at depths normally accessed by free divers and at deeper depths around Rapa Nui and the no-take Motu Motiro Hiva Marine Park (MMHMP). The overall FID at MMHMP was significantly shorter compared with that recorded in shallow waters at Rapa Nui, but did not differ from the FIDs recorded in deeper waters at Rapa Nui. The biomass of K. sandwicensis did not differ among study sites, but was significantly higher at deeper depths, supporting the hypothesis of depth refuge from fishing at Rapa Nui. Based on these findings, spatial and technical management strategies are proposed to help conserve the nearshore fish populations, such as the establishment of no-take zones and the enhancement of regulatory frameworks for coastal fisheries.

AB  - Simple Summary The genetic characterization of native sheep breeds from the Tunisian-Italian Mediterranean corridor, the earliest westward introduction route of sheep breeding from the domestication center, was carried out using microsatellite markers in order to compare the genetic diversity level between both Mediterranean sides' local sheep breeds, and to investigate their level of risk for conservation purposes. Sampling concerned both private and public/institutional farms of all the native Tunisian breeds in the case of the southern Mediterranean side, and one center Italian and the Venetian native breeds from the northern side. The results revealed that the genetic diversity level of the Tunisian native breeds was higher than that of the Italian ones, with a lower inbreeding level. The comparison between private and public farms in terms of genetic diversity, consanguinity, and conservation decisions highlighted the superiority of the public/institutional breeding management strategies over private ones in both Tunisian and Italian cases. The present study illustrated the efficiency of genomic characterization in making genetic diversity evaluations and preservation decisions of native and well-adapted sheep breeds in both developing and developed countries' rearing conditions. Non-commercialized sheep breeds known as local or native breeds are well adapted to their environmental constraints and constitute precious genetic resources that need prioritization for genetic diversity characterization and preservation. The aim of the present study was to assess the genetic diversity level and the related preservation decisions of very old and traditional native Mediterranean sheep breeds from Tunisia and Italy using 17 microsatellite markers. In total, 975 sheep were sampled from five Tunisian, one Center Italian, and four Venetian native breeds. Both private and publicly available farms were considered for each breed for breeding strategies' comparison purposes. The microsatellite set used was highly informative (PIC = 0.80 +/- 0.08), with a total of 383 alleles. Moderate genetic differentiation was revealed between the native sheep of the two Mediterranean sides (global overall loci F-ST = 0.081). The genetic diversity level was higher in the case of the Tunisian native breeds compared to the Italian ones, as evidenced by higher mean allelic richness, higher expected and observed heterozygosities, and lower inbreeding levels. Priority for conservation suggestions was carried out for each private or public breed population based on the contribution of each population to the diversity of the whole data. The four Venetian breeds, already undergoing conservation, the Tunisian dairy breed, and the very ancient Maghrebian breed, would be favored for conservation. In conclusion, our results highlighted the importance of the analyzed Mediterranean native sheep breeds as valuable inherited genetic reservoirs and supported previous conservation decisions made for the threatened breeds.

AB  - Introduction: During the early stage of pregnancy trophoblast cells adapt to adverse uterine environments characterized by oxygen and nutrient deprivation. Autophagy is an intracellular degradation process that aims to promote cell survival in response to stressful conditions. Autophagy activation passes through the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), also known as a placental nutrient sensor. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ovine trophoblast cells may adapt to a suboptimal environment through an mTOR dependent regulation of cell survival with relevant implications for key placental functionality. Methods: Primary ovine trophoblast cells subjected to mTOR inhibitor and low-nutrient conditions were used to explore how autophagy affects cellular functionality and expression of solute carriers' genes (SLCs). Results: Autophagy activation was confirmed both in rapamycin-treated and low-nutrient conditions, through the detection of specific autophagic markers. However, p-mTOR activation seems to be severely modified only following rapamycin treatment whereas 24h of starvation allowed p-mTOR reactivation. Starvation promoted migration compared to normal culture conditions whereas all trophoblast functional activities were decreased in rapamycin treatment. Interestingly in both conditions, the autophagy-activated environment did not affect the progesterone release. mRNA expression of amino acid transporters remains largely undisturbed except for SLC43A2 and SLC38A4 which are downregulated in starved and rapamycin-treated cells, respectively. Discussion: The study demonstrates that sheep trophoblast cells can adapt to adverse conditions in the early stage of placentation by balancing, in an mTOR dependent manner, nutrient recycling and transport with relevant effects for in vitro functional properties, which could potentially impact conceptus development and survival.

AB  - Simple Summary: Alternatives to surgical castration are an important issue in pig production due to societal concerns regarding animal welfare. Castration of piglets is a common practice to avoid boar taint, an unpleasant taste (urine/fecal like) of meat from uncastrated male pigs. In view of abandoning surgical castration and introduction of new alternatives, such as raising entire male pigs and applying immunocastration, several new issues are emerging. These include boar taint occurrence in case of entire male pigs and a deteriorated raw material (meat, fat) quality, which can affect consumer perception. Therefore, more information is needed about the consumer acceptance of products from the different alternatives. In the present study, two types of dry-cured meat products were assessed to give some insights into the sensory characteristic and consumers' liking of the products coming from immunocastrated, entire male and surgically castrated animals.<br></p>
   <br></p>
   Consumer studies on acceptability of pork from immunocastrates (IC) and entire males (EM) are of primary importance, if these alternatives are to replace surgical castration (SC) of piglets. Data on the sensory traits and consumers acceptance of IC and EM meat products are still limited. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to (1) describe the sensory profile by quantitative descriptive analysis and (2) test the perception and consumer liking of salami (dry-fermented sausage) and pancetta (dry-cured belly) from EM, IC and SC animals. The consumer tests included the scaling method and check-all-that-apply. Profiling showed that EM products were scored lower in the overall sensory quality compared to IC or SC. EM products differed mainly from IC and SC in the intensity of the manure, sweat odor and flavor, persistent impression and texture (hardness, gumminess and easy to fragment). Salami samples did not differ in liking. In pancetta, the differences were significant for odor liking and visual quality (expected liking). Consumers did not perceive EM products as inferior in terms of liking, while sensory profiling indicated differences for boar taint presence and texture. Using meat originating from IC did not result in any differences in consumers acceptance as compared to products from SC.</p>

AB  - The Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH) predicts that the escape from natural enemies, such as specialist herbivores, may explain the invasiveness of some invasive alien plants, maximizing their investment in growth and reproduction. This release from natural enemies might decrease the investment in expensive defense mechanisms (i.e., digestibility reducers) against the attack of specialist enemies, whilst increasing the investment in defenses (i.e., cheap toxins) and tolerance against the attack of generalist herbivores, as exposed by the Shifting Defense Hypothesis (SDH). To test this, we conducted a greenhouse experiment to compare morphological and physiological traits of Carpobrotus edulis, collected in its native (South Africa) and introduced (Chile and Spain) ranges, attacked by the generalist spittlebug Philaenus spumarius and the specialist scale insect Pulvinariella mesembryanthemi. Our results do not support the ER and SD hypotheses. We found that C. edulis plants collected from native and introduced ranges showed no significant differences in growth and defensive compounds studied for both controls and those plants under attack by the generalist P. spumarius (i.e., showing no increase in biomass or changes in biochemical defenses). In contrast, the specialist herbivore P. mesembryanthemi induced the production of total phenols and tannins and reduced the growth and survival of C. edulis plants. Overall, we found strong evidence that C. edulis is negatively affected by the attack of its specialist herbivore, but not by that of generalist herbivore, regardless of origin. The observed tolerance to generalist herbivores suggests the intriguing possibility of trait selection, allowing C. edulis plants to tolerate generalist herbivores more than specialists.

AB  - A large amount of estrogen is introduced into the feed to improve livestock growth, excessive residual estrogen would exist in the excrements. The accumulation of estrogen can cause the water and soil pollution around the farm, further inhibit growth and induce caner for organisms and human. Anaerobic digestion (AD) could effectively remove estrogen in livestock manure while the mechanism is still unclear. In this study, the mechanism of estrogen removal by AD was explored during AD process of pig manure. Estrone (E1), estradiol (E2) estriol (E3) and ethinylestradiol (EE2) were selected as research subjects. The removal rates of E1, E2, E3 and EE2 were 19.14, 28.62, 25.83 and 11.81%. Dissolved organic matters (DOM), especially humic acid, play an important role in reducing bioavailability of estrogen. Estrogen will be absorbed by DOM through structures such as aromatic ring and amides. Estrogen may also promote the growth of microorganisms which could degrade estrogen, such as Rhodococcus, Sphingomonas and Pseudomonas. The amount of these microorganisms and dissolved microbial metabolites did not change obviously. This study would give a new explanation for the removal of estrogen and can provide theoretical support for harmless treatment of pig manure.

AB  - Pesticide resistance in medically significant disease vectors can negatively impact the efficacy of control efforts. Resistance research on ticks has focused primarily on species of veterinary significance that experience relatively high degrees of control pressure. Resistance in tick vectors of medical significance has received little attention, in part because area-wide pesticide applications are not used to control these generalist tick species. One of the few effective methods currently used for area-wide control of medically important ticks, including Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae), is deployment of 4-poster devices. Deer self-apply a topical acaricide (permethrin) while feeding on corn from the devices. A 4-poster program using permethrin has been deployed on Shelter Island, NY to control I. scapularis populations since 2008. We collected engorged female ticks from deer in this management area and a location in the Mid-Hudson River Valley, NY without area-wide tick control. Larvae were reared from egg masses and their susceptibility to permethrin was tested. Larvae originating from a long-term laboratory colony were used as a susceptible baseline for comparison. Compared against the laboratory colony, resistance ratios at LC-50 for Shelter Island and Hudson Valley I. scapularis were 1.87 and 1.51, respectively. The susceptibilities of the field populations to permethrin were significantly lower than that of the colony ticks. We provide the first data using the larval packet test to establish baseline susceptibility for I. scapularis to permethrin along with information relevant to understanding resistance emergence in tick populations under sustained control pressure from 4-poster devices.

AB  - Princess parrotfish Scarus taeniopterus is one of the top three parrotfish species landed in the Caribbean, and the top Scarus species targeted in commercial fishing efforts; however, a paucity of information exists concerning basic life history information for Caribbean parrotfish species. Prior to this work, no comprehensive life history information existed in the literature for princess parrotfish. This study provides the first comprehensive documentation of age, growth, size/age at sexual maturity, and size/age at transition for a Caribbean Scarus species. Sampling of 759 fish occurred in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands from October 2015 to February 2020. Females ranged from 50 to 250 mm total length (TL) and 0 to 7 years of age, males ranged from 159 to 314 mm TL and 2 to 11 years, and transitional fish ranged from 140 to 292 mm TL and 2 to 6 years. Previously unknown von Bertalanffy parameters (L-infinity = 301 and k = 0.316) and length at median sexual maturity (LM50 = 119 mm TL), age at median sexual maturity (AM(50) = 1.5 years), length at median sexual transition (LS50 = 223 mm TL), and age at median sexual transition (AS(50) = 4.2 years) will enable stock assessments and informed management for this Caribbean parrotfish.

AB  - Wildlife health and conservation are increasingly recognized as key to improving human, animal, and environmental health (One Health) and detecting and addressing threats such as altered distribution and transmission of zoonotic diseases due to climate change. Wildlife, and therefore wildlife management, are crucial for the livelihood and well-being of people in the Canadian North, a vast geographic area with low population density and socio-economic disparities, which can make widespread program implementation challenging. We analyzed and compared 4 case studies on collaborative programs on wildlife health management from 4 distinct jurisdictions in the Canadian North: the Yukon, chronic wasting disease surveillance in ungulates; Northwest Territories, rabies in arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus); Nunavut, foodborne diseases in harvested wildlife; and Nunavik, Qu & eacute;bec, ringed seal (Pusa hispida) health and Trichinella in walrus (Odobenus rosmarus). The case studies differed in whether they focused on a specific pathogen, transmission route, or health of a specific wildlife population. Despite these differences, 3 main themes were common to all case studies: collaboration, infrastructure limitations, and adaptation. Collaboration promotes greater community buy-in and investment as community members help shape the program and is key to long-term success, sustainability, and local relevance. Laboratory infrastructure and human resource capacity are limited in most regions, highlighting the importance of collaboration among Indigenous-managed boards and organizations, community members, government agencies at multiple levels, academic institutions, and the national wildlife health non-governmental organization (Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative). Examples of adaptations include capitalizing on wildlife harvest for fur and food to obtain samples for surveillance, developing regulations to train and permit veterinary paraprofessionals and community volunteers to facilitate co-existence of pets and people with wildlife reservoirs of rabies, jointly developing regulations to prevent introduction of non-endemic diseases, and adapting hunting locations based on the results of wildlife disease monitoring. Combining Indigenous knowledge and a One Health framework is fundamental to co-managing zoonotic and food-borne diseases in wildlife while respecting Indigenous ways of life. The case studies provide meaningful examples of collaboration and solutions to address complex problems at the One Health interface and to use a holistic and community-based approach to facilitate the creation of regionally acceptable and culturally relevant programs, with better outcomes for wildlife, human, and environmental health.

AB  - Mayotte is a small tropical island in the Comoros archipelago. It became recently a French department and much of its food, especially meat, is imported from abroad. The development of livestock farming is therefore a necessity. To understand the problems faced by Mahoran farmers, we organised semi-directive interviews with 15 farmers who reared cattle, sheep, goats or poultry. The first difficulty of farmers was limited access to land, especially for ruminants. This led to feed shortages. Another difficulty was the limited access to water and the poor quality of the roads to reach the farms. Poultry farmers were too dependent on importations of feed and laying hen or broiler genotypes from metropolitan France. The lack of organization for independent food productions (absence of abattoirs, cooperatives or organised markets) is also an obstacle to the development of the sector. Animal health, although not considered a major problem, has been a nuisance in the past (anthrax in cattle or salmonella in poultry). Mahoran farmers trust veterinarians or their assistants to manage health, although they complain about the high cost. Surprisingly, farmers use traditional medicine for many of their ailments, mostly based on local plants, but rarely for animals. Overall, our study reveals that larger land areas, better availability of money for investment and access to water and fodder are urgently required to improve livestock production and economic viability of farmers in Mayotte.

AB  - As the use of coastal and offshore environments expands, there is a need to better understand the exposure of marine megafauna to anthropogenic activities that potentially threaten their populations. Individual satellite telemetry studies are often hampered by small sample sizes, providing limited information on spatiotemporal distributions of migratory animals and their relationships to anthropogenic threats. We addressed this issue by synthesising satellite tracking data from 484 individuals of three taxonomic groups and six species; three marine turtle, two whale and one shark. The spatial overlap between taxa distributions and multiple anthropogenic activities was assessed as a proxy for the cumulative exposure of these taxa to anthropogenic threats (coastal modification, vessel strike, underwater noise, oil spill, bycatch, entanglement, and artificial light) across an area totalling 2,205,740 km(2) off north-western Australia. Core exposure areas (top 50% of the distribution) encompassed ecologically important sites for all taxa, such as the Ningaloo and Pilbara regions, migratory routes for whales and sharks in offshore waters beyond Ningaloo Reef, and marine turtle nesting beaches at Barrow Island and Cape Lambert. Although areas of high exposure represented <14% of taxa distributions, we showed that no taxa occurred in the absence of threats and that even areas with existing spatial protections are experiencing high levels of exposure. Importantly, we developed a robust approach for documenting the potential exposure of marine species to a range of human activities at appropriate spatial scales to inform conservation management.

AB  - This annotated checklist documents the diversity of cartilaginous fishes, including sharks, batoids (rays and skates), and chimaeras, from Panay and Guimaras islands, Western Visayas, Philippines, through surveys at fish markets and ports. A total of fourteen species were sampled and identified, including one chimaera, six sharks, and seven batoids from ten families (Chimaeridae, Hemiscylliidae, Scyliorhinidae, Carcharhinidae, Pristiophoridae, Rhinobatidae, Plesiobatidae, Urolophidae, Dasyatidae, andAetobatidae). Among these, the presence of the sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus (Nardo, 1827) in Philippine waters is confirmed for the first time, whereas a potential unidentified batoid species within the genera Himantura M & uuml;ller et Henle, 1837 and Urolophus M & uuml;ller et Henle, 1837 are reported. The twelve nominal taxa described herein include three species classified as Least Concern, five are Near Threatened, two Vulnerable, one Endangered, and one is Critically Endangered as per the IUCN Red List assessments. These documented species supplement recent inventories, expanding our knowledge on the diversity and distribution of cartilaginous fishes in the region and country, while also providing comprehensive morphological descriptions, validated molecular data, and curated voucher specimens for future reference.

AB  - Installing conservation fences to prohibit feral animal access to wetlands can become a barrier for non-target species of interest. We collected 161 turtles (Chelodina rugosa, Emydura subglobosa worrelli, Myuchelys latisternum) from twenty floodplain and riverine wetlands during post-wet (June-August) and late-dry season (November-December) surveys (2015-2018) in northern Australia. Wetlands were fenced (150 x 150 mm square, 1.05 m high wire mesh) or unfenced around the wet perimeter. Ninety-seven percent of individuals caught in either fenced or unfenced wetlands had a shell carapace width greater than mesh width, of these 44 (46%) were captured inside fenced wetlands, while 50 were caught in unfenced wetlands. The remaining 35 turtles were smaller than 150 mm and would likely pass easily through fence mesh. Sixty-five turtles partook in a fencing manipulative experiment. Turtles with carapace widths wider than mesh often successfully escaped through fences by lifting one side of their shell and passing diagonally through the mesh. In a second experiment where a piece of vertical wire (1500 x 300 mm) was removed, turtles located 'gates' after prospecting and fitting through meshing areas that were too small to pass. Ninety-two percent of turtles were able to locate and pass through gates, while 8% failed to locate a gate after 2 h. Gates applied every 4 m showed an 83% passage rate, every 2 m was 91%, and every 1 m was 100%. Combing field and manipulative experiments revealed that large turtles will prospect and move along a fence until they find suitable passage, which has important consequences when considering that gates could be easily retrofitted to existing sites, as well in new fencing programs, which has enormous positive conservation benefits for turtles in an already challenging and changing floodplain environment.

AB  - The development of coastal adaptation pathways along sandy barrier-island coasts requires an understanding of multi-decadal barrier morphodynamics in response to forcings such as sea-level rise, sediment fluxes, and storminess. Long-and cross-shore sand exchanges among barrier-system compartments (shorefaces, beaches, dunes, tidal inlets, backbarrier lagoons) and between adjacent barrier islands can play a fundamental role in barrier-system morphology and resilience to sea-level rise. We explore these dynamics through investigation of historical areal changes within the 13 largely undeveloped Virginia Barrier Islands of the United States Mid Atlantic Coast. We pair subaerial island areas mapped from historical surveys and modern aerial and satellite imagery with representative island thicknesses determined from stratigraphic and lidar-derived elevation data to estimate volumetric changes through time. Overall, the Virginia Barrier Islands lost-3.4% (16 x 106 m3) of their 1887 C.E. volume between 1887 and 2017 C.E. The loss from three central islands (Parramore, Hog, and Cobb)- historically characterized by rotational behavior-was 43% (79 x 106 m3). In particular, Parramore Island continuously decreased in volume over the 20th and 21st centuries. In contrast, growth of Assateague and northern Wallops islands (located at the northern, updrift end of the island chain) from 1887 to 2017 C.E. resulted in a volume increase of-59 x 106 m3. Whereas the Virginia Barrier Islands as a whole modestly decreased in size (and thus volume) directly in response to storm impacts and accelerating relative sea-level rise since the mid-1800s, the differential behavior of islands south of Assateague suggests more regional controls on coastal geomorphic behavior. Specifically, we identify the roles of antecedent substrate, sand trapping and changing wave-refraction patterns associated with the growth of Assateague Island, and inter-island sand exchanges in response to changing updrift barrier-scale behaviors. These findings help to better understand the underlying mechanisms behind state changes of barrier islands; in particular, the mechanisms by which geomorphic change along one barrier island influences those located several to tens of kilometers downdrift. This highlights the need to consider coastal beach and sand management over long reaches, even in systems which are largely unaffected by development, nourishment, and shoreline hardening.

AB  - Sea hares are cryptic, herbivorous sea slugs present on many coral reefs worldwide. Although they are known to consume high quantities of macroalgae, they are rarely considered or quantified in assessing algal suppression. Their role as algal suppressors is not well understood, therefore this study sought to quantify sea hare herbivory on the abundant red algal genus Laurencia. The sea hares Aplysia dactylomela, Dolabella auricularia and Dolabella sp. were collected and used in herbivory trials in aquaria at Heron Island on the Southern Great Barrier Reef to quantify their rate of consumption. A. dactylomela consumed 76.9 g partially dried weight of Laurencia per 24-h, which was significantly more than the other species, with D. auricularia consuming an average of 22.5 g and Dolabella sp. consuming 37.4 g partially dried weight. Consumption of Laurencia by A. dactylomela increased with body size, with the exception of the smallest animals, which ate up to 12.5 times their body weight. D. auricularia consumed significantly more algae than was lost in control tanks. Although we observed Dolabella sp. feeding on Laurencia, the amount consumed was not significantly different to loss of algae in control tanks. The rate of herbivory on Laurencia by A. dactylomela is comparable or greater than that of more commonly studied reef herbivores such as fishes and urchins, which suggests that they may contribute to algal suppression on coral reefs and further studies are warranted to evaluate their possible role in coral-algal phase shift dynamics.

AB  - We derive recent surface mass balance (SMB) estimates from airborne radar observations along the iSTAR traverse (2013, 2014) at Pine Island Glacier (PIG), West Antarctica. Ground-based neutron probe measurements provide information of snow and firn density with depth at 22 locations and were used to date internal annual reflection layers. The 2005 layer was traced for a total distance of 2367 km to determine annual mean SMB for the period 2005-2014. Using complementary SMB estimates from two regional climate models, RACMO2.3p2 and MAR, and a geostatistical kriging scheme, we determine a regional-scale SMB distribution with similar main characteristics to that determined for the period 1985-2009 in previous studies. Local departures exist for the northern PIG slopes, where the orographic precipitation shadow effect appears to be more pronounced in our observations, and the southward interior, where the SMB gradient is more pronounced in previous studies. We derive total mass inputs of 79.9 +/- 19.2 and 82.1 +/- 19.2 Gtyr(-1) to the PIG basin based on complementary ASIRAS-RACMO and ASIRAS-MAR SMB estimates, respectively. These are not significantly different to the value of 78.3 +/- 6.8 Gtyr(-1) for the period 1985-2009. Thus, there is no evidence of a secular trend at decadal scales in total mass input to the PIG basin. We note, however, that our estimated uncertainty is more than twice the uncertainty for the 1985-2009 estimate on total mass input. Our error analysis indicates that uncertainty estimates on total mass input are highly sensitive to the selected krige methodology and assumptions made on the interpolation error, which we identify as the main cause for the increased uncertainty range compared to the 1985-2009 estimates.

AB  - During the 2020-2021 trips, the bat fauna of Hon Tre Island, located in Nha Trang Bay in Khanh Hoa Province, Vietnam, was studied for the first time. Despite the small size of the island and the lack of fresh water sources on it, we revealed the presence of at least nine bat species from four families, which were captured and studied in the hand. The family Pteropodidae is represented by Cynopterus sphinx, an extremely ecologically flexible species, and also by Rousettus leschenaulti and Eonycteris spelaea; family Hipposideridae - by three species of Hipposideros: H. grandis, H. galeritus and H. gentilis; family Rhinolophidae - by Rhinolophus cf. pusillus and R. pearsonii; family Megadermatidae - by Megaderma spasma. Mitochondrial DNA sequences were obtained for six individuals of three species, which made it possible to confirm morphology-based identifications of the captured animals. In particular, this concerned R. pearsonii, whose specimens differed from those known from the mainland, primarily by their smaller size. The presence of a multi-species bat community on Hon Tre Island necessitates careful planning of tourism and infrastructure development, in order to minimize impact on the natural habitats of the island.

TI  - First Report of Biofluorescence in Arctic Snailfishes and Rare Occurrence of Multiple Fluorescent Colors in a Single Species
T2  - AMERICAN MUSEUM NOVITATES
LA  - English
AB  - Biofluorescence has recently been reported to be phylogenetically widespread and phenotypically variable across bony fishes, and is most common in tropical coral reef lineages. Here we provide the first documentation of prominent biofluorescence in Arctic fishes including two juvenile specimens of Liparis gibbus (variegated snailfish) collected from the coastal waters of Eastern Greenland, as well as an adult L. tunicatus (kelp snailfish) collected in the Bering Strait off of Little Diomede Island, AK. Observations of L. gibbus were made during nighttime dives within kelp forests in iceberg habitats in Southeastern Greenland in August 2019. The juvenile L. gibbus specimens exhibit both green (523-530 nm) and red (674-678 nm) biofluorescence on discrete anatomical areas, which provides a rare example of multiple fluorescent colors emitted from a single individual. Notably, the adult L. tunicatus emitted only red fluorescence in a bilaterally symmetrical pattern of discrete red dots and blotches. Potential weak green biofluorescence was also noted in a flatfish (Hippoglossoides platessoides) collected in Greenland, but in no other Arctic species. As the distribution and function of biofluorescence in marine fishes is further examined, this report adds context to its widespread geographical and environmental distributions, and shows that, although rare, biofluorescence does occur in Arctic fish lineages.

AB  - Finding food is a key motivator of animal behavior and underpins an increasing number of conservation and wildlife management challenges. Introduced predators threaten many vulnerable native species, and some native predators are problematic for declining prey species. Likewise, browsing by native and introduced herbivores threatens endangered plant species, undermines habitat restoration efforts, and alters plant communities. Mammalian predators and herbivores use olfactory information to forage efficiently, pursuing cues that are useful and ignoring those that are not. Here, we present the theoretical basis for why olfactory misinformation should alter foraging decisions and provide compelling evidence that supports the theory. Drawing on this theory and evidence of the success of olfactory misinformation where it has been applied to date, we propose that there is enormous scope for its application more broadly in conservation and wildlife management. Such an approach offers a robust behavioral alternative for protecting valued plants and prey species that are otherwise vulnerable to foraging mammals.

AB  - Prairie restorations typically differ from remnant prairies in forb composition; long-lived, late-successional plants are often missing. To study establishment of such species, we set up a field experiment where seeds of the threatened, long-lived Asclepias meadii were sown individually into the field with initial fire and soil disturbance treatments. We returned each year for 11 years to record the presence/absence, size, and reproduction of each plant. Individual plants were sometimes observed 1 year, not observed a subsequent year, and then observed again. We therefore analyzed survival data with mark-recapture models and found that the probability of a seed germinating and the resulting plant surviving for 11 years was 0.057 (5.7%). Probability of detection was approximately 0.80, suggesting that we did not observe all living plants. Vegetative dormancy, herbivory on above-ground parts, and observer error could all be responsible. We found no relationship between plant survival and the initial burn/disturbance treatment or previous year precipitation. Plants that were observed in the last study year were individuals that had, on average, greater size in earlier years. Three plants produced flowers and two produced fruit; we believe such reproductive success has not been previously documented for seed of A. meadii sowed into a restoration site. Our restoration study dovetails with the more typical plant community restoration research. In such studies, seeds of many species are sown, but often the late successional species do not establish. We show the value of detailed multiyear monitoring to determine the fate of such plant introductions.

AB  - The chloroplast genome of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch was sequenced to investigate intraspecific variations on the chloroplast genome. Its length is 127,689 bp long (34.3% GC ratio) with atypical structure of chloroplast genome, which is congruent to those of Glycyrrhiza genus. It includes 110 genes (76 protein-coding genes, four rRNAs, and 30 tRNAs). Intronic region of ndhA presented the highest nucleotide diversity based on the six G. uralenesis chloroplast genomes. A total of 150 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 10 insertion and deletion (INDEL) regions were identified from the six G. uralensis chloroplast genomes. Phylogenetic trees show that the six chloroplast genomes of G. uralensis formed the two clades, requiring additional studies to understand it.

AB  - Muskrats are one of North America's most widely distributed semi-aquatic mammals; however, populations are declining in many areas of North America yet expanding as an invasive species elsewhere. Its importance in native habitats and impacts in non-native environments warrants investigation into their habitat requirements. We compared the influence of several environmental factors to determine drivers of habitat selection. We hypothesized that distance to vegetation, vegetation type, distance to beaver lodges, beaver presence, and pond morphometry would influence muskrat habitat use. Through field surveys and GIS analyses, we used logistic regression and non-parametric approaches to assess various habitat metrics. Relative to randomly created points, muskrat huts were closer to adjacent vegetation, with more huts adjacent to cattail stands than other types of vegetation, although rushes (Juncus sp.) were most heavily browsed by muskrats. Although there were more huts and push-ups on occupied beaver ponds than on abandoned ponds, overall presence of muskrats did not differ. Push-ups exhibited random placement in ponds and weak associations with other variables, despite being adjacent to smaller vegetation stands with higher browse intensity than huts. Understanding habitat use allows unique insights into a species declining in native habitats yet creating ongoing challenges as an invasive species.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) and heavy metals (HMs) are important pollutants in terrestrial ecosystems. In particular, the "island" landscape's weak resistance makes it vulnerable to pollution. However, there is a lack of research on MPs and HMs in island landscapes. Therefore, we used Helan Mountain as the research area. Assess the concentrations, spatial distribution, ecological risks, sources, and transport of MPs and HMs in the soil and blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) feces. Variations in geographical distribution showed a connection between human activity and pollutants. Risk assessment indicated soil and wildlife were influenced by long-term pollutant polarization and multi-element inclusion (Igeo, Class I; PHI, Class V; RI (MPs), 33 % Class II, and 17 % Class IV; HI = 452.08). Source apportionment showed that tourism and coal combustion were the primary sources of pollutants. Meanwhile, a new coupling model of PMF/Risk was applied to quantify the source contribution of various risk types indicated transportation roads and tourism sources were the main sources of ecological and health risks, respectively. Improve the traceability of pollution source risks. Furthermore, also developed a novel tracing model for pollutant transportation, revealing a unique "source-sink-source" cycle in pollutant transportation, which provides a new methodological framework for the division of pollution risk areas in nature reserves and the evaluation of spatial transport between sources and sinks. Overall, this study establishes a foundational framework for conducting comprehensive risk assessments and formulating strategies for pollution control and management.

AB  - The brown shrimp Penaeus aztecus Ives, 1891, a well-established alien species in the Mediterranean Sea, is here recorded from Croatia (central-northern Adriatic Sea) on the basis of 18 specimens found since November 2016. Such numbers triple the number of confirmed specimens known from the basin so far and testify its northern spreading in the Adriatic Sea. There are no certainties regarding possible pathway(s) of arrival of this species in the area. However, unaided dispersal from neighbouring countries constitutes the most probable one, although introduction through ballast water or deliberate introduction or escape from aquaculture facilities cannot be ruled out. All the specimens were captured while trawling on muddy substrates at depths ranging from 50 to 200 m, and were communicated to the authors of the present note by local fishermen. This confirms the importance of fishermen knowledge to detect the occurrence of non- indigenous megafauna in the Adriatic Sea as a complementary tool to proper scientific surveys.

AB  - Although the glaciers in the Antarctic periphery currently modestly contribute to sea level rise, their contribution is projected to increase substantially until the end of the 21st century. The South Shetland Islands (SSI), located to the north of the Antarctic Peninsula, are lacking a geodetic mass balance calculation for the entire archipelago. We estimated its geodetic mass balance over a 3-4-year period within 2013-2017. Our estimation is based on remotely sensed multispectral and interferometric SAR data covering 96% of the glacierized areas of the islands considered in our study and 73% of the total glacierized area of the SSI archipelago (Elephant, Clarence, and Smith Islands were excluded due to data limitations). Our results show a close to balance, slightly negative average specific mass balance for the whole area of -0.106 +/- 0.007 m w.e. a(-1), representing a mass change of -238 +/- 12 Mt a(-1). These results are consistent with a wider scale geodetic mass balance estimation and with glaciological mass balance measurements at SSI locations for the same study period. They are also consistent with the cooling trend observed in the region between 1998 and the mid-2010s.

AB  - PurposeArsenic (As) in soils threatens plant growth and food safety, requiring sustainable mitigation. This study examined the conversion of sheep wool (SW) to hydrolyzed keratin (HK) and its impact on spinach under As stress.MethodsThe treatments were as follows: 1-Control, 2-As toxicity [As, 30 mg As kg- 1], 3-As + HK1 [30 mg As and 1.0 mL HK kg- 1 soil], 4-As + HK2 [30 mg As and 1.5 mL HK kg- 1 soil], 5-As + HK3 [30 mg As and 2.0 mL HK kg- 1 soil].ResultsFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis revealed that while both SW and HK shared similarities due to their keratin content, hydrolysis introduced significant modifications. Peaks at 1527, 1643, and 2347 cm(-)(1) observed in SW were altered, with stronger peaks at 1373 and 1585 cm(-)(1) and new peaks at 2550 and 3250 cm(-)(1) appearing in HK, indicating increased solubility and functionalization. In As-contaminated soil, HK application especially at the highest dose significantly improved spinach biomass and reduced As accumulation from 0.75 to 0.22 mg kg(-)(1), while also enhancing plant N concentrations. FTIR analysis of spinach showed that As toxicity weakened peaks at 1028, 2920, and 3275 cm(-)(1) and eliminated those at 1236, 1317, and 1402 cm(-)(1), indicating disrupted cell wall structure or reduced carbohydrate synthesis. HK application partially restored these peaks and introduced a new one at 2328 cm(-)(1).ConclusionHydrolyzed keratin enhances plant growth and mitigates As toxicity, demonstrating its potential as a sustainable amendment for improving crop resilience in contaminated soils.

AB  - Estimating population abundance is central to many ecological studies and important in conservation planning. Yet the elusive nature of many species makes estimating their abundance challenging. Abundance estimates of sea turtles, marine birds, and seals are usually made when breeding adults are ashore, while life stages spent at sea, including as juveniles, are often poorly sampled. We used a combination of high-resolution satellite tracking (Fastloc-GPS), uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys, and capture-mark-recapture approaches to assess the abundance of immature hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) and green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in a tidal lagoon of the Chagos Archipelago (Indian Ocean). We captured, marked, and released 50 turtles (48 hawksbill and 2 green turtles) prior to UAV surveys and used satellite tracking data from 27 immature turtles (25 hawksbill and 2 green turtles) to refine the estimated numbers of marked turtles available for resighting and those likely to have emigrated from the study area. We estimated a total of 339 turtles in the lagoon with a density variation at different tidal heights between 265 turtles km(-2) at high water and 499 turtles km(-2) at low water. Of these, 91% were hawksbills and 9% were green turtles. These hawksbill densities are the highest reported among 17 foraging sites recorded around the world and likely reflect successful long-term protection of turtles in the Chagos Archipelago.

AB  - <bold>Introduction:</bold> It is unclear whether plants and microorganisms achieve niche complementarity by taking up different inorganic nitrogen (N) forms to alleviate N competition, particularly in N-limited regions. <bold>Methods:</bold> This paper conducted a 15-day N-15 tracer study ((NH4NO3)-N-15 or (NH4NO3)-N-15) in situ to quantitatively calculate the uptake rates of plants and microorganisms in four stands (pure Hippophae rhamnoides L, pure Pinus tabuliformis Carri & egrave;re, mixed H. rhamnoides-P. tabuliformis, and Artemisia gmelinii Weber ex Stechm grassland) in the forest-grassland transition zone on the Loess Plateau during the growing season. Among them, H. rhamnoides and P. tabuliformis can associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal, respectively. <bold>Results:</bold> The results indicated that H. rhamnoides in the pure stand and A. gmelinii preferred to take up (NO3-)-N-15, whereas P. tabuliformis in the pure stand preferred (NH4+)-N-15. Compared to pure stands, mixed afforestation decreased the NH4+ and NO3- uptake rate of H. rhamnoides by 87% and 70%, respectively, but did not alter the N preference of plants. Plants and microorganisms differed in their N preferences in the pure stand, whereas this was not the case in the mixed stand. The proportional similarity index between H. rhamnoides and P. tabuliformis (0.90 +/- 0.01) was higher than that between plants and microorganisms in forest stands, except for P. tabuliformis and microorganisms in the mixed stand (0.90 +/- 0.02). <bold>Discussion:</bold> Those results indicated that niche complementarity by preferring different N forms can alleviate N competition. This study helped to gain a deeper understanding of the plasticity of N uptake patterns by plants and microorganisms in the forest-grassland transition zone, and provides theoretical support for vegetation restoration during the implementation of the Grain for Green program on the Loess Plateau.

AB  - L-carnitine, an increasingly vital compound in livestock nutrition, plays a pivotal role in facilitating the beta -oxidation of fatty acids. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of L-carnitine supplementation, administered at varying doses, on pregnancy toxemia susceptible goats. A total of 150 goats underwent estrus synchronization, natural mating, and pregnancy confirmation. Among these, 90 goats carrying multiple fetuses were categorized into three groups on the 100th day of pregnancy, with their feed supplemented as follows: CAR50 (50 mg/kg of L-carnitine), CAR100 (100 mg/kg of L-carnitine), and CON (control without Lcarnitine). Subsequently, blood samples were collected from 15 randomly selected goats from each group on days 100, 115, 130, and 145 of pregnancy to quantify serum levels of beta-HBA (beta-hydroxybutyrate) and NEFA (non-esterified fatty acids), alongside glucose levels. Dietary supplementation of L-carnitine did not exert a significant impact on blood glucose levels in the CAR50 and CAR100 groups, in comparison to the CON group, during the third trimester of pregnancy (P>0.05). Nevertheless, serum NEFA levels exhibited a noteworthy reduction in the CAR50 and CAR100 groups compared to the CON group on day 145 (P<0.01). Furthermore, no substantial fluctuations in mean NEFA and beta-HBA levels were observed in the CAR100 group between days 100 and 145 of gestation (P>0.05). The body condition score exhibited consistent maintenance both within and between groups (P>0.05). To conclude, this study underscores the efficacy of dietary supplementation with L-carnitine in mitigating ketone and NEFA levels in pregnant goats, particularly when administered at a dosage of 100 mg/kg. Consequently, the integration of a standardized quantity of Lcarnitine into the diet holds the potential to serve as a valuable preventive strategy for goats susceptible to pregnancy toxemia.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) is an escalating humanitarian issue and a conservation concern. In terms of protection and management, areas at high risk of HWC are not necessarily afforded the same resources as areas prioritized for protection. To improve allocation of limited protection resources and HWC mitigation efficiency, we determined management priorities based on HWC risk and people's attitudes toward wildlife around the Giant Panda National Park. We constructed an ensemble species distribution model with 1959 species' distribution loci and 337 conflict event records. This model was used to simulate the spatial distribution patterns of HWC risk and to evaluate the influence of diverse environmental factors. A survey of people's attitudes toward wildlife was conducted in 155 villages around the Giant Panda National Park. Priority areas for HWC management were concentrated near protected areas, where wildlife habitats and populations were recovering and expanding. We obtained 947 questionnaires, which showed that some residents were highly aware of conservation and had a high tolerance for wildlife, even when they were living in areas at high risk of HWC. However, people who had encountered conflicts with wild boar were more likely to have negative attitudes toward other wildlife, even giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). Thus, HWC may lead to the generalization of negative attitudes toward wildlife conservation. In our study area, environmental (e.g., building fences and changing crop types) and social measures (e.g., insurance and ecocompensation) have been implemented to mitigate HWC. Our results can provide an important basis for the allocation of compensation resources and improvement of HWC management in areas of high conservation priority. Future studies should further explore how to develop more personalized HWC management plans based on the characteristics of different regions.

AB  - The open nucleus breeding system (ONBS) has been widely employed in livestock breeding and has demonstrated a desirable genetic gain compared to the traditional closed nucleus breeding system (CNBS). However, no related study and application for ONBS exist on aquatic animal breeding. The present investigation simulates the family-based ONBS with different proportions of introduced multiplier individuals used as parents of the nucleus population (NP) and CNBS schemes for the harvest body weight of the Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). The multiplier population (MP) comprised progenies from eight families with high estimated breeding value (EBV) or genomic EBV (GEBV) of NP of the previous generation. ONBS was assigned three proportions (10%, 30%, and 50%) of the introduced MP individuals. The short-term selection (G0 to G10) and long-term selection (G0 to G20) were performed for CNBS and ONBS schemes using pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (PBLUP) with the A relationship matrix from the pedigree or single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) with the H relationship matrix integrating SNP markers and pedigree. The genetic gain of body weight and inbreeding coefficient of NP for eight breeding schemes with CNBS_PBLUP (CP), CNBS_ssGLUP (CS), ONBS_PBLUP (OP10, OP30, OP50), and ONBS_ssGBLUP (OS10, OS30, OS50) with three proportions of the introduced MP individuals were calculated. Compared to CP, genetic gains for the three OP schemes increased by 7.68 to 11.27% after short-term selection, and by 2.51 to 5.79% after long-term selection. In comparison to CS, genetic gains for the three OS schemes increased by 8.21 to 8.96% after short-term selection, and from 4.46 to 5.87% after long-term selection. The ONBS schemes achieved higher genetic gains than the corresponding CNBS schemes whether using genomic or pedigree information. The advantage of ONBS over CNBS is reduced after long-term selection. Genetic gains for the three OS schemes increased by 9.77 to 14.06% after long-term selection compared with the corresponding OP schemes. Furthermore, no significant difference (P > 0.05) in genetic gain was revealed among the ONBS schemes after either pedigree-based or genomic selection. Inbreeding coefficients for the three OP schemes increased from 59.45 to 70.98% compared with CP, whereas inbreeding coefficients for the three OS schemes increased from 24.72 to 32.22% compared with CS. Besides, after long-term selection, inbreeding coefficients for the three OS schemes decreased from 13.13 to 14.79% compared with the corresponding OP schemes. In a nutshell, ONBS using introduced MP individuals has great promise in the selective breeding program of L. vannamei. Genomic information has more potential to improve selection response and control inbreeding level than pedigree information when applying ONBS.

AB  - The Inner Asian Mountain Corridor (IAMC) acted as a crossroads of trans-Eurasian exchange since approximately 6000 cal.yr BP. The history of the introduction and utilization of crops and livestock in the area has been intensively discussed, while geographical-temporal variations of human activities and subsistence strategies remain unclear. Here we report new zooarchaeological data and radiocarbon dates from the Naba Cemeteries, revealing herbivorous livestock were predominant animal resource during both the Bronze and Early Iron Ages, and sheep/goat and horse were paramount sacrificial animals in these two periods, respectively. In tandem with published radiocarbon dates, zooarchaeological and archaeobotanical data from IAMC's prehistoric sites, we detect humans mainly engaged in hunting-gathering games in the IAMC during 8000-5000 cal. yr BP. During 5000-4000 cal. yr BP, the territory of agro-pastoral groups evidently expanded in the IAMC with a hotspot in the Altai Region, and wheat and barley were introduced into the area. In the following two millennia, herding became an economic mainstay, and cultivations of crops were ubiquitous in the IAMC's oases. We argue that prehistoric human activities in the IAMC were mainly affected by agro-pastoral expansions associated with exchanges across the Eurasia, which was likely promoted by climate change.

AB  - Herbivores play an essential role in the health and recovery of a coral reef ecosystem. The lack of recovery of the keystone herbivore Diadema antillarum has had long-lasting effects, evidenced with many reefs persisting in algal dominance. This study restocked 756 lab-reared D. antillarum to four coral reefs on the east and south coast of Puerto Rico. Sea urchins were placed in experimental plots ("corrals") for 2 months, and the change in benthic composition was measured. Significant changes in the benthic structure were observed during the first week after the restocking. Significant reductions of fleshy macroalgae (Dictyota spp.) and thick turf algal/sediment mats (TAS), both unsuitable substrates (e.g. coral settlement), contributed to this change. Also, restocked D. antillarum significantly reduced the cover of encrusting red algae, Ramicrusta spp. By the end of the study, the abundance of fleshy macroalgae decreased by a mean of 77% (max of 100%) and Ramicrusta and TAS by 53% (max 71%) and 56% (max 100%), respectively. Clean substrate ("pavement"), crustose coralline algae (CCA), and filamentous turf algae increased between one to two orders of magnitude. The restoration of native sea urchins is a non-invasive and useful approach to aid in the mitigation of algae, especially potentially dangerous alga like Ramicrusta. The results of this study highlight the importance of herbivores in improving the conditions on coral reefs.

AB  - The objective of the study was to characterize the adaptive profile of Ibero-American sheep of the Canaria breed, evaluating the possible changes in thermoregulatory responses and coat characteristics to which the animals are exposed in the different seasons of the year. Data collected over a period of 12 months were analyzed, with information being observed in the interval of 15 days of each month, in 23 adult ewes kept in an intensive breeding system. The rectal temperature (RT) of Canaria ewes was higher (P < 0.001) in the summer and spring seasons. In contrast, the respiratory rate (RR) of the animals was higher in autumn. The surface temperature (ST) of the herd was lower during the spring. It was observed that the hair length (HL) and the hair density (NH) did not vary during the seasons. However, the hair diameter (HD) and the coat thickness (CT) varied, being in the spring, the season in which the animals had the highest HD and autumn, the season in which they had the lowest. The performance was similar throughout the seasons (P > 0.05). The morphological variables of the coat presented 63.8% of original cases grouped, which may characterize the morphological responses of the coat of these animals as an important trait of the adaptive profile of the breed, whereas the opposite occurred for thermoregulatory responses. The variables most used by the herd and that were most important were autumn (CT, NH, HD, HR, RT, and HL), summer (ST and RR), spring (RR, ST, and RT), and winter (RT, HD, HR, and RR). Sheep of the Canaria breed have an adaptive profile that dynamically uses thermoregulatory and morphological responses, molding themselves according to climate changes resulting from seasonal periods on the Island of Tenerife, Spain. The Canaria sheep stood out for the modification of the morphological characteristics of the coat, especially during autumn and spring, and can be considered an excellent genetic resource with excellent adaptive characteristics for arid environments such as those found in the Canary Islands.

AB  - As high-quality sheep germplasm resources in China, Hu sheep are characterized by fast growth and development, high fecundity, and tolerance to drought and cold. Tibetan sheep, adapted to high-altitude environments, have developed strong environmental adaptability. To explore the differences in the interaction among rumen microbial flora, hepatic gluconeogenesis, and mitochondrial function between Tibetan sheep and Hu sheep in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, this study systematically compared and analyzed the rumen flora density, key enzyme activities related to hepatic gluconeogenesis and mitochondrial function, and the expression levels of related genes in Tibetan sheep and Hu sheep under identical feeding management conditions, followed by correlation analysis. The results showed that Hu sheep had significantly higher densities of Ruminobacteramylophilus (Ram) and Fibrobacter succinogenes (Fs) associated with starch and protein degradation (p < 0.01). The expression levels of Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), pyruvate carboxylase (PC) activity, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content were also significantly higher than those in Tibetan sheep (p < 0.01). In contrast, Tibetan sheep had higher densities of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (Bf), Ruminococcus albus (Ra), Ruminococcus flavefaciens (Rf), etc., related to cellulose degradation (p < 0.01). The gluconeogenesis-related genes, Glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 1 (G6PC1) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase1 (PCK1), and the activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) were significantly higher in Tibetan sheep than in Hu sheep (p < 0.01). Mitochondrial function-related genes Mitofusin-1 (Mfn1), Mitofusin-2 (Mfn2), subunit 6 of ATP synthase (ATP6), cytochrome b (Cytb), etc., also showed significantly higher expression in Tibetan sheep (p < 0.01). While no significant differences were observed in the contents of citric acid (CA), pyruvic acid (PA), glucose (Glu), etc. (p > 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that rumen flora was associated with the key enzyme activities and gene expressions of hepatic gluconeogenesis and mitochondrial function to varying degrees. In summary, Tibetan sheep exhibit strong fiber degradation capacity, the efficient utilization of gluconeogenic intermediates, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) ability, forming adaptive strategies for high-altitude environments. By contrast, Hu sheep show efficient protein and starch degradation capacity, thereby enhancing the supply of gluconeogenic precursors. It is indicated that when introducing Hu sheep to high-altitude areas, dietary intervention can be used to regulate rumen microorganisms, such as increasing fiber-decomposing bacteria or enhancing mitochondrial oxidative capacity, to counteract metabolic limitations induced by hypoxia.

AB  - Haastia pulvinaris (Asteraceae: Senecioneae) is endemic to alpine ecosystems in the north-eastern mountains of the Southern Alps of Te Waipounamu - South Island of Aotearoa - New Zealand. Two varieties are currently recognised: H. pulvinaris var. pulvinaris and H. pulvinaris var. minor. Univariate and multivariate analyses of 37 specimens resulted in the discovery of distinct differences between these varieties in, amongst others, branchlet diameter, leaf shape and the presence of an apical style tuft. Their consistent and distinct differences, even in sympatry, are evidence that the two varieties should be recognised as species: H. pulvinaris and H. minor comb. et stat. nov. Descriptions and distribution maps of each species are provided, together with illustrations and an identification key to all species and varieties of Haastia.

AB  - Background The restoration of lake ecosystems requires a good knowledge of the lake's history and the driving mechanism of environmental changes. In this study, we used Lake Datong, the largest inland lake in Hunan Province China, as an example to study the effects of aquaculture, based on historical data of aquatic creature, diatom inferred-total phosphorous (DI-TP) data, and an Ecopath model. Lake Datong has undergone several stages of aquaculture from 1980, with a rapid increase in fish production and fish feed supplementation at each stage. Its water quality has deteriorated since the introduction of aquaculture and the lake has become moderate eutrophic status. Results According to the DI-TP data, before 1930, Lake Datong was in a mesotrophic status (50-60 mu g/L DI-TP). Between 1930 and 1980, the number of nutrient-tolerant species increased slightly, which indicates a nutrient increase in the lake (66-83 mu g/L DI-TP). From the 1980s to 2010 and especially since 2000, eutrophication increased rapidly, with eutrophic species dominating the diatom assemblage, such as Stephanodiscus hantzschii, S. minutulus, and a sudden decrease in Aulacoseira granulata (< 10%). The annual average DI-TP concentration was 202 mu g/L. After 2010, DI-TP decreased to 127-152 mu g/L. In 2019, consumer biomass in Lake Datong was very low because the large-scale aquaculture was restricted by local government. The biomass of submerged macrophytes was relatively high, indicating that excessive primary producers had not been used by consumers and therefore, had not entered the food web. This led to a reduction in the energy transfer efficiency (TE) of the ecosystem. Conclusions The succession of the water ecosystem of Lake Datong is reappeared by DI-TP analysis and historical reference data. Lake Datong has experienced four stages of eutrophication succession following the introduction of aquaculture activities, with dramatic changes in the composition and biomass of its aquatic creatures. After comprehensive management in 2017, the consumer biomass of Lake Datong was at a relatively lower level, and the biomass of submerged macrophytes was higher, meaning a large quantity of primary producers had not been used by consumers, thus had not entered the food web, which consequently reduces the energy TE of the ecosystem. Future management needs to pay attention to making a suitable macrophyte harvest plan, stocking herbivorous and omnivorous fish, and establishing rational fishing, which can not only enhance the energy flows and nutrient cycling of the ecosystem, but also improve the food web structure. Our results provide important reference values and theoretical support for decision-makers and stakeholders in the subsequent management of similar shallow lake-water ecosystems.

AB  - Wetlands are amongst the world's most effective natural carbon sinks, and also have the potential to emit large quantities of stored carbon back into the atmosphere if disturbed. In the Murray-Darling Basin, high consumptive demand for water has led to widespread wetland loss and degradation. Remaining wetlands are commonly under additional pressure from grazing and trampling by feral herbivores or livestock and unseasonal flooding in summer to meet peak irrigation demand. Here, during a summer flood in Barmah National Park, we compared soil carbon and nitrogen and carbon emissions within, and outside of, a feral herbivore exclusion plot. The sustained global warming potential from the whole wetland (i.e., both within- and outside of the exclusion plot), totalled from both carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) emissions, averaged 132.27 +/- 9.88 g CO 2 -e m -2 d -1 , an estimated 28- to 89-fold higher than the global average for natural wetlands. The high warming potential of the wetland was driven strongly by CH 4 emissions, which made up over 90% of total CO 2 -equivalents, with CO 2 contributing < 10%. We expect these values represent peak CH 4 emissions from the site due to high water and soil temperatures, and low water levels, at the time of sampling. Soil carbon and nitrogen did not differ significantly within and outside of the exclusion plot, but surface soil samples indicated recent condition improvement in the absence of feral herbivores. We suggest that an emissions avoidance incentive could be developed around unseasonal, summer watering of forested floodplains where flood timing can be controlled.

AB  - To understand the causes and implications of an extinction event, detailed information is necessary. However, this can be challenging when working with poorly resolved paleontological data sets. One approach to increase the data resolution is by combining different methods. In this study, we used both radiocarbon and genetic data to reconstruct the population history and extinction dynamics of the woolly mammoth in northern Siberia. We generated 88 new radiocarbon dates and combined these with previously published dates from 626 specimens to construct Bayesian age models. These models show that mammoths disappeared on the eastern Siberian mainland before the onset of the Younger Dryas (12.9e11.7 ky cal BP). Mammoths did however persist in the northernmost parts of central and western Siberia until the early Holocene. Further genetic results of 131 high quality mitogenomes, including 22 new mitogenomes generated in this study, support the hypothesis that mammoths from, or closely related to, a central and/or west-Siberian population recolonized Wrangel Island over the now submerged northern Siberian plains. As mammoths became trapped on the island due to rising sea levels, they lived another ca. 6000 years on Wrangel Island before eventually going extinct ca. 4000 years ago.

AB  - Public perception of large carnivores is heterogeneous and contrasting attitudes of various stakeholder groups may create barriers to effective management. The most prominent disparities occur between hunters and conservationists. While dissatisfaction among hunters may lead to increased instances of illegal killing as a form of protest, conservationists' disapproval can impact public opinion, potentially eroding trust in management policy. We conducted a survey across Slovakia (n = 1071) to understand how different stakeholders perceive current management of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) and to identify key commonalities and potential conflicts of interests. We found broad consensus among stakeholders regarding high intrinsic value of lynx in Slovak nature and low potential for conflict regarding livestock damages caused by lynx. Majority of respondents, including hunters (63%), foresters (63%), and farmers (62%), supported the legal protection of lynx in Slovakia. Our study also demonstrates widespread support of the Slovak public (75%-88%) for reintroduction programs using Slovak lynx population as a resource. However, the majority of respondents (65%-75%) supported using primarily orphans and rehabilitated lynx for these programs. The greatest polarization between hunters and conservationists was observed in issues related to lynx population status and lynx heaving an impact on roe deer population. Approximately half of hunters believed lynx population over the past 20 years increased and that lynx poses a threat to the roe deer population, with over a third advocating for legal lynx hunting. These attitudes likely lead to the relatively widespread illegal killing on over similar to 50% of the lynx distribution range in Slovakia. Our data suggest that increasing public awareness of lynx, implementing adaptive science-based management, and involving hunters in citizen science and management decisions might be the most effective way to develop policies balancing conservation goals with the socio-cultural context of human-large carnivore coexistence.

AB  - Prior to its extirpation in the 1960s, Ovis canadensis texianus (a subspecies of desert bighorn sheep, DBS) occupied 16 mountain ranges in the Trans-Pecos Region of Texas. Restocking efforts relied on translocating individuals of DBS from Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Mexico. One recipient site, Elephant Mountain Wildlife Management Area (WMA), now the primary source-stock for translocations in Texas, was examined to measure its genomic ancestry compared to other DBS from the Great Basin, Mojave, and Sonoran deserts. Genomic data (5,434-62,749 single nucleotide polymorphisms) were used to estimate kinship, inbreeding, and effective population size across three time periods (2000, 2017, and 2019). Individuals genetically were most similar to DBS from the Gabbs Valley Range and Muddy Mountains, Nevada (Mojave DBS lineage). Strong signatures of inbreeding were not detected among individuals. In addition, genetic pedigree reconstruction revealed familial relationships, including a four-generation pedigree, and indicated 39.51% and 41.89% of individuals translocated in 2017 and 2019, respectively, were parent-offspring or full-sibling pairs, suggesting capture methods tend to sample highly related individuals. In 2017, population estimates for Elephant Mountain WMA indicated 182 individuals with an effective population size (N-e) of 65, whereas in 2019, N-e was 92 with an estimated population size of 186. Although reintroduction efforts to Elephant Mountain WMA were successful, recurrent epizootic events since 2019 have reduced the population sizes of DBS across the Trans-Pecos Region. Our data illustrate how population genomics and overall assessments of genetic diversity can and should be used to guide management and conservation of DBS.

AB  - Rewilding is a conservation strategy used to restore ecosystems to previous states and can involve the reintroduction of large carnivores into areas from where they had been previously extirpated. Whilst rewilding has been important for ecosystem functioning, it can have negative implications for naive prey that have had no exposure to the presence of large carnivores. Therefore, understanding prey responses to the reintroduction of predators is crucial for management and conservation. We assessed the effects of reintroduced cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) on the vigilance of two species of naive prey: the steenbok (Raphicerus campestris) and the springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis). We hypothesized that both species would increase their vigilance behaviour post-cheetah reintroduction, but that the steenbok would demonstrate a greater response due to their smaller body size and more solitary nature. To test this, we compared the vigilance of both species before and after the reintroduction of cheetahs. Both species increased vigilance within one year post-cheetah reintroduction, but the steenbok demonstrated a much stronger response with a similar to 70% increase in the percentage of time spent vigilant post-cheetah reintroduction. Springbok levels of vigilance were lower (similar to 50% increase), which we suggest is a function of body-size and/or grouping behaviour. Importantly, we showthat naive prey species are able to exhibit a rapid response to the reintroduction of large carnivores. However, the variation in responses highlights the importance of species-level monitoring after large carnivore reintroductions.

AB  - Ecologists and evolutionary biologists have revealed that adaptive microevolution (i.e., allele frequency changes through time) and behavioral changes occur rapidly enough to affect contemporary ecological dynamics, and we can consider rapid adaptation for better conservation and management of wild populations. However, previous studies tended to focus on adaptation that increases population densities (e.g., evolutionary rescue), and did not pay attention to adaptation that decreases population densities (e.g., evolutionary suicide). Here, we demonstrate that controlling trait adaptation may be potentially important for decreasing population densities. One possibility is introducing "selfish" genotypes to populations. If the genotypes increase their reproductive success at the expense of population growth (e.g., cheaters in subsocial ants or coercive males in damselflies), we can decrease population densities (intraspecific adaptation load). The other possible option is diverting trait values of animals from the value that maximizes population growth (ecological trap). For example, we may be able to change behavior of a deer population by hunting so that they will not approach the best habitat with ample resources (landscape of fear). Then, we can consider the optimal allocation of our effort to directly decrease their population densities and control their trait values. However, we should carefully conduct controlling trait adaptation because it may result in unintended outcomes through modified genetic compositions and behaviors, such as increasing genetic variation of the focal population that enhances adaptation to changing environments by introducing selfish genotypes or a transient increase of population densities by modified behaviors.

AB  - Okapi (Okapia johnstoni) belong to the Giraffidae family and is the only representative of the Okapia genus. The species has been declared as endangered and due to its very elusive nature, little is known about its reproductive behavior. The wild population has continued to decrease over the last decades despite the different conservation programs developed worldwide. Captive breeding is difficult and the European population is not self-sustaining. An alternative tool to prevent the extinction of this charismatic species is the use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Specifically, we introduce a novel protocol for the in vitro maturation (IVM) and cryopreservation of matured oocytes obtained post-mortem. Out of sixteen cumulus-oocytes complexes isolated from one deceased individual, four matured metaphase II (MII) oocytes were successfully obtained following IVM. Furthermore, these matured oocytes demonstrated resilience during the vitrification/warming process and underwent sperm injection. Although no embryos were obtained, this study represents the first step towards the application of ART in okapi, providing a foundation for future reproductive interventions aimed at preserving self-sustaining captive populations.

AB  - Flores represents a unique insular environment with an extensive record of Pleistocene fossil remains and stone artefacts. In the So'a Basin of central Flores these include endemic Stegodon, Komodo dragons, giant tortoises, rats, birds and hominins, and lithic artefacts that can be traced back to at least one million years ago (1 Ma). This comprehensive review presents important new data regarding the dating and faunal sequence of the So'a Basin, including the site of Mata Menge where Homo floresiensis-like fossils dating to approximately 0.7 Ma were discovered in 2014. By chemical fingerprinting key silicic tephra originating from local and distal eruptive sources we have now established basin-wide tephrostrati-graphic correlations, and, together with new numerical ages, present an update of the chronostratig-raphy of the So'a Basin, with major implications for the faunal sequence. These results show that a giant tortoise and the diminutive proboscidean Stegodon sondaari last occurred at the site of Tangi Talo-1.3 Ma, and not 0.9 Ma as previously thought. We also present new data suggesting that the disap-pearance of giant tortoise and S. sondaari from the sedimentary record occurred before, and/or was coincident with, the earliest hominin arrival, as evidenced by the first records of lithic artefacts occurring directly below the 1 Ma Wolo Sege Tephra. Artefacts become common in the younger layers, associated with a distinct fauna characterized by the medium-sized Stegodon florensis and giant rat Hooijeromys nusatenggara. Furthermore, we describe a newly discovered terrace fill, which extends the faunal record of Stegodon in the So'a Basin to the Late Pleistocene. Our evidence also suggests that the paleoenvir-onment of the So'a Basin became drier around the time of the observed faunal transition and arrival of hominins on the island, which could be related to an astronomically-forced climate response at the onset of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT;-1.25 Ma) leading to increased aridity and monsoonal intensity.

AB  - High pathogenicity island (HPI), a critical genomic element of pathogenic Yersiniabactin (Ybt) carries out synthesis, regulation, transportation as well as virulence. As a virulent determinant for the E. coli, the role of HPI in Saba pig was explored to provide some perspective about disease association. This is the first study in which 44 E. coli superior serotype strains were isolated and identified from Yunnan Saba pigs. The genomic DNA of all isolated superior serotypes of E. coli was obtained. Five major high pathogenicity island (HPI) structural genes (irp1, irp2, irp3, irp4 and irp5) were cloned, sequenced and referenced with GenBank database. The sequence identities of irp1, irp2, irp3, irp4 and irp5 with GenBank were 98 %, 99 %, 99 %, 98 %, and 99 %, respectively. Forty-four E. coli isolates characterized similarity with enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), Y. pestis and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). The secondary and tertiary structures of high molecular weight proteins (HMWPs), encoded by five structural genes, were predicted using bioinformatics tools. These proteins had differences in random curls, alpha-helix and slight amount of beta-sheet. After validation, 10 iron deficient isolates expressed the ferritin HMWPs similar to those of Yersinia. Later on, Kunming mice were infected with E. coli HPI+ and HPI- strains, respectively for the histopathology examination. The higher organ damage was observed by E. coli HPI+ than HPI- strain in mice. This study postulates the predicted protein structures of major genes, and validates the HMWP expression under iron starvation and provides a theoretical basis for prevention and treatment of E. coli related diseases.

AB  - Invasions by insects that become pests are an increasing problem for agriculture. Introductions of parasitoids from the regions of pest origin and breeding plants resistant to invasive pests can reduce the abundances and impacts of pests, while providing safe, sustainable alternatives to insecticides. However, impacts of parasitoids and plant resistance are likely to interact, and the abiotic environment, and in particular, climate change is likely to affect these interactions. Here I report results from simulations with mathematical models of population dynamics of aphids and parasitoids on resistant versus susceptible plants, parameterized with published results, designed to test the following hypotheses: (1) parasitoids can reduce abundances and frequencies of virulent aphids able to overcome plant resistance, (2) temperature regime affects the impacts of parasitoids on virulent aphids, and (3) the outcomes of these interactions vary with crop. Two systems were modeled: the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, on soybean, and the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noeia, on wheat. The parasitoids in the models are in the genus Aphelinus, species of which have a long association with biological control of invasive pests. In the simulations with these models, parasitoids reduced the abundances, and on wheat, the percent of virulent aphids. The impacts of parasitoids on virulent aphids were greater in southern locations than in northern locations, and the impacts on virulent aphids were greater on wheat than on soybean. Indeed, parasitoids actually increased the frequencies of virulent aphids on soybean when only susceptible plants were present, while reducing the abundance of all aphids. If one accepts that comparisons of population dynamics in southern versus northern locations indicate the likely affects of climate change in the northern locations, these results suggest that climate change would lead to decreased abundance and frequency of virulent aphids in northern locations.

AB  - In the eastern North Pacific, the Guadalupe Island Biosphere Reserve (GIBR) is one of the most renowned white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) aggregation sites studied to date, and an important tourism activity has been developed in the reserve. This study used tourist-based cage diving activities to biologically monitor white sharks from 2014 to 2019 within the GIBR. The data indicated a gradual increase in the overall abundance of white sharks with an age-structure shift, as young of the year and juvenile sharks were more prevalent during the latter part of the study period (2016-2019). The arrival of young of the year and juvenile white sharks coincided with regional changes in oceanographic conditions off California and Baja California. The arrival of adult female white sharks coincided with the seasonal peak in elephant seal abundance. Records of high-risk white shark behaviours, a shift to sharks of younger ages, and the high prevalence of small individuals during cage diving activities supports the need for the continued revision of tourism operational protocols. This study highlights the importance of white shark biological monitoring to identify threats and challenges to the growing tourism industry and the management of the species in Guadalupe Island and in other aggregation sites.

AB  - While termites play important ecological roles, a fraction of species have strong invasive capabilities and represent urban pests of economic importance worldwide. Their invasive potential is exacerbated by human activities such as maritime transport, with privately owned boats serving as key vectors for local and global termite dispersal, particularly for Cryptotermes and Coptotermes pest species. Land establishment by invasive termites can remain undetected for decades, often making eradication attempts too late to succeed. Ultimately, invasive termite species will likely continue to spread at the global scale, and recent new invasive records point toward an underestimation of their actual current invasive status.

AB  - Each year temporary puddles are formed on compacted earth roads as a consequence of heavy rains and subsequent flooding in the large floodplain forests of the Danube River, Hungary, Central Europe, Hungary. After the receding of floodwaters, the muddy puddles persist from spring to mid-fall, where they are densely populated by Galba truncatula snails on an annual basis. These snails are the sole intermediate host of Fascioloides magna liver fluke of deer in the forest. According to field observations, G. truncatula is a very rare species on banks of river branches and lakes within the forest but always appears in large aggregations in these semi-natural potholes. Red deer (Cervus elaphus) leave their droppings in puddles while they wallow in the mud, therefore the snails encounter the miracidia of F. magna frequently. Snails are not able to dig themselves into the tamp soil of roads therefore they are destroyed by the wheels of vehicles which drive down the roads from autumn to the end of winter. Therefore, snails colonize these puddles regularly every spring. Since there is no connection between the distant puddles, it is supposed that deer and wild boars repeatedly introduce the snails into the puddles each year carrying snails with the help of mud, which is stuck on their fur while they wallow. This method of transport is supported by the fact that shell remnants of snails can be found on the bark of rubbing trunks situated nearby wallows. It seems that the sequential creation of wallow sites and the repeated introduction of G. truncatula enhance the likelihood for the trematode to infect both hosts.

   The pygmy hog is one of the world's rarest suids and classified as an endangered species. Efforts are being made to breed them in captivity and reintroduce them into the wild. In this study, we examined reproductive hormones in captive pygmy hogs using a non-invasive method by collecting 785 fecal samples from five females and two males for 12 months. High-pressure liquid chromatography was performed to examine the presence of immunoreactive progesterone and testosterone metabolites in the fecal samples. We standardized and validated enzyme immunoassays (EIA) for fecal progesterone and testosterone metabolites. Using progesterone EIA, we were able to detect pregnancies in four females and estimate the relevant gestation period. We also recorded 172 births from the captive breeding center and found strong seasonality patterns in births. In males, fecal testosterone metabolite concentrations were higher in the breeding season than in the non-breeding season as evidenced by elevated testosterone concentrations during breeding season. A significant difference in fecal progesterone metabolites concentration was observed between non-pregnant and pregnant females. This study can directly help in monitoring the reproductive status of reintroduced hogs both in the wild and in conservation breeding programs in India and elsewhere.
   The pygmy hog (Porcula salvania), until recently was classified as a critically endangered suid facing the threat of extinction due to habitat degradation. Efforts are being made to protect the pygmy hog from extinction and breed them in captivity under the Pygmy Hog Conservation Programme (PHCP). However, very little information is available on the reproductive physiology of pygmy hogs. Therefore, the present study aims to standardize enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for monitoring pregnancy and reproductive status using progesterone and testosterone metabolites. A total of 785 fecal samples were collected from five females and two males over a period of one year from the PHCP Research and Breeding Centre, Guwahati, Assam. High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed the presence of immunoreactive progesterone and testosterone metabolites in feces. Mating was observed in all five females, and four of them gave birth successfully. We were able to detect pregnancy using fecal progesterone metabolites. The mean gestation period, based on mating and parturition, was estimated to be 153.25 days from the four females studied. The breeding center recorded 172 births between 1996 and 2000 and found strong seasonal patterns in the birth rate, with most of the births occurring between May and June. In the males, fecal testosterone metabolites were significantly higher in the breeding season than in the non-breeding season. This is the first study on the subject and will help with future breeding programs in other captive breeding centers and with reproductive monitoring of reintroduced populations.

AB  - The West Kalimantan province in Borneo island, Indonesia belongs to endemic area of Japanese encephalitis (JE) that accounts for approximately 30% of total cases yearly. As the presence of pig holdings is uncommon in West Kalimantan, another reservoir host might have played a role in the local transmission of JE virus in this area. Current study aimed to identify the potential role of bats in the local transmission of JE by performing molecular detection of JE virus in bats and mosquitoes using RT-PCR. Sample collection was performed in 3 districts in West Kalimantan, covering 3 different ecosystems: forest, coastal, and residential areas. Bat collection was performed using mist net and harp net, while mosquito collection was carried out using animal-baited trap and human landing collection. A total of 373 blood samples from bats were tested for JE virus, among which 21 samples (5.6%) showed positive results, mainly from Cynopterus brachyotis (lesser short-nosed fruit bat) found in residential areas. Out of 53 mosquito pools, 3 JE-positive pools of Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. vishnui were collected at the same location as JE-positive bats. Current study showed the first evidence of JE virus detection in several species of Megachiropteran bats in Indonesia, demonstrated the potential role of frugivorous bats in local transmission of JE in West Kalimantan. More aggressive measures are required in JE risk mitigation, particularly in initiating JE vaccination campaign and in avoiding disruption of bats' natural habitats through changes in land-use.

AB  - Nothofagus (southern beech) species form a major component of southern hemisphere forests, and in many regions are becoming an important focus for restoration efforts. However, restoration projects are predominantly carried out at small, local scales using a wide range of different techniques that have produced mixed results. In order to improve outcomes and develop general strategies for southern beech restoration, we review and compare data from previous trials to determine what techniques have been scientifically tested, identify the most effective methods, and pinpoint gaps in current practices. We assessed the effects of restoration techniques, applied in 91 trials from 22 publications across the southern hemisphere, on seedling survival and growth. Providing shelter improved both seedling survival and growth, controlling weeds improved survival, and protecting from herbivores improved seedling growth. Despite being one of the most commonly applied techniques, fertilizer application only marginally improved seedling survival and did not significantly influence seedling growth. Other techniques, such as increasing glasshouse container size or growth time or manipulating soil before planting, showed mixed results. Surprisingly, no trials examined the use of ectomycorrhizal fungal inoculum as a restoration technique. We discuss the outcomes of this review in the context of our current understanding of southern beech regeneration ecology, to inform future Nothofagus restoration practices and suggest where future research should be directed.

AB  - Urbanization, with the acceleration of construction operations in cities, is the main reason for in-creasing the absorption of thermal energy in urban areas, which leads to climate change, especially urban form has responded differently depending on environmental dimension of urban context concerning the urban heat island intensity. In the last Studies, Researchers have not Codified the effect of urban form on heat islands in the form of a comprehensive model. It is necessary to examine each urban context according to its own conditions. Accordingly, this study aims to identify the effect of building form variability on reducing the intensity of heat islands in Ferdous context of Tabriz in the form of comprehensive modelling as a new task. The research gap is the effect of the form of buildings on the intensity of UHI, and the question will be asked whether it is possible to control the intensity of UHI by changing the form by influencing the climatic indicators. Our conceptual framework was based on urban form typologies in microscale affect the amount of energy intake and consumption, especially the intensity of heat islands, and whether the use of desirable types can be responsive to reducing the intensity of these islands? In this regard, using a quantitative analysis method in Rhinoceros software, especially using Grasshopper plugins, urban form is investigated. This analysis includes both the coldest and hottest days of the year. The results show that the optimal model is the cross typology.

AB  - Home-range estimates are a common product of animal tracking data, as each range represents the area needed by a given individual. Population-level inference of home-range areas-where multiple individual home ranges are considered to be sampled from a population-is also important to evaluate changes over time, space or covariates such as habitat quality or fragmentation, and for comparative analyses of species averages. Population-level home-range parameters have traditionally been estimated by first assuming that the input tracking data were sampled independently when calculating home ranges via conventional kernel density estimation (KDE) or minimal convex polygon (MCP) methods, and then assuming that those individual home ranges were measured exactly when calculating the population-level estimates. This conventional approach does not account for the temporal autocorrelation that is inherent in modern tracking data, nor for the uncertainties of each individual home-range estimate, which are often large and heterogeneous. Here, we introduce a statistically and computationally efficient framework for the population-level analysis of home-range areas, based on autocorrelated kernel density estimation (AKDE), that can account for variable temporal autocorrelation and estimation uncertainty. We apply our method to empirical examples on lowland tapir Tapirus terrestris, kinkajou Potos flavus, white-nosed coati Nasua narica, white-faced capuchin monkey Cebus capucinus and spider monkey Ateles geoffroyi, and quantify differences between species, environments and sexes. Our approach allows researchers to more accurately compare different populations with different movement behaviours or sampling schedules while retaining statistical precision and power when individual home-range uncertainties vary. Finally, we emphasize the estimation of effect sizes when comparing populations, rather than mere significance tests.

AB  - Simple Summary This study investigated the genetic attributes of the Jiangshan black pig conservation population, with a specific focus on genetic diversity, family structure, and levels of inbreeding. The results provide significant insights for the management and conservation of a pig population with limited numbers. The study proposes the use of genomic data by breeders to improve breeding practices, especially by taking into account familial relationships. Suggestions include maintaining an equitable distribution of male and female pigs within each family and choosing individuals with a kinship coefficient lower than 0.1 for breeding purposes.Abstract The Jiangshan black pig is an indigenous pig breed in China, renowned for its superior meat quality and adaptability to roughage. However, the population of Jiangshan black pigs has dwindled due to the introduction of cosmopolitan pig breeds and the outbreak of African swine fever, putting them at risk of extinction. To offer insights into the conservation and breeding of Jiangshan black pigs, this study involved 118 Jiangshan black pigs as the research subjects and employed the Zhongxin-1 Porcine Breeding Array PLUS chip to detect whole-genome SNPs. Additionally, various software tools were utilized to accurately analyze the genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationship, inbreeding coefficient, and pedigree structure of the Jiangshan black pig conservation population. The findings indicated that the effective population size (Ne) of the Jiangshan black pig was 4.9, with an average inbreeding coefficient of 0.253 within the population. A genetic relationship analysis identified that the 16 male pigs were clustered into four families, and the 100 female pigs were also assigned to these familial groups. Furthermore, two female pigs were classified as "other" due to their distant genetic relatedness to all the males. These results contribute to a better understanding of the current status of the conservation of the Jiangshan black pig population and offer a theoretical foundation for the development of conservation strategies.

AB  - Aims Plants can influence the level of herbivory experienced by neighboring plants. The importance of such belowground associational effects are poorly understood. In this study we examine whether Jacobaea vulgaris provides associational resistance against nematodes to neighboring plants. Methods Thirteen species (6 forbs, 3 grasses and 4 legumes) were each grown in mixtures with J. vulgaris and in monocultures. A nematode community was introduced to half of the pots. After 12 weeks, plant dry mass was assessed for each individual plant in each pot, and the number of nematodes in the soil and roots were identified. We then examined for each plant species its performance in mixtures and in monocultures, in presence and absence of nematodes and analyzed the abundance and composition of nematodes. Results Forbs produced more, grasses similar, and legumes less biomass in mixtures with J. vulgaris than in monocultures. Nematode addition did not influence biomass. There were fewer root-feeding nematodes in the soil in mixtures than in monocultures, but this was only true for plants that were good hosts for nematodes. The community composition of soil nematodes was different in monocultures and mixtures. Densities of migratory endoparasitic nematodes in the roots of neighboring plants were lower in mixtures than in monocultures. Moreover, the presence of nematodes changed the outcome of plant-plant interactions, often in favor of J. vulgaris. Conclusions Jacobaea vulgaris provides belowground associational resistance to other plants against migratory endoparasitic nematodes, and the presence of nematodes can change the outcome of plant-plant interactions.

AB  - Simple Summary: Wolves are known for their cooperative hunting behaviour, which has been thoroughly studied. On the contrary, little is known about lone wolves' hunting strategies. Between 2017 and 2019, we monitored a lone male wolf living in a Mediterranean coastal area. The wolf settled in a protected estate where both wild and domestic ungulates were available as potential prey. His predatory behaviour was recorded through a combination of camera trapping and active search for kill sites and prey carcasses. Features of kill sites were modelled to test for selection by the wolf. The main prey resulted to be fallow deer. The wolf avoided dense habitats to hunt and usually attacked his prey in open areas where the presence of fences could support him in constraining and successfully killing deer. The prey body condition, estimated as the percentage of fat content in the bone marrow of hind legs, was above the average of the population, suggesting a high efficacy for the lone wolf hunting strategy but also the adoption of a high-risk feeding strategy by deer.
   The aim of the study was to assess which kill site characteristics were selected by a lone wolf living in a protected Mediterranean coastal area near the city of Pisa, Italy, where both wild and domestic ungulates were available as potential prey. Between 2017 and 2019, we monitored the wolf's predatory behaviour through a combination of camera trapping and active search for kill sites and prey carcasses. The main prey found was the fallow deer (n = 82); only two wild boars and no domestic ungulates were found preyed upon. The features and habitat of kill sites were modelled to test for selection by the wolf. The habitat type of kill site was composed of meadows and pastures (89.3%), woods (7.3%), degraded coastal areas (1.9%), roads and rivers (1.1%), and marshes (0.5%). We calculated their distance from landscape features and ran a binomial generalised linear model to test the influence of such landscape variables. The distance of kill sites from landscape elements was significantly different from random control sites, and a positive selection for fences was found. In fact, the wolf pushed fallow deer towards a fence to constrain them and prevent them from escaping. We also analysed the body condition of predated fallow deer as a percentage of fat content in the bone marrow of the hind legs. Our results revealed the selection of the lone wolf for deer in good body condition. This is a possible outcome of the habitat selection shown by fallow deer in the study area, where fenced open pastures are the richest in trophic resources; therefore, our findings suggest a high efficacy for the lone wolf hunting strategy, but also the adoption of a high risk feeding strategy by deer. This study suggests that a lone predator can take advantage of human infrastructures to maximise its predatory effectiveness.

AB  - Introduction: Agriculture predominantly follows three farming systems: natural, organic (organic manures for soil nutrition), and agrochemical intensive. Agrochemical-intensive farming uses synthetic fertilizers, insecticides, pesticides, and weedicides. It holds the most prominent place in the modern agriculture business. Humankind realizes that over-reliance on synthetic agrochemicals has resulted in the declining health of the ecosystem's soil, water, and living species. It must explore strategies to reduce synthetic agrochemicals without compromising agricultural production to restore the ecological balance. Nano-formulations help lower dosages of agrochemicals, leading to the emergence of nano-agriculture. However, the critical challenge is how we could exploit nanomaterials' power to selectively improve crop plants' metabolic performance so that it has a better competitive edge in the field to withstand the nutrient-seeking pressure exerted by other plants. Methods: Here we have achieved the same by root treatment of the onion crop and then growing them in the presence of organic goat manure. Results: In a 2 years field trial with onion crops, we report an increase in yield through root treatment with nano-pyrite (FeS2) plus soil application of goat dropping (Test) as compared to the use of goat dropping alone (Control). In the first-year field trial (November 2018- April 2019), the total biomass (bulb + leaf) weight of the test sample was 4.75 kg (n = 86), while control samples weighed 3.5 kg (n = 83). The total bulb weight for the control and test was 2.6 and 3.6 kg, respectively. In the second-year field trial (December 2019- April 2020), the total biomass of the test sample was 2.65 kg (n = 64), while control samples weighed 2.30 kg (n = 64). We observed a yield-boosting effect of root treatment with nano-pyrite plus soil application of goat dropping in onion crops. As monitored by spectroscopic absorbance, there is a significant increase in the anthocyanin content in test bulbs (0.069) compared to control bulbs (0.02). Similarly, the relative flavanol content in test leaves (0.253) was significantly higher compared to the control samples (0.086). We have integrated nano-agriculture and organic farming, resulting in a hybrid form; nano-organic farming bolsters the metabolic fitness of the onion (Allium cepa) to achieve sustainable food production.

AB  - Feeding activities by fishes are among the key ecological processes that sustain coral reef functioning. Those trophic-based processes are known to vary across space and across seasons or years. However, there is still little knowledge about their variability within and between days as well as whether these processes are dominated by the same species across time. Using remote underwater cameras, we quantified rates of three feeding activities (corallivory, herbivory and invertivory) for three one-hour time slots (morning, midday, afternoon) over two days on two coral reefs around Mayotte Island (Western Indian Ocean). Feeding activities were highly variable at within and between-day scales and concentrated in a few pulses. Herbivory was the highest in the afternoon which aligns with previous findings regarding activity of herbivorous fishes. Corallivory was the highest in the morning, which highlights the advantage of long-duration benthic remote underwater videos to accurately assess all trophic activities. Trophic-related processes were dominated by the same few species in both sites and across time of the day. This study pinpoints the importance of including within-day and between-day variations when studying ecological processes, as neglecting these variations may introduce biases into our understanding of these processes.

AB  - Introduction. As a main consumer of energy, the brain is particularly susceptible to the effects of hypoxia. However, during long-term evolution, the brain of the plateau yak developed adaptive mechanisms enabling it to maintain normal physiological conditions. Material and methods. A total of 20 male yaks belonging to two age groups [newborns (1-6 days old; n = 10) and adults (3-5 years old; n = 10)] were obtained, and the brain tissue was fixed and processed by standard methods. RT-qPCR, ELISA and IHC assays were used to investigate the expression and localization of HIF1 alpha, BNIP3 and beclin-1 in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, medulla oblongata and cerebellum of newborn and adult yak brains and to explore their potential neuroprotective role. Results. We found that the expression levels of HIF1 alpha, BNIP3 and beclin-1 at the mRNA and protein levels varied in the different regions of yak brain, with the highest expression observed in the hippocampus, followed by the cerebral cortex, thalamus, medulla oblongata and the cerebellum. Moreover, the HIF1 alpha, BNIP3 and beclin-1 expression were significantly higher in the newborn yaks' brains than in the adult yak. The IHC results showed that HIF1 alpha, BNIP3 and beclin-1 were mainly distributed in the neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, medulla oblongata and cerebellum. In particular, HIF1 alpha accumulated in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Furthermore, the immunoreactivity of BNIP3 and beclin-1 was concentrated in the cytoplasm. Conclusions. The results indicate that the yak hippocampus and cerebral cortex may be more resistant to hypoxia than thalamus, medulla oblongata and cerebellum, and the expression of BNIP3 and beclin-1 may be regulated by HIF1 alpha to serve a neuroprotective role in the yak's brain to adaptation to hypoxia. Additionally, the brain of adult yaks may have a higher tolerance to hypoxia than the brain of newborn yaks. (Folia Histochemica et Cytobiologica 2023, Vol. 61, No. 1, 26-33)

AB  - Providing shade in situ in paddocks may lead to better animal welfare and/or improved sheep production outcomes. However, there are no replicated experiments detailing the effect of the provision of shade in situ under grazing during summer on behavioral, physiological, and production outcomes of sheep in the sci-entific literature. This study uses a replicated field experiment to examine the effect of provision of shade in situ to sheep under grazing on animal behavior, respiration rate, core body temperature (CBT), growth, and immunological function during summer in south east Australia. The experiment consisted of eight un-shaded pasture plots and eight shaded pasture plots with an 18 m2 shade structure. Each plot was stocked with 20 sheep. Sheep with access to shade chose to use the shade in the hottest part of the day, reducing their 12 pm respiration rate to 64 breaths per minute (bpm) compared with sheep without shade at 98 bpm (P < 0.0001). However, the provision of shade had no effect on CBT, immunological function, or animal production. In the hottest part of the day, sheep without shade exhibited shade seeking behavior by either being located along the fence line (P < 0.0001) or at the water trough (P < 0.001). In conclusion, provision of shade in situ to sheep under grazing during summer conditions improved the affective state, and thus welfare, of the sheep by reducing the respiration rate needed to maintain thermostability.Crown Copyright & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Domestic mammals may become invasive alien species when introduced within natural environments and when they establish reproductive populations. One of the most common pathways of species introduction is represented by intentional or accidental escapes from confined environments, including zoos, farms and enclosures. A feral population of llama Lama glama has been present in Central Italy since 2016 after escaping from a zoological garden. In 2020, only three individuals were confirmed to be still present within a 40-hectare area, following a field survey. We carried out questionnaires with the resident human population to determine the local perception and the acceptance of two possible management actions, i.e., direct killing and surgical sterilization. Llamas are quite docile domestic animals, thus local perception was, in general, very positive and also linked to the exotic origin of the species, making llamas a welcome observation and a pleasant surprise. The observed decline of this population may be due to predation by wolves and poaching, together with the lack of suitability of natural environment, which may have prevented llamas establishing an invasive population. In this context, however, individual removal action should be conducted before the population shows a demographic rebound.
   Since 2016, a feral population of llama Lama glama has been present in Central Italy after escaping from a zoological garden and starting to reproduce. We updated demographic status and distribution of this population and investigated societal perception towards the llama presence and management in the area through a standard questionnaire. Field data were collected through direct (transects traveled by car and on foot) and indirect (newspapers, social networks and online platforms) research. The feral population appears to be declining. In July 2020, the population was represented by three individuals (one male and two females), identified also through photoidentification, most likely located within a 40-hectare area. The majority of citizens are aware of the presence of feral llamas and show a positive attitude toward them and a negative one toward management actions. The case of feral llamas in Italy is an evident example of unsafe management of a species which should have kept in a zoo and which, once set free, was able to catalyze the attention of the general public. The decline of this population limits the need of drastic management actions that, given the appreciation expressed by people and press toward these animals, would have been at risk of conflict with the public opinion. Removal action should be rapidly taken, i.e., before any demographic rebound and before the population becomes a stable feature of the local landscape.

AB  - The waters near the Antarctic Peninsula have always been a study hot spot because of their variable and unique oceanographic conditions. To determine the distribution and possible influencing factors on phytoplankton size and abundance near the Antarctic Peninsula, a large-scale survey was conducted during the austral summer of 2018. Samples were collected in 27 stations located in the Drake Passage (DP), South Shetland Islands (SSI), and South Orkney Islands (SOI). Phytoplankton communities were described using chlorophyll a (Chl a), flow cytometry and light microscopy to cover a size range from pico- to microphytoplankton. Nanophytoplankton, especially small nanophytoplankton (2-6 mu m) with abundance ranging from 0.66 x 10(3) cells/mL to 8.46 x 10(3) cells/mL, was predominant throughout the study area. Among different regions, there was an obvious size shift. The proportion of picophytoplankton near the Elephant Island (EI) and DP was higher than other regions, and larger cells were found mainly in east of SOI. The distribution of phytoplankton abundance detected by flow cytometry was not completely consistent with Chl a concentrations due to the contribution of larger cells to Chl a. Possible influencing factors on the phytoplankton size distribution were discussed. The properties of water masses such as temperature and salinity can influence the phytoplankton size distribution. Correlation analysis revealed that only picophytoplankton is significantly correlated with salinity. Light and Fe availability might affect phytoplankton abundance and size distribution especially near the waters of SSI and EI in this study. It was also speculated that the abundance of cryptophytes is possibly related to ice melting.

AB  - Interspecies interactions present diverse forms and functions, contributing significantly to ecological and social dynamics. This study focuses on the mounting behaviours of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) towards Sika deer (Cervus nippon), a rare and still unexplained phenomenon, with minimal emphasis on the behaviour of the deer. Using video data from two distinct sites, Yakushima and Minoh, Japan, we documented 45 sequences of macaque-deer interactions and analysed macaques' behaviours and deer behaviours using focal and behavioural sampling techniques. We identified four primary activities performed by macaques during mountings-sexual, play, grooming, and resting-with resting being predominant. The study evaluates six hypotheses regarding the functions of these mounting behaviours: (1) interactions are sex-specific, (2) macaques use deer for transportation, (3) mutual warming through physical contact occurs, (4) deer provide support for resting, (5) macaques engage in grooming to consume parasites or play to strengthen interspecies bonds, and (6) aggressive signals relate to resource disputes or rejection of mounting behaviour. Statistical analyses using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn's post-hoc test revealed significant differences between resting and other active behaviours, but no significant differences in behaviour duration between lying and sitting positions. Adults engaged in mounting for longer periods than juveniles, suggesting potential age-related differences in social and reproductive roles. These findings enhance our understanding of interspecies interactions by focusing on macaque behaviours and emphasise the need for longitudinal studies to clarify the ecological and social implications of these interactions.

AB  - Simple Summary The rapidly growing wild boar population has resulted in an increasing rate of human-wildlife conflicts, including economic damage to crops or spreading African swine fever (ASF), which affects the pork industry. This situation necessitates the adoption of various measures to prevent wild boar movement, mitigate spreading of diseases, and protect crops. We evaluated the impact of commonly used odor fences (Wildschwein Stopp) using GPS telemetry of tagged individuals. The telemetry of free-ranging wild boars demonstrated no effect on their crossing of the odor fence lines compared to before the installation. Moreover, no difference was found when comparing the home range size of monitored individuals during the 22 days before and after odor fence installation. Therefore, our findings do not support using odor fences to prevent wild boar movement as a mitigation measure of ASF transmission or line protection against the damage caused by wild boars to crops.Abstract Wild boars are an opportunistic wildlife species that has successfully colonized the human-modified landscape in Europe. However, the current population boom has negative consequences, which result in a rapid increase in human-wildlife conflicts and disease transmission, including African swine fever (ASF). The increasing frequency of conflicts requires adequate solutions for these issues through various measures. Application of deterrents is a common non-lethal measure whose effects have been insufficiently verified until recently. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of odor fences, often applied as a barrier against wild boar movement. For this purpose, 18 wild boars were marked with GPS collars. After 22 days of initial monitoring, 12 sections of odor fences were installed on their home ranges. The monitored wild boars crossed the area 20.5 +/- 9.2 times during the pre-installation period and 19.9 +/- 8.4 times after the odor fence installation. Moreover, the average home range varied between 377.9 +/- 185.0 ha before and 378.1 +/- 142.2 ha after the odor fence installation. Based on GPS telemetry results, we do not support using odor repellent lines for crop protection or for limiting wild boar movement to lessen ASF outbreaks.

AB  - Simple Summary Recently, the risk of tick-borne diseases (TBD) has drawn increasing attention from a public health perspective. Information about where ticks are distributed is important for the prevention of TBDs. In this study, we used the MaxEnt model to predict the potential distribution of six major tick species out of 16 tick species collected in the Kanto region, the central part of Japan, based on land-use, climate, and wildlife distribution, and to investigate the factors that contribute to each distribution of ticks. The distribution of raccoons contributed to the distribution of five tick species, and forest connectivity was a strong contributor to the distribution of all species. Background: Tick distributions have changed rapidly with changes in human activity, land-use patterns, climate, and wildlife distributions over the last few decades. Methods: To estimate potential distributions of ticks, we conducted a tick survey at 134 locations in western Kanto, Japan. We estimated the potential distributions of six tick species (Amblyomma testudinarium Koch, 1844; Haemaphysalis flava Neumann, 1897; Haemaphysalis kitaokai Hoogstraal, 1969; Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann, 1901; Haemaphysalis megaspinosa Saito, 1969; and Ixodes ovatus Neumann, 1899) using MaxEnt modeling based on climate patterns, land-use patterns, and the distributions of five common wildlife species: sika deer (Cervus nippon Temminck, 1838), wild boar (Sus scrofa Linnaeus, 1758), raccoon (Procyon lotor Linnaeus, 1758), Japanese raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides Gray, 1834), and masked palm civet (Paguma larvata C.E.H. Smith, 1827)). Results: We collected 24,546 individuals of four genera and 16 tick species. Our models indicated that forest connectivity contributed to the distributions of six tick species and that raccoon distribution contributed to five tick species. Other than that, sika deer distribution contributed to H. kitaokai, and wild boar distribution, bamboo forest, and warm winter climate contributed specifically to A. testudinarium. Conclusions: Based on these results, the dispersal of some tick species toward residential areas and expanded distributions can be explained by the distribution of raccoons and by forest connectivity.

AB  - Trophic plasticity is an important factor in assessing the ability of a species to remain in an altered environment or its ability to be introduced into a new environment. The Nile tilapia is a species that has been illegally introduced for aquaculture purposes in the central portion of the Amazon. Its escape into the natural environment has occurred, and it is already possible to find specimens in streams around Manaus, capital of the state of Amazonas, Brazil. This study aimed to investigate the diet of Nile tilapia in the stream known as Cachoeira Alta do Tarum & atilde; (Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil), a small tributary of the Tarum & atilde;-a & ccedil;u river that has been affected by anthropogenic actions. To identify its feeding habit, 43 stomachs were analyzed according to their degree of repletion, frequency of occurrence of food items, volumetric method, and the food importance index. The species was identified as being detritivores with a tendency to herbivory. Plastic was identified in the diet of this species, which indicates generalist and opportunistic habits when inserted in habitats with a low supply of food.

AB  - Tikopia Island, a small and relatively isolated Polynesian Outlier in the Southeast Solomon Islands, supports a remarkably dense human population with minimal external support. Examining long-term trends in human land use on Tikopia through archaeological datasets spanning nearly 3000 years presents an opportunity to investigate pathways to long-term sustainability in a tropical island setting. Here, we trace nutrient dynamics across Tikopia's three pre-European contact phases (Kiki, Sinapupu, Tuakamali) via stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of commensal Pacific rat (Rattus exulans) and domestic pig (Sus scrofa) bone and tooth dentine collagen. Our results show a decline in delta N-15 values from the Kiki (c. 800 BC-AD 100) to Sinapupu (c. AD 100-1200) phases, consistent with long-term commensal isotope trends observed on other Polynesian islands. However, increased delta N-15 coupled with lower delta C-13 values in the Tuakamali Phase (c. AD 1200-1800) point to a later nutrient rejuvenation, likely tied to dramatic transformations in agriculture and land use at the Sinapupu-Tuakamali transition. This study offers new, quantifiable evidence for deep-time land and resource management decisions on Tikopia and subsequent impacts on island nutrient status and long-term sustainability.

However, most studies examine the impacts of ALAN on a single species or under high levels of artificial light that are infrequent or unrealistic in urban environments. We currently have little information on how low levels of artificial light emanating from urban skyglow affect plants and their interactions with herbivores. We examined how short-term, low levels of ALAN affect grass and insects, including growth rate, photosynthesis, and stomatal conductance in grass, and foraging behavior and survival in crickets. We compared growth and leaf-level gas exchange of Kentucky Bluegrass (Poa pratensis) under low-levels of ALAN (0.3 lux) and starlight conditions (0.001 lux). Furthermore, each light treatment was divided into treatments with and without house crickets (Acheta domesticus). Without crickets present, bluegrass grown under ALAN for three weeks grew taller than plants grown under natural night light levels. In the fourth week when crickets were introduced, grass height decreased resulting in no measurable effects of light treatment. There were no measurable differences in grass physiology among treatments. Our results indicate that low levels of light resulting from skyglow affect plant growth initially. However, with herbivory, the effects of ALAN on grass may be inconsequential. Gaining an understanding of how ALAN affects plant-insect interactions is critical to predicting the ecological and evolutionary consequences of anthropogenic light pollution.

AB  - Simple Summary Reintroductions are important tools to achieve the long-term conservation of endangered species; however, these projects are dangerous for translocated animals. Reintroduced animals face novel habitats where food availability and secure resting sites are unknown, and in this context, such animals likely engage in long exploratory movements. Furthermore, reintroductions can be dangerous for domestic and wild animals inhabiting the reintroduction site due to the potential risk of catching diseases carried by reintroduced animals. Our study aimed to evaluate the spatial behavior of reintroduced Corsican red deer in central-eastern Sardinia and, on the basis of the obtained results, build a species distribution model to forecast the expansion of reintroduced deer and plan future reintroduction projects. Furthermore, we evaluated the sanitary risk for domestic animals (sheep) linked to Bluetongue virus potentially carried by deer. Our results highlighted the great habitat suitability of central-eastern Sardinia for Corsican red deer. However, deer are healthy carriers of Bluetongue virus, as confirmed by health analyses we performed on captured animals in the source areas. Particular attention in reintroduction planning is needed to avoid any negative impacts on domestic or wild animals of conservation measures. The Corsican red deer is an endangered subspecies that needs artificial translocation projects to gain its complete recovery with the formation of viable, interconnected populations. Between 2007 and 2017, we performed two reintroduction projects in four sites in central-eastern Sardinia via tracking 32 deer by means of GPS/GSM radiotelemetry. On the basis of the obtained results, we built a species distribution model (SDM) using MaxEnt software, selecting 200 random points from the merged deer core areas as presence data. Furthermore, to evaluate the sanitary risk linked to artificial translocations, we analyzed deer positivity to Bluetongue virus (BTV) in the founder populations. The SDM showed a high deer capability to colonize central-eastern Sardinia, but it also showed the possibility of spreading BTV to domestic sheep because sanitary analyses confirmed the virus' presence in the founder populations. Our main conclusion was that reintroductions are effective tools for the long-term conservation of the Corsican red deer, as long as sanitary risks are minimized by means of sanitary monitoring of translocated deer.

AB  - Fire ecology has a long history of empirical investigation in rangelands. However, the science is inconclusive and incomplete, sparking increasing interest on how to advance the discipline. Here, we introduce a new framework for qualitatively and quantitatively understanding the ranges of variability in fire regimes typical of experimental investigations in rangeland fire science compared with the range of conditions that actually occurred during contemporary social-ecological times. We implement this framework for one of rangelands' most pyrogenic systemsdthe Great Plains of North America. We identify four social-ecological fire eras that have epitomized people's relationship with wildland fire in the Great Plains since the last glacial maxima. These cultural fire eras include the now-extinct coexistence era (indigenous fire use), the suppression era (extermination of wildland fire occurrence), the shadow era (localized prescribed burning groups), and the emerging wildfire era (resulting from wildland fire management failures, continued decoupling of human-fire ignitions, and global change). Our synthesis demonstrates that experimental fire conditions have not explored the types and ranges of variation in fire regime components responsible for shaping rangeland vegetationdnow, in the past, or into the future. Instead, scientific investigations have focused largely on controlling and minimizing sources of uncertainty and experimental variation, essentially eliminating ranges of variation that underpin the functioning of fire in modern social-ecological systems. Yet a series of scientific investigations exist that targeted a wider range of variability in fire regime components, leading to major advancements and the rejection of a number of long-standing rules of thumb in rangeland science and management. These include 1) the manipulation of fire return interval, 2) the pyric herbivory experiments, and 3) the extreme fire trials. We discuss the general philosophy shared among these studies, introduce scientific standards needed to avoid common pitfalls, and highlight opportunities to better understand how rangeland pattern and process correspond to critical ranges of variation in the humanfire relationship.

AB  - This study used catch/effort (CPUE) and length-frequency (L/F) data to evaluate the status of 26 fish species in the mangroves of the Dongzhaigang National Reserve, Hainan Province, China, sampled in 2009 (16 species), 2014 (18 species) and 2020 (15 species) using CPUE and the length-based Bayesian biomass (LBB) method. The CPUE, both in number and weight, was lower in 2009 than in 2014 and lower again in 2020, with the 2009 low attributed to pollution due to shrimp, pig and duck farming within the reserve. Of the 26 fish species assessed, four experienced a large reduction of length from 2009 to 2020, and nine exhibited a decline in the ratio of current biomass to biomass at carrying capacity (B/B-0), which is expressed as the 'biomass left'. This ratio was, for most species, below 0.5 in 2009, which suggests that overfishing occurred in 2009 and that it has since become worse. Thus, while the CPUE data provided ambiguous results, the L/F data analyzed by the LBB method demonstrated unambiguously that 'miniaturization' through overfishing is occurring among the exploited 26 fish species from the mangroves of the Dongzhaigang National Reserve. For the fisheries in the mangals of Dongzhaigang Bay to remain viable, fishing effort should be reduced by local governments working with the affected communities, just as they reduced pollution a decade ago.

AB  - Microhaplotypes are small linked genomic regions comprising two or more single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are being applied in forensics and are emerging in wildlife monitoring studies and genomic epidemiology. Typically, targeted in non-coding regions, microhaplotypes in exonic regions can be designed with larger amplicons to capture functional non-synonymous sites and minimise insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms. Quality control is an important first step for high-confidence genotyping to counteract such false-positive variants. As genetic markers with higher polymorphism compared to biallelic SNPs, it is critical to ensure sequencing errors across the microhaplotype amplicon are filtered out to avoid introducing false-haplotypes. We developed the MhGeneS pipeline which works in tandem with Seq2Sat to help validate microhaplotype genotyping of the coding region of genes, with broader applicability to any microhaplotype profiling. We genotyped microhaplotype regions of the Zfx (congruent to 160 bp) and Zfy (congruent to 140 bp) genes, as well as an exon of the prion protein (Prnp) gene (congruent to 370 bp) in caribou (Rangifer tarandus) using paired-end Illumina technology. As important quality metrics affecting microhaplotype calling, we identified the sequencing error rate profile related to the overlap or non-overlap of paired-end reads as well as the read depth as significant. In the case of Prnp, we achieved confident microhaplotype calling through MhGeneS by removing small sections of the 5 ' and 3 ' amplicons and using a minimum read depth of 20. Read depth and sequence trimming may be locus-specific, and validation of these parameters is recommended before the high-throughput profiling of samples.

AB  - Male goats stimulated by the "male-to-male effect" for one month and then introduced to anestrous does are as efficient as those stimulated by photoperiod in inducing cyclicity in anestrous does. Here, we determined whether the sexually active (SA) male goats can stimulate reproduction in does and males when housed together in the same flock during the non-breeding season, and whether male goats exposed to the "male-to-male effect" can fertilize does with the same efficiency and timeframe as SA males stimulated by photoperiod. In March, one group of does was kept isolated from male goats, while three other groups were housed with seasonally hypoactive males (SH). In April, the isolated group was joined with two SA male goats (SA group), while the other three groups were managed as follows: one group was joined with two SA male goats (SA + SH group); the second group was joined with two SA male goats which were fitted with aprons to prevent mating (SA-apron + SH group); and the third group was joined with two SH male goats (SH + SH group). The percentages of does that kidded did not differ among SA (73 %), SA + SH (70 %) and SA-apron + SH (76)% groups; however, all three had greater kidding rates than the SH + SH group (29 %). We conclude that SA male goats stimulate the reproductive activity in both does and male goats during non-breeding season when housed together in the same group. Furthermore, male goats stimulated by the "male-to-male effect" can achieve fertility rates and fertilization timeframe comparable to those of SA male goats.

AB  - Simple Summary Analysis of 474 human casualties in wildlife-vehicle accidents (WVAs) in Lithuania between 2002 and 2022 revealed that their numbers have been escalating since 2018. Moose were the primary contributors to fatalities and injuries despite their much lower abundance in the country compared to that of roe deer. Temporal patterns showed that most casualties occurred during dusk or dawn in May and September, on weekends, and between 20:00 and 22:00. Spatially, main roads with high traffic density had the highest casualties per unit length. Most casualties occurred after vehicles directly hit an animal with cars and motorcycles being the most vulnerable. The effectiveness of WVA prevention measures was inconclusive with a small percentage of casualties occurring in areas with warning signs or fenced road segments. These findings highlight the need for a critical evaluation of current prevention strategies to reduce human casualties in WVAs.Abstract We analyzed 474 human casualties in wildlife-vehicle accidents (WVAs) that occurred between 2002 and 2022 in Lithuania, which is a small northern European country. The study revealed the escalating trend of WVAs, since 2018 surpassing other transport accidents, although the number of casualties per WVA was ca. 100 times lower compared to other transport accidents. Moose was the primary contributor, responsible for 66.7% of fatalities and 47.2% of injuries, despite much lower species abundance compared to roe deer, which is the main species involved in WVAs without human casualties. Temporal patterns highlighted seasonal, daily, and hourly variations, with the majority of casualties occurring during dusk or dawn in May and September, on weekends, and between 20:00 and 22:00. Spatially, main roads with high traffic density exhibited the highest casualties per unit length. Most casualties occurred after hitting an animal directly with cars and motorcycles being most vulnerable vehicles. The effectiveness of WVA prevention measures was inconclusive: 9.5% of fatalities and 1.4% of injuries were registered in the area of the warning sign, and 10.4% of all casualties occurred on fenced road segments. These findings suggest the need for a critical evaluation of the current prevention strategies in reducing human casualties associated with WVAs.

AB  - . Over several decades, air temperature and sea surface temperature (SST) have increased in the northeastern Pacific, as has the frequency of large-scale warm anomalies in SST. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of these warm anomalies on the production of northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris; NES) pups from the colony of the San Benito Archipelago, located in the central-western region of the Baja California Peninsula. Pup and adult female counts from the 2002 to 2019 breeding seasons were compiled to determine the trend in the abundance of the colony and its current state. In addition, birth rate variations during the study period were assessed. Likewise, the presence of warm anomaly events in the SST in the potential foraging area of adult females (PFA) was analyzed. The San Benito colony decreased at an average annual rate of 3.6% from 2002 to 2019, with an estimated abundance of 4,723 individuals (95% CI: 3,821-5,615) in 2019. However, the birth rate remained constant (mean 0.68 & PLUSMN; 0.08), even though several warm anomaly events associated with El Nino and The Blob phenomena were detected in the PFA. Our results suggest that large-scale warm anomalies in the SST do not severely impact NES pup production, thus the decline of the San Benito colony since the late 1900s could be due to other environmental factors, such as the increase in air temperature associated with climate change.

AB  - Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating of bulk sediments obtained from the alpine Blue Lake, located in the Snowy Mountains of southeastern Australia, was applied here to date recent lacustrine sediments. In addition, the presence of Pinus pollen (a taxon introduced in Australia about 150 years ago) down to a sediment depth of 56 cm in the core is used to obtain a chronology for the upper part of the core. Accelerated Mass Spectrometry radiocarbon dates obtained from organic muds from the same core do not agree with the chronology constructed using the three other dating techniques. In addition, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of single quartz grains, from sediment-core samples collected from the same lake, was applied to date recent lacustrine sediments. The optical age of 185 +/- 20 years for a sample at 60-62 cm depth, and 470 +/- 50 years at 116-118 cm depth are well over 1000 years younger than the ages inferred from radiocarbon dates. We therefore infer that the 'old' radiocarbon ages result from carbon stored for considerable time within the catchment prior to its transport and deposition on the lake floor. As plant decomposition occurs at much slower rates in high altitude environments, these results bring into question the veracity of previously published radiocarbon dates from Blue Lake and alpine lake sediments in general. The deposition ages inferred from the Pb-210-Cs-137 and OSL dating, and the first appearance of Pinus pollen, indicate that for the 100-year period after European settlement (from the mid 1800s to early 1900s) the sediment-accumulation rate increased by a factor of about 2, from 0.19 +/- 0.01 cm yr(-1) to 0.35 +/- 0.02 cm yr(-1). In the 1900s the accumulation rate increased further to 0.60 cm yr(-1). The accumulation rate was particularly rapid in the 20-year period from 1940-1960, reaching a rate 18 times higher than the pre-European rate in the mid-1950s. The increase in sedimentation rate is attributed to changes in land use resulting from European activities in the lake catchment, primarily through sheep and cattle grazing in the Blue Lake catchment.

AB  - The nutritional variations of food plants play a significant role in the health and population dynamics of wildlife. The body conditions of vulnerable greater one-horned (GOH) rhinoceros ( Rhinoceros unicornis) in Manas National Park (MNP), Assam, India deteriorate noticeably during the late monsoon to winter, and improve after routine grassland burning, when rhinos feed on the newly emerged leaves and young shoots of grasses. To investigate this, we analysed the nutritional parameters of the leaves of five grass species preferred by rhinos, including three tall grasses ( Saccharum spontaneum, S.narenga and Imperata cylindrica) and two short grasses ( Cynodon dactylon and Axonopus compressus), before and after grassland burning. Leaf samples were collected in triplicate from five different sites in MNP before (September) and after (March) grassland burning. Biochemical analyses showed the highest crude protein content in S. narenga before and after grassland burning. S. spontaneum and S. narenga had the highest and second highest fat contents, respectively, after grassland burning. Crude fibre content in S. narenga increased significantly (p < 0.05) after grassland burning, but not in the other two tall grasses. The total ash content and the acid-insoluble ash content increased significantly (p < 0.05) in post-burning samples of all five grasses. The short grasses A. compressus and C. dactylon showed the highest calcium and phosphorus contents, respectively, after grassland burning, highlighting their significance in the diets of GOH rhinos along with tall grasses with higher proximate nutrient contents, and their contribution to the improved health status of rhinos after grassland burning. This study will be helpful for improved management of rhino health and their habitats, essential to maintaining the progress made in MNP since the 2008 to 2022 GOH rhino reintroductions under the Rhino Vision 2020 initiative.

AB  - Novel host plant-insect interactions often arise from human-mediated introductions of potential hosts to areas inhabited by native insects, or invasive insects to regions with suitable hosts. These novel interactions may drive ecological and evolutionary change in native species. Here we investigate the role of the introduction of the prickly pear Opuntia ficus-indica on the demographic history of the native moth Cactoblastis cactorum. The latter became a pest in its native range after the introduction of the economically cultivated prickly pear. We evaluated potential scenarios of long-term population size changes by applying a demographic simulation framework to a large set of high-throughput sequence data. We sampled populations of the cactus moth from regions of historical incidence of prickly pear crop, in central and northwestern Argentina. To shed insight into the shared history of the exotic cactus/native moth system we integrated the historical records of the introduction of O. ficus-indica in South America into the demographic simulation. We also included a null hypothesis of stable population and/or ancient population changes. Our results reveal population size changes in both Quaternary and contemporary C. cactorum populations. Simulations pointed to a recent population expansion that coincided with the hypothesis of the introduction of the prickly pear after the arrival of Europeans in South America. The presence of the new host during the last centuries apparently prompted the expansion of C. cactorum. Overall, our results are of interest to understand the ongoing impact of introduced species and the complex ecological adjustments of native insects that occur with the introduction of new hosts.

AB  - Simple Summary Low space allowance and mixing may affect productive performance in pigs, but it is not clear whether space allowance and mixing interact with each other during the grower-finisher period. In addition, phase feeding is a good strategy used to reduce feed costs and improve feed efficiency, but it may result in nutrient limitations in suboptimal production conditions, e.g., high stress. This study investigated the effect of space allowance, mixing and phase feeding on productive performance of grower-finisher pigs. Three trials were conducted. Space allowance did not affect productive performance in any of the trials. Non-mixed pigs were 5.40 and 5.25 kg heavier than mixed pigs at 21 weeks of age in trial 1 and trial 2. Introducing a second diet with lower lysine/energy ratio from 0.95 to 0.82 g/MJ at 15-16 weeks of age reduced productive performance of pigs by 3.45 and 4.05 kg at 21 weeks of age in trial 1 and trial 2, but not in trial 3 where all pigs were mixed. In conclusion, mixing and reducing lysine/energy ratio from 0.95 to 0.82 g/MJ at 15-16 weeks of age, had a more marked impact on productive performance than a reduction in space allowance from 0.96 to 0.78 m(2)/pig. This study investigates the effects of space allowance (SA), mixing and phase feeding (PF) on performance of grower-finisher pigs. Three trials (T) were conducted. In T1 and T2, 345 pigs/trial were moved to finisher stage at 11 weeks of age and assigned to two SAs: 0.96 (n = 15 pens; 10 pigs/pen) and 0.78 (n = 15; 13 pigs/pen) m(2)/pig. Mixing was applied to 5 pens of each SA leading to a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement (SA x Mixing). For PF, 2 diets with 0.95 and 0.82 g SID Lys/MJ NE were applied to 5 pens of each SA (not mixed) leading to another 2 x 2 factorial arrangement (SA x PF). In T3, 230 pigs were moved to the grower-finisher stage at 11 weeks of age, mixed, and assigned to 4 treatments (SA x PF; n = 5 pens). Data were analyzed using general linear mixed models. SA did not affect performance (p > 0.05). Non-mixed pigs were 5.40 (T1) and 5.25 (T2) kg heavier than mixed pigs at 21 weeks of age (p < 0.001). PF reduced performance of pigs by 3.45 (T1) and 4.05 (T2) kg at 21 weeks of age (p < 0.001). In conclusion, mixing and reducing SID Lys:NE ratio from 0.95 to 0.82 g/MJ at 15-16 weeks of age, have a more marked impact on performance than reducing SA from 0.96 to 0.78 m(2)/pig.

AB  - One of the main obstacles of classical biological control is that biological control organisms cannot be recalled once they are released in nature. It is particularly true for the flowerhead weevil, Rhinocyllus conicus Frolich, which was released as a biological control organism for the invasive musk thistle, Carduus nutans L. (MT). While weevils successfully suppressed introduced populations of musk thistles and other invasive thistle species, non-target attacks have been reported on multiple native thistles including federally listed threatened and endangered (T&E) thistle species. To investigate the foraging behavior of female weevils on invasive and native thistles, we examined volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from MT and a T&E plant species, Sacramento Mountains thistle, Cirsium vinaceum Wooton & Standley (SMT) in the Lincoln National Forest, New Mexico. We used a dynamic headspace volatile collection system and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to compare volatile profiles between MT and SMT. Female weevils reacted to 7 electrophysiologically active chemical compounds in the blends based on gas chromatography-electroantennography. The behavioral response of female weevils was indifferent when VOCs from both thistles were offered in y-tube olfactometry experiments. Yet, they preferred VOCs collected from MT to purified air. The searching time of female weevils was longer to VOCs collected from SMT over controls. Investigating signals during the initial host recognition of released biological control organisms may open new opportunities to reduce non-target attacks on T&E plant species.

AB  - This paper investigates Tao (Yami) people's various engagement with pigs as social agents. How do Tao people make sense of the encounter with this non-human? Pongso no Tao, in Taiwan, is the territory of the Tao, an indigenous community belonging to the Austronesian-speaking peoples. In Tao's onto-cosmological conceptions, the entanglement between animals and humans participate in the blurring of the interspecies boundaries, making it possible to apprehend alterities as intentional beings. The flying fish may be the most respected animal on the island, however the Suidae play a key role in Tao's life too. In Pongso no Tao, raising pigs is a sign of commitment to interpersonal relationships. Therefore, offering and receiving pig meat are far from being empty gestures; they have deep social meanings and implications, especially the obligation to "return".

AB  - Biological control is an attractive option for controlling invasive plant species that are difficult to manage otherwise. However, the release of a non-native species as a biological control agent carries risks. The most obvious risk relates to impacts on plant species other than the plant species targeted for control. There are, however, also other risks. We report on a potential unintended impact of Dasineura dielsi, a gall-forming biological control agent that was released against Acacia cyclops in South Africa in 2003. We confirmed that the galls formed by D. dielsi on A. cyclops harbor mites in the genus Pyemotes (P. cf. ventricosus) within their gall structures, which are parasites of various insect species, but are also known to cause dermatitis in humans. Sporadic biting incidences have been reported in at least two locations in South Africa. The implications are that manual clearing of A. cyclops may expose humans to itch mites and to risks of bites. Gall-forming insects and fungi are known to create niches for herbivores and other gall-associated fauna. Although every possible food web interaction cannot be predicted, enough evidence exists to require that agent screening to include non-target risks other than those pertaining to non-host plants. Testing only whether agents are compromised by interactions with non-target plant species is not sufficient during agent evaluation. If such associations are known from the native range and therefore can form in the introduced range, then any known risk to health and socio-economic activities should be disclosed. We argue for the general development of objective assessment of such risks compared with the benefits potentially accruing from successful biological control of the target plant.

AB  - Species distribution models are valuable tools for conservation management. However, there remain challenges in developing and interpreting these models in the marine environment, such as the nature of the species used for the modelling process. When working with mobile species in dynamic environments, lack of observation is usually interpreted as an observation of absence, which can result in the introduction of biases by methodological (false) absences. Here, we explore the role of absences when modelling marine megafauna distributions. To better understand how the use of absences (or equivalent) affects the niche modelling algorithms, we used a set of 20 virtual species with different relations to the habitat (generalist static, specialist static, generalist dynamic and specialist dynamic) with different encounter rates. We tested six different modelling techniques divided into three distinct groups: presence-only, presence-background and presence-absence. We compared the outputs of the models using traditional validation metrics and overlap metrics in the geographical and environmental spaces. Algorithms characterized the ecological niche for the simulated species differently. Approaches using background data generally outperformed the other methods, suggesting that the non-observation of a species in a given location and time should not be considered as an absence. A very intense (practically unrealistic) sampling schema would be required to obtain a genuine unbiased absence when working with these species and habitats. For highly mobile species, a precautionary approach would be to consider the non-observation of a species as part of the background (a sample of the conditions available in the study area) rather than an absence. A good starting point would be to use presence-background models, complemented with presence-absence and/or presence-only models, comparing outputs from the different algorithms tested in the geographic and environmental space. Improving model performance for highly mobile marine species should lead to better-informed decision making for conservation.

AB  - Herbivore dung quality (physical and chemical parameters) varies between animal species and animal diet which is influenced by seasonal fluctuations and farm management practices. Subsequently, this influences the reproductive success of dung beetles. In Australian pasture systems, how the introduced dung beetle assemblage interacts in the field with cattle dung derived from different resources is unknown. This study quantifies the colonization by dung beetles (abundance, species richness and evenness) and removal of cattle dung derived from three common temperate pasture systems (improved native, forage oat and rye/clover pasture, henceforth dung type) over 24 h for 12 months. From the three dung types, 13 species of dung beetle were captured. Abundance and species richness were influenced by month and transect, with weak evidence for differences between dung types influencing overall abundance: Onthophagus binodis (49.7%), Aphodius fimetarius (24.4%) and Labarrus lividus (17.1%) were the most abundant species. Dung removal (organic matter) was influenced by month and dung type, with more dung buried in improved native (23.9 g) and rye/clover (24.7 g) derived dung compared with forage oat (12.3 g) dung. Dung beetle abundance was positively correlated with removal of all dung types, with O. binodis biomass significantly influencing dung removal. This study showed that diet of bovine animals weakly influences the abundance of a local dung beetle assemblage, warranting further investigation on the influence of other dung types in different regions. Improvements to reporting of pasture species and growth stage is recommended for comparisons between dung derived sources.

AB  - A recent review of the management of hyperabundant macropods in Australia proposed that expanded professional shooting is likely to lead to better biodiversity and animal welfare outcomes. While the tenets of this general argument are sound, it overlooks one important issue for biodiversity and animal health and welfare: reliance on toxic lead-based ammunition. Lead poisoning poses a major threat to Australia's wildlife scavengers. Current proposals to expand professional macropod shooting would see tonnes of an extremely toxic and persistent heavy metal continue to be introduced into Australian environments. This contrasts with trends in many other countries, where lead ammunition is, through legislation or voluntary programs, being phased out. Fortunately, there are alternatives to lead ammunition that could be investigated and adopted for improved macropod management. A transition to lead-free ammunition would allow the broad environmental and animal welfare goals desired from macropod management to be pursued without secondarily and unintentionally poisoning scavengers. Through this article, we hope to increase awareness of this issue and encourage discussion of this potential change.

AB  - The nature of the mechanisms that have shaped the animal communities of the island of Ireland remains a pervasive question in the study of the Quaternary of north-western Europe. Archived Quaternary faunal bone assemblages from antiquarian excavations of cave sites are a direct line of evidence with demonstrable potential to shed light on this issue, but are currently constrained by limited publication, understanding of early excavation protocols, and a lack of chronological reference. Alice and Gwendoline Cave in the west of Ireland was the subject of extensive excavations in 1902, which yielded a substantial faunal assemblage and the first evidence of an Upper Palaeolithic human presence on the island during the terminal Pleistocene. Here, we report further results from this important site. Archaeological excavations and a radiocarbon dating programme in 2019-2020 have shed light on the environmental context of the faunal assemblage, the cave taphonomy and site chronology. Nineteen radiocarbon dates are now available, including new direct dates for brown bear (Ursus arctos), giant deer (Megaloceros giganteus) and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). The archaeological excavations and the analysis of sedimentary lipids - the first of its kind for an Irish cave site, both suggest that the sediments are primarily of exogenous origin, likely carried into the cave through fissures and openings by runoff or colluvial movements. Our analyses indicate that there were at least three main 'pulses' of bone-bearing sediment accumulation: at the beginning of the Younger Dryas (c. 12,700 cal. BP), in the aftermath of the Younger Dryas (11,300 cal. BP) and in the Early Holocene (c. 10,000 cal. BP), with a hiatus in sediment deposition after 9700 cal. BP.

AB  - Pollen limitation is widespread, despite predictions that it should not be. We propose a novel mechanism generating pollen limitation: conflicting selection by pollinators and antagonists on pollinator attraction traits. We introduce a heuristic model demonstrating antagonist-induced adaptive pollen limitation and present a field study illustrating its occurrence in a wild population. For antagonist-induced adaptive pollen limitation to occur, four criteria must be met: (1) correlated attraction of pollinators and antagonists; (2) greater response by antagonists than pollinators to altered investment in attraction traits; (3) reduced investment in pollinator attraction, leading to pollen limitation; and (4) higher fitness for plants with reduced investment in pollinator attraction. We surveyed nectar robbery and reproductive output for 109 Odontonema cuspidatum (Acanthaceae) plants in a pollen-limited population over 2 years and used experimental floral arrays to evaluate how flower number affects pollination and nectar robbery. Both pollinators and nectar robbers preferred larger floral displays and nectar robbery reduced reproductive output, suggesting conflicting selection. Survey and experimental data agreed closely on the optimum flower number under antagonist-induced pollen limitation; this number was substantially overrepresented in the population. While criteria for antagonist-induced adaptive pollen limitation are restrictive, the necessary conditions may often be realized. Considering interactions beyond the plant-pollinator dyad illuminates previously overlooked mechanisms generating pollen limitation.

AB  - Body composition is an important parameter in diving animals intermittently fasting on land, such as southern elephant seals, as it is known to impact their time of departure at sea, swimming effort, foraging success, and survival. Deuterium labeled water is commonly used to assess total body water, but a precise indication of equilibration time in this species and reliable sample storage are lacking. We injected newly weaned southern elephant seal female pups with deuterium-labeled water. We thereafter blood sampled the seals several times to assess the equilibration time and body composition. We implemented two storage methods, flame-sealed capillaries and frozen serums stored at - 20 degrees C in a gas freezer. The frozen serums method was reliable as capillaries and safer to bring undamaged samples from the field. This method of determining body composition in wild animals is reliable and easily applicable for isolated and difficult-to-access fieldwork.

AB  - Background: The Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus), a subspecies of the Asian elephant, is predominantly found in India, supporting nearly 60% of the global population. In West Bengal state, particularly in the northern districts (Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, and Alipurduar) unremitting habitat destruction, encroachment, and high population densities of both humans and elephants have led to an escalation in human-elephant conflicts (HECs). Among different mitigation measures, electric fences (EFs) are commonly preferred, however, illegal usage of lethal EFs has led to increased cases of electrocution-based elephant mortalities. Aims: A study was conducted at selected HEC-prone sites in elephant habitats of the northern districts to (i) document the physical status of EFs installed, (ii) examine local community perceptions regarding the efficacy of EFs in mitigating elephant raids, and (iii) provide recommendations for the sustainable management of EFs. Methods: Firstly, secondary data (2017-2023) on elephant electrocution incidents were collected from literature, official records, and media sources from the study area. Based on this, EFs were assessed at 33 conflict-prone sites across various land-use types. Subsequently, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 166 randomly selected residents within 5 km of the fence sites to assess their perceptions regarding efficacy of EFs. Statistical analyses were executed to analyse associations between fence characteristics, land-use, and socio-demographic factors. Results: Of the 62 fences assessed, 32 were active and 14 were found to be lethal. The findings revealed non-lethal fences were more prevalent than lethal ones, indicating a growing awareness within local communities about the adverse impacts of lethal EFs. The perception-based survey revealed that 39.8% of respondents considered EFs moderately effective in mitigating conflicts. Implication for Conservation: While mass-awareness has shown promising results, policymakers are recommended to implement stricter regulations and establish region-specific monitoring squads.

AB  - Simple Summary Mongolia is home to the Bogd Khan Mountain Strictly Protected Area, a UNESCO biosphere reserve and one of the oldest protected areas in the world. This forested mountain is a sky island surrounded by steppe habitat and the rapidly growing capital city of Ulaanbaatar to the north, which has encroached on the protected area since the democratic revolution in 1991. Wolves are the top predators, but they face threats from a growing urban area, livestock grazing, and free-ranging dogs. Using camera traps, we determined the wolf abundance and activity patterns within the protected area. We also modeled wolf activity patterns and examined whether they overlapped with those of people, dogs, livestock, and natural prey. Our results showed wolves avoided humans and livestock and had high spatial and temporal overlap with native ungulates. Wolf abundance was also not determined by the proximity to urban areas. These results will help the protected area administration monitor wolves and other wildlife, as well as identify areas of concern due to the impact of free-ranging dogs.Abstract Mongolia's rapidly expanding capital is encroaching on Bogd Khan Mountain, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and the oldest protected area in Eurasia. Gray wolves (Canis lupus) in this wildland-urban interface are locally near-threatened due to hunting, local beliefs, and human-wildlife conflict. In 2022 and 2023, we deployed 72 camera traps (11,539 trap nights) to investigate how wolves respond to overlapping pressures from free-ranging dogs, livestock, and human activity. Using a random habitat-stratified camera design and abundance modeling, we assessed diel activity and spatial co-occurrence. Wolves exhibited nocturnal and crepuscular activity, with the greatest temporal overlap with wild prey (wapiti: triangle 4 = 0.73; Siberian roe deer: triangle 4 = 0.79), moderate overlap with dogs (triangle 4 = 0.60) and horses (triangle 4 = 0.68), and minimal overlap with cattle (triangle 4 = 0.40) and people (triangle 4 = 0.43). Mean wolf abundance estimates ranged from lambda = 0.91 (CI 95%, 0.05-1.77) in 2022 to lambda = 1.52 (CI 95%, 0.44-3.53) in 2023. Wolves were more abundant at higher relative abundance of wild ungulates and in areas with more people. Wolves co-occurred with dogs at 11 sites and were more abundant in areas with a higher number of dogs. Our findings highlight the complex dynamics between wildlife, livestock, and human-associated disturbances at the wildland-urban interface, underscoring the need for integrated management strategies that address both ecological and human dimensions of conservation.

AB  - Simple Summary The sika deer is a very flexible invasive species, capable of living dynamically in both large forests and mixed environment characterized by a prevalence of agricultural land. The Japanese sika deer was introduced to the Czech Republic at the end of the 19th century. The success of an introduced alien species may consist in their hybridizing with closely related taxa. Where few barriers to gene flow exist, rapid introgression of genetic traits from one species into another frequently occurs. The current Czech sika populations embody the most abundant and expanding group in continental Europe. In western Bohemia, we confirmed the interspecific hybridization with the native red deer. In this context, the red deer gene pool is endangered. The animals proliferate steadily in all directions and will most probably spread all over the Czech Republic if no major, timely changes in game management are adopted. Although inter-species hybrids between the red and sika deer can be phenotypically determined only exceptionally, there is the eventuality of identification via molecular genetic analysis. We used bi-parentally inherited microsatellite markers and a Bayesian statistical framework to re-examine the proportion of hybrids in the Czech red and sika deer populations. In total, 123 samples were collected, and the nuclear dataset consisted of 2668 allelic values. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 10 (BM1818) to 22 (BM888 and T193), yielding the mean of 16 alleles per locus across the deer. The mean allelic diversity of the red deer markedly exceeded that of the Japanese sika deer. Interspecific hybrids were detected, enabling us to confirm the genetic introgression of the sika deer into the red deer populations and vice versa in western Bohemia. The mean hybrid score equaled 10.6%, with 14.3% of the hybrids being among red deer-like individuals and 6.7% among sika-like ones. At two western Bohemian locations, namely, Doupovske hory and SlavkovskATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE les, the total percentages of hybrid animals equaled 18.8 and 8.9, respectively. No red deer alleles were detected in the sika populations of the subregions of Kladska, Zlutice, and Lany. The NeighborNet network clearly separated the seven red and sika deer sampling populations according to the geography. The knowledge gained from the evaluated data is applicable in hunting management to reduce hybridization with the European deer.

AB  - The ocean's meso- and submeso-scales (1-100 km, days to weeks) host features like filaments and eddies that have a key structuring effect on phytoplankton distribution, but that due to their ephemeral nature, are challenging to observe. This problem is exacerbated in regions with heavy cloud coverage and/or difficult access like the Southern Ocean, where observations of phytoplankton distribution by satellite are sparse, manned campaigns costly, and automated devices limited by power consumption. Here, we address this issue by considering high-resolution in-situ data from 18 bio-logging devices deployed on southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) in the Kerguelen Islands between 2018 and 2020. These devices have submesoscale-resolving capabilities of light profiles due to the high spatio-temporal frequency of the animals' dives (on average 1.1 +-0.6 km between consecutive dives, up to 60 dives per day), but observations of fluorescence are much coarser due to power constraints. Furthermore, the chlorophyll a concentrations derived from the (uncalibrated) bio-logging devices' fluorescence sensors lack a common benchmark to properly qualify the data and allow comparisons of observations. By proposing a method based on functional data analysis, we show that a reliable predictor of chlorophyll a concentration can be constructed from light profiles (14 686 in our study). The combined use of light profiles and matchups with satellite ocean-color data enable effective (1) homogenization then calibration of the bio-logging devices' fluorescence data and (2) filling of the spatial gaps in coarse-grained fluorescence sampling. The developed method improves the spatial resolution of the chlorophyll a field description from similar to 30 km to similar to 12 km. These results open the way to empirical study of the coupling between physical forcing and biological response at submesoscale in the Southern Ocean, especially useful in the context of upcoming high-resolution ocean-circulation satellite missions.

AB  - Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is produced by activated T cells and play important role in immune response against antigen. It acts in both autocrine and paracrine manner. It can stimulate B cells and various other phagocytic cells like monocytes, lymphokine-activated killer cells and natural killer cells. Acting in autocrine fashion, IL-2 protein plays a crucial role in proliferation of T cells. IL-2 triggers the release of pro and anti- inflammatory cytokines by activating several pathways. In present study, exon 1 of IL-2 gene of four local Pakistani breeds (Dera Din Panah, Beetal, Nachi and Kamori) was amplified by using reported ovine IL-2 primers. Amplified products of 4 breeds of goat were bidirectionally sequenced to decipher polymorphisms. Only a single substitution (T -> A) was found in non-coding region of IL-2 gene. Comparison of IL-2 gene sequence of all four breeds with other goat breeds showed high similarity in sequence. Phylogenetic analysis of our local breeds with other mammals showed that IL-2 was highly variable. This high substitution rate could be due to changed selective pressure. These rapid changes may also lead to the changes in the functions of immune system.

AB  - Lophodermium piceae is the most common endophyte of Norway spruce (Picea abies) needles, and it probably occurs in the total distribution area of Norway spruce. Its significance to the host tree is still largely unknown mainly because no methodology is known for generating endophyte-free saplings nor for inoculation of intact needles with this fungus. We report here how a daily heat treatment at 40 degrees C for 8 h eradicates endophytes of Norway spruce needles within a few days without causing visible harm to the plants. We compared various methods for inoculation of endophyte-free saplings. In order to obtain effective inocula, we investigated what factors activate dormant L. piceae infections in the needle tissue resulting in ascomata formation. Best inoculation success was achieved by suspending naturally shed, highly infected needles above the saplings. Infection frequencies of up to 70% of needles were achieved with repeated inoculations in the course of 3 years. Once established in needles, individual infections by L. piceae can persist for at least 5 years. Individual infections remain small in young needles, but at a needle age of 6 years, they start to grow and spread resulting in presence all over the needle from base to tip at a needle age of 7 years, but still without causing visible symptoms on the needles. The presented methodology for generating both endophyte-free and endophyte-infected saplings of Norway spruce provides a new approach for testing the significance of infections by L. piceae to insect herbivory and diseases of Norway spruce needles.

AB  - The effect of the 20th-century functional extinction of the American Chestnut (Fagaceae: Castanea dentata (Marshall) Borkh) on associated herbivorous insects is unknown. These insects include leafminers that spend at least part of their larval phase feeding between the epidermises of leaves. We surveyed leafminers on C. dentata, nonnative Castanea spp., and hybrids on Long Island, NY. We found 10 leafminer species feeding on Castanea spp. A first New York State record was documented for Stigmella castaneaefoliella (Chambers) (Lepidoptera: Nepticulidae). New host records are established for 6 lepidopterans, including a new host genus for Phyllonorycter basistrigella (Clemens) (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae). We found no significant differences in the mean intensity of S. castaneaefoliella leaf mines on native and nonnative Castanea spp.; however, our sample size was small. Thus, we guardedly conclude that nonnative Castanea spp. can serve as refugia for C. dentata leafminers native to North America while acknowledging that the extent to which nonnative species are utilized requires further investigation.

AB  - This study provides a pioneering analysis of the structural and topological characteristics of one of nature's simplest food webs, using the Montana Clara islet (Canary Islands) as a case study. Applying a multilayer network approach, which assesses multiple interaction types, we examined plant-animal and plant-fungi interactions during two seasons (humid and dry), comparing this oceanic island food web to one from Na Redona, a small continental island in the Balearic Islands. Data were collected through field observations, flower visitation records, fecal analysis, and DNA metabarcoding of root-associated fungi. The study identified 63 animal species and 367 fungal amplicon sequence variants interacting with 13 plant species, five of which (38%) were structurally significant, as indicated by high multilayer versatility values (>0.5). The network structure was modular, with 23 modules primarily representing single ecological functions, and most species were involved in only one interaction type. Notably, 73% of species shifted roles between interaction layers. Results reveal that Montana Clara's food web is simpler but more modular and versatile than that of the continental island, aligning with island biogeography theory. The study suggests that the unique biodiversity composition of oceanic islands, particularly islets, influences their ecological network structures.

AB  - Milk yield and its composition show individual variation due to the effects of the environment. Previous studies suggest that meteorological variables exert negative effects on milk yield and composition, especially during summer. This study aimed to examine the effects of meteorological variables on bulk milk composition in the Sardinian sheep production system. In this work, a total of 218,170 records belonging to 4562 dairy sheep farms were merged with the meteorological data provided by 60 meteorological stations located on Sardinia Island (Italy). Milk composition in the late spring and summer recorded during a 5-year period was used to evaluate the impact of climate exposure on bulk milk traits. The milk quality was analyzed using a linear mixed model that included the fixed effects of the year of sampling, the flock size, the temperature humidity index (THI) and the random effect of the flock. The variability of milk composition explained by flock and management ranged from 30 to 64%. The flock size exerted a significant effect on milk composition: large flocks characterized by advanced management and feeding techniques resulted in higher milk quality (e.g., higher protein and fat, lower lactose) compared to traditionally managed small flocks. The impact of THI on milk composition was statistically significant across different milk quality traits (p < 0.001); the effect of thermal stress varied according to the month of lactation. For instance, milk fat content in May increased by +0.4% for THI > 76. In June, no relevant differences were observed, whereas a decrease in fat percentage was observed in July as THI values increased (up to -0.5% for THI > 76). While somatic cell counts remained relatively stable across different conditions, total bacterial count showed greater seasonal variability, peaking during warmer periods. In addition, using factor analysis, we developed a multivariate meteorological index (MMI), which explained 51% of the variance of the original meteorological data. MMI was highly correlated with THI (r = 0.75). The same linear mixed model applied for modeling THI was used to assess the effect of MMI on milk traits. Fat, protein fractions and lactose showed significant variation across MMI classes (p-value < 0.001) in the same direction as those based on THI. Overall, our findings underscore the impact of both flock size and environmental conditions on milk quality, with heat stress and traditional versus modern management practices leading to measurable differences in milk traits.

AB  - The diets of individual animals within populations can differ, but few studies determine whether this is due to fundamental differences in preferences or capacities to eat specific foods, or to external influences such as dominance hierarchies or spatial variation in food availability. The distinction is important because different drivers of dietary specialisation are likely to have different impacts on the way in which animal populations respond to, for example, habitat modification. We used a captive feeding study to investigate the mechanisms driving individual dietary specialisation in a population of wild koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) in which individuals predominantly ate either Eucalyptus viminalis or Eucalyptus obliqua foliage. All six koalas that primarily ate E. viminalis in the wild avoided eating E. obliqua for more than 1 month in captivity. In contrast, all seven koalas that primarily ate E. obliqua could be maintained exclusively on this species in captivity, although they ate less from individual trees with higher foliar concentrations of unsubstituted B-ring flavanones (UBFs). Our results show that fundamental differences between individual animals allow some to exploit food resources that are less suitable for others. This could reduce competition for food, increase habitat carrying capacity, and is also likely to buffer the population against extinction in the face of habitat modification. The occurrence of fundamental individual specialisation within animal populations could also affect the perceived conservation value of different habitats, translocation or reintroduction success, and population dynamics. It should therefore be further investigated in other mammalian herbivore species.

AB  - The aim of this study was to elucidate the reproductive strategy of Camellia luteoflora, an endangered evergreen endemic to karst ecosystems. We observed and recorded its flowering phenology and flower-visiting insects, observed pollen morphology, determined pollen viability, and assessed stigma receptivity. The results showed that the flowering period of C. luteoflora started from early September to late December, with the average flowering period of individual flowers being 10-12 days. The pollen morphology of C. luteoflora was subprolate and prolate, with three germinal apertures and the fossulate exine ornamentation. Pollen viability was the highest at the initial opening stage (80.30%). In the process of pollen in vitro, the order of influence on the germination rate and pollen tube length was temperature > sucrose > calcium chloride (CaCl2) > boric acid (H3BO3). The best combination for the germination rate was 24 degrees C, 75 g/L sucrose, 0.2 g/L CaCl2, 0.15 g/L H3BO3, while that for the pollen tube length was 24 degrees C, 100 g/L sucrose, 0.2 g/L CaCl2, 0.25 g/L H3BO3. Stigma receptivity was the strongest at the full blooming stage. The pollen/ovule ratio (P/O) was 2240, suggesting a facultative outcrossing breeding system. The outcrossing index (OCI) was 4, suggesting that the exogamous breeding system is the cross-pollination type, partially self-compatible and insect pollinator-dependent. The flower-visiting insects included bees, weevils, and ants. In summary, C. luteoflora exhibits an extended flowering period, with a prolonged overlap of stable pollen viability and stigma receptivity, suggesting a potential strategy to cope with pollination uncertainty. However, field observations recorded only a few species of potential pollinators, while the occurrence frequency of non-pollinating insects was relatively high. It is thus hypothesized that this apparent lack of effective pollinators may act as a potential barrier to successful fertilization and natural regeneration, which might also be one of the factors contributing to its endangered status. Future studies, particularly pollinator exclusion and hand-pollination experiments, are critically needed to verify whether pollinator limitation is indeed a key factor.

AB  - Islands are exceptional field laboratories for studying biogeographical patterns, particularly those lying on the edge of neighbouring bioregions. Among island vertebrates, bats have often been underrepresented in research due to survey challenges and difficulties in assessing their occurrence. Many bat species are a priority for conservation, making it even more essential to understand their distributions and ecological needs. This study was conducted on the small Mediterranean island of Lampedusa, located at the intersection of the African and European bioregions, to assess bat diversity using an integrated approach based on non-invasive survey techniques. By coupling automatic acoustic surveys with potential roost inspections, and molecular tools for species identification from guano, we disclosed the presence of at least eight bat species on the island. Among these, we recorded the unequivocal occurrence of species mainly distributed in North Africa and whose distribution in the European territory is relatively marginal, such as Rhinolophus mehelyi, Plecotus gaisleri and Myotis punicus. Moreover, we highlight the occurrence of the Maghrebian bent-winged bat Miniopterus maghrebensis on Lampedusa, representing the first record of this north-western African species for Europe. Besides, we disclose that, on the limited territory of Lampedusa, temporary ponds and remnants of natural scrubland associated with watersheds are key drivers of species activity and diversity. Our results highlight the exceptional role of islands, and of those in the Strait of Sicily in particular, as biogeographical reservoirs, and consequently, as key areas for bat diversity conservation in Europe.

AB  - Premise: Uncarina contains 14 species of woody plants endemic to Madagascar. Its occurrence across dryland biomes on the island make it an interesting system to study the diversification of the flora. Methods: Using samples of all species and 512 nuclear loci, we reconstructed phylogenetic trees to examine species relationships and assess their monophyly. We also studied the historical biogeography of the genus and combined leaf trait data derived from SEM photography of trichomes and geometric morphometric analysis of leaf shape to better understand its diversification across dryland biomes. Results: Uncarina is monophyletic, and major clades showed a clear biogeographical signal. Leaf traits also corroborated relationships among major clades. Although most species are monophyletic, at least one cryptic species exists. Uncarina, like many arid-adapted plant lineages in Madagascar originated in the Miocene or Pleistocene. Geographic movement has been primarily along a south-north axis, with river basins apparently acting as barriers to gene flow. The evolution of leaf traits corroborated movement from the spiny thicket to the dry forest biome. Conclusions: As with Malagasy lemurs and other animals, riverine barriers may have been involved in the diversification of Uncarina and may apply more broadly to epizoochorous angiosperms of Madagascar. Leaf traits suggest either a loss of adaptations to extremely arid, high irradiance environments or a release from herbivores. As is likely needed in other Malagasy lineages, more thorough population-level sampling and specimen collecting is needed to fully understand the taxonomic and morphological diversity in the genus.

AB  - Many insect herbivores engage in apparent competition whereby two species interact through shared natural enemies. Upon insect attack, plants release volatile blends that attract natural enemies, but whether these volatiles mediate apparent competition between herbivores is not yet known. We investigate the role of volatiles that are emitted by bean plants upon infestation by Acyrthosiphon pisum aphids on the population dynamics and fitness of Sitobion avenae aphids, and on wheat phloem sap metabolites. In a field experiment, the dynamics of S. avenae aphids on wheat were studied by crossing two treatments: exposure of aphid colonies to A. pisum-induced bean volatiles and exclusion of natural enemies. Glasshouse experiments and analyses of primary metabolites in wheat phloem exudates were performed to better understand the results from the field experiment. In the field, bean volatiles did not affect S. avenae dynamics or survival when aphids were exposed to natural enemies. When protected from them, however, volatiles led to larger aphid colonies. In agreement with this observation, in glasshouse experiments, aphid-induced bean volatiles increased the survival of S. avenae aphids on wheat plants, but not on an artificial diet. This suggests that volatiles may benefit S. avenae colonies via metabolic changes in wheat plants, although we did not find any effect on wheat phloem exudate composition. We report a potential case of associational susceptibility whereby plant volatiles weaken the defences of receiving plants, thus leading to increased herbivore performance.

AB  - The Southern Ocean, its ecosystem, and inhabitants are vulnerable to climate-mediated shifts in habitat conditions. These changes can affect marine predators in the long term through changes in the distribution, density, and quality of prey. To understand how these changes affect vital rates requires longitudinal studies integrating demography and environmental states. We analyzed 22 years of capture-mark-recapture data to quantify the influence of broad-scale climate on the survival of male southern elephant seals from Macquarie Island, Tasmania, Australia. Weaning mass was incorporated as a quadratic predictor of survival to account for the known influence of maternal investment. First-year survival was greatest for weaners weighing 160 kg. Subsequent developmental stages were grouped into juvenile, subordinate, and breeding adult states to reflect the known life history of individuals. We found increased juvenile and subordinate survival with positive values of the previous years' Southern Annular Mode. This is likely due to the northward shift of westerly winds increasing productivity and prey availability in the Sub-Antarctic region. In contrast to females of this population, the Southern Oscillation Index did not affect male survival. In this highly polygynous mating system, sex-dependent differences in foraging behavior may be causing the small number of successful breeding adult males to be less susceptible to external influences after reaching the minimum age and body size required to be socially competitive for mating. These extremely large bulls will breed with multiple females and thus make a disproportionate contribution to the gene pool of the next generation. Considering the susceptibility of males to climate influences is therefore highly relevant to assessing the future adaptive capability of the species.

AB  - The term "applied ecology of fear" was recently introduced to describe the growing research field that applies the theory of the ecology of fear to manage wildlife behaviour. The management goal is to drive targeted species spatially and temporally away from areas of human interest by inducing cues from real or simulated predators to reduce human-wildlife conflict. We aimed to quantify, through a meta-analysis, if prey anti-predator response would vary among field trials versus pen-based studies, predator cue types, predator hunting style and prey feeding type, and be stronger in response to larger predators relative to the prey's size. We also explored what studies found in terms of wildlife habituation to cues. We used species belonging to the Cervidae family as a case study since deer are among the group of species with the highest degree of human-wildlife conflict. We retrieved 114 studies from online databases and collected information from 39 of those studies that fitted our research scope. We found that acoustic cues more frequently led to an anti-predator response in deer than olfactory or visual cues. Neither predator hunting strategy nor deer feeding strategy or type of study (free-ranging or pen-based animals) influenced the extent to which deer responded to cues. Deer more frequently responded to cues that belonged to a larger predator relative to their size. Habituation was reported in less than one-third of the studies, with a study period ranging from 1 to 90 days, and occurred as soon as 7 days after the start of the study on average. Our meta-analysis suggested that acoustic cues hold most potential as a tool to manage deer behaviour. These findings support the development of applied ecology of fear tools that introduce predator cues to reduce human-wildlife conflicts. Major knowledge gaps remain that limit the effective use of such tools in wildlife management and future research should focus on improving our understanding of habituation to cues, on comparing the effectiveness of different types of cues, on simultaneously using a combination of cue types, and on testing cues at spatial-temporal scales of actual land-uses.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of different farming systems and lactation stages on the physicochemical characteristics, somatic cell count (SCC), and total bacterial count (TBC) of milk from Skopelos goats. This study was conducted over two consecutive lactation periods on two commercial farms in Greece, an extensive system on Skopelos Island and an intensive system in the Attica region, involving 237 goats of shared genetic background, thereby minimizing genetic variability and strengthening the validity of the comparisons between the production systems. Higher milk yields were observed in the extensive system (0.98 vs. 0.85 kg/day), while milk from this system also had a higher protein (3.57% vs. 3.47%; p < 0.001) and casein content (2.72% vs. 2.57%; p < 0.001), which are traits favorable for cheese production. Fat content peaked during mid-lactation (4.83%; p < 0.05) and remained unaffected by the farming system. Lactose declined from early (4.74%) to late lactation (4.42%; p < 0.001). Both SCC and TBC were significantly elevated in the extensive system (p < 0.001), possibly due to hand milking, environmental exposure, and less-controlled hygiene conditions. These findings highlight a trade-off between the nutritional advantages of extensive systems and challenges related to milk hygiene. A balanced approach, optimizing both quality and sustainability, is recommended.

AB  - Artificial light can affect eyeball development and increase myopia rate. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) degrades the extracellular matrix, and induces its remodeling, while tissue inhibitor of matrix MMP-2 (TIMP-2) inhibits active MMP-2. The present study aimed to look into how refractive development and the expression of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 in the guinea pigs' remodeled sclerae are affected by artificial light with varying spectral compositions. Three weeks old guinea pigs were randomly assigned to groups exposed to five different types of light: natural light, LED light with a low color temperature, three full spectrum artificial lights, i.e. E light (continuous spectrum in the range of similar to 390-780 nm), G light (a blue peak at 450 nm and a small valley 480 nm) and F light (continuous spectrum and wavelength of 400 nm below filtered). A-scan ultrasonography was used to measure the axial lengths of their eyes, every two weeks throughout the experiment. Following twelve weeks of exposure to light, the sclerae were observed by optical and transmission electron microscopy. Immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to detect the MMP-2 and TIMP-2 protein and mRNA expression levels in the sclerae. After four, six, eight, ten, and twelve weeks of illumination, the guinea pigs in the LED and G light groups had axial lengths that were considerably longer than the animals in the natural light group while the guinea pigs in the E and F light groups had considerably shorter axial lengths than those in the LED group. Following twelve weeks of exposure to light, the expression of the scleral MMP-2 protein and mRNA were, from low to high, N group, E group, F group, G group, LED group; however, the expression of the scleral TIMP-2 protein and mRNA were, from high to low, N group, E group, F group, G group, LED group. The comparison between groups was statistically significant (p<0.01). Continuous, peaks-free or valleys-free artificial light with full-spectrum preserves remodeling of scleral extracellular matrix in guinea pigs by downregulating MMP-2 and upregulating TIMP-2, controlling eye axis elongation, and inhibiting the onset and progression of myopia.

AB  - Bone histology is a valuable tool for studying growth patterns and life history traits in animals. This study examines four Japanese sika deer (Cervus nippon) populations-mainland (Hokkaido and Chiba) and insular (Yakushima and Kerama Islands)-using femoral and tibial histology to investigate growth patterns and sexual dimorphism. Growth curves based on lines of arrested growth (LAGs) revealed slower growth rates in insular populations, supported by extensive parallel-fibered bone (PFB) development and reduced vascularity. Earlier external fundamental system (EFS) formation and epiphyseal fusion in mainland populations (three to four years) compared to insular populations (5.5 to 7.5 years) further support this finding. Sexual dimorphism was pronounced in mainland populations, with males exhibiting delayed EFS formation, epiphyseal fusion, and extensive bone remodeling than females. In contrast, the Kerama population showed no significant sex-related differences in remodeling, which may influence unique growth patterns. These findings highlight the influence of insularity, such as resource limitation and predator-free environments on life history traits, which could associate slower growth rates and delayed maturity in insular deer. This study underscores the utility of bone histology in understanding adaptive strategies of endemic and endangered mammals.

AB  - 1. Galls of some species of cynipid wasps produce a sugary secretion that attracts ants, which are thought to defend gall-inducers against natural enemies, although evidence in support of this hypothesis is mixed. Some discrepancies may be explained by the complexity of the multitrophic interactions, which involve multiple ant and parasitoid species, and which are influenced by gall size and aggregation. The gall exudate also affects these relationships, although secretion patterns and possible host plant impacts appear to be unstudied. 2. We studied Disholcaspis eldoradensis Beutenmuller (Hymenoptera:Cynipidae) galls on Quercus lobata Nee (Fagaceae) and its interactions with ants and parasitoids. We used exclusion experiments to test the defensive benefits of ants and timing of parasitoid oviposition, and we measured how gall size, aggregation, and ant visitation influence these interactions. In addition, we measured variation in sucrose secreted by galls during larval development. 3. Ants benefited gall inducers in 2018, but not 2019. Over 80% of visits observed were from invasive ants. Gall aggregation was not associated with parasitism, gall inducer success, or visitation by ants. During 2018, gall size was inversely correlated with the chance of parasitism and positively correlated with gall inducer biomass, whereas in 2019, parasitoid community composition varied with gall size. Sucrose secretion varied widely among galls and through time. 4. Facultative mutualisms between ants and sugar-secreting galls are complex and likely vary through time depending on local ecological circumstances. Gall secretions warrant increased attention and may impose a substantial burden on some host plant photosynthetic budgets.

   Aspen sapling recruitment increased as browsing by elk decreased, following the 1995-96 reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone National Park. The photos show aspen stands with various levels of recovery: (a) no young aspen exceeded 200 cm in height, an indicator of potential recruitment, (b) many young aspen exceeded 200 cm, and (c) a group of young aspen were much taller than the rest in the stand. Two different sampling methods agreed in the first two stands, but not in the third stand where growth was patchy. We address claims by Brice et al. (2021) that previous studies exaggerated recent aspen recovery. We conclude that their results actually supported previous work showing a trophic cascade benefiting aspen.image

AB  - Threatened animal taxa are often absent from most of their original habitats, meaning their ecological niche cannot be fully captured by contemporary data alone. Although DNA metabarcoding of scats and coprolites (palaeofaeces) can identify the past and present species interactions of their depositors, the usefulness of coprolites in conservation biology is untested as few endangered taxa have known coprolite records. Here, we perform multilocus metabarcoding sequencing and palynological analysis of dietary plants of >100 coprolites (estimated to date from c. 400-1900 A.D.) and > 100 frozen scats (dating c. 1950 A.D. to present) of the critically endangered, flightless, herbivorous kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), a species that disappeared from its natural range in Aotearoa-New Zealand (NZ) after the 13th C. A.D. We identify 24 orders, 56 families and 67 native plant genera unrecorded in modern kakapo diets (increases of 69, 108 and 75% respectively). We found that southern beeches (Nothofagaceae), which are important canopy-forming trees and not an important kakapo food today, dominated kakapo diets in upland (c. >900 m elevation) habitats. We also found that kakapo frequently consumed hemiparasitic mistletoes (Loranthaceae) and the holoparasitic wood rose (Dactylanthus taylorii), taxa which are nutrient rich, and now threatened by mammalian herbivory and a paucity of dispersers and pollinators. No single dataset or gene identified all taxa in our dataset, demonstrating the value of multiproxy or multigene datasets in studies of animal diets. Our results highlight how contemporary data may considerably underestimate the full dietary breadth of threatened species and demonstrate the potential value of coprolite analysis in conservation biology.
