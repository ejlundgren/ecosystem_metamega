    This data package contains vegetation cover from plots with various
    levels of herbivore exclusion on the Jornada Experimental Range
    (JER) and Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) in
    Dona Ana County, southern New Mexico, USA. Study sites were
    established in 1995; one in black grama grassland and the other in
    creosotebush shrubland to compare the impact of herbivores on
    ecosystem processes between these vegetation types. Parallel studies
    were established at the Sevilleta LTER site (New Mexico, USA) and
    Mapimi Biosphere Reserve (Durango, Mexico). Each study site is 1 km
    by 0.5 km in area. Four replicate experimental blocks were randomly
    located at the grassland study site to measure vegetation responses
    using exclusion treatments including a) all mammalian herbivores,
    including cattle, lagomorphs, and rodents, b) lagomorphs and cattle
    only, c) cattle only, and d) control accessible to all herbivores.
    Because grazing cattle are excluded from the entire creosote site,
    only three replicate experimental blocks were randomly located there
    including a) all mammalian herbivores, including lagomorphs, and
    rodents, b) lagomorphs only, and c) control accessible to all
    herbivores. Thirty-six sampling points were positioned at 5.8-meter
    intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each
    plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement
    quadrat is located at each of the 36 points. At each quadrat,
    percent cover by individual plant species is measured. Other
    measurements include height (cm) of each species in the quadrat, and
    plant condition (living or dead). Data were collected in the spring
    and fall of every year from 1995 to 2005. After 2005, sampling
    frequency changed to every 5 years in the fall. This study is
    ongoing.

    Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Four replicate
    experimental blocks were randomly located at each study site
    depending on whether the site was grazed. The blocks are all
    oriented on a site in an X/Y coordinate system, with the access road
    to each site forming the X axis. The compass orientation at the
    Jornada grassland site is to the north, and Jornada creosotebush
    site is oriented to the south. Treatments within each block include
    one unfenced control plot (Treatment: C; control); one plot fenced
    with barbed wire, hardware cloth, and poultry wire to exclude
    rodents, rabbits, and cattle (Treatment: R; rodent); one plot fenced
    only with barbed and poultry wire to exclude cattle and rabbits
    (Treatment: L; lagomorph); and one plot fenced with barbed wire to
    exclude cattle (Treatment B; bovine). Cattle exclosure plots with
    barbed wire occur only at the black grama grassland site where
    cattle were present, for a total of 4 treatment plots at each of the
    four grassland site blocks. There are only 3 treatment plots at each
    of the creosotebush site blocks because grazing is excluded from the
    entire creosotebush site. The treatments were randomly assigned to
    each of the three or four possible plots in each block
    independently, and their arrangements differ from block to block.
    Each of the plots in a replicate block is separated by 20 meters.
    Each plot measures 36 meters by 36 meters. Thirty-six sampling
    points are positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically
    located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by
    one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the
    36 points. All cover values are measured from a vegetation
    measurement frame placed over the quadrat, which is 1 meter by 1
    meter, and partitioned into a grid of 100, 10 cm by 10 cm squares.
  
          
    Fraction of canopy cover for each species present was recorded in
    increments of 0.1, to a maximum of 1.0 for each square in the
    quadrat frame. Maximum height (cm) was also recorded, by species,
    for each square. For plants, total canopy cover is measured by
    summing fractional covers, by species, for all 100 10x10 squares in
    the quadrat. Total cover values range from 0.1 to 100%. For total
    cover values less than 5%, increments of 1% were used. For cover
    values greater than 5%, estimates were made to the nearest 5%. For
    live plants, the maximum height in centimeters for that plant
    species in the quadrat is also recorded. For annuals, the highest
    part of the plant, whether it is a reproductive structure or
    vegetative structure was used. For perennials, including perennial
    grasses, the highest vegetative structure and NOT any reproductive
    structures were used. The height for bare branches is from the
    ground to the highest point if the bare branch is the highest point
    for the species. If a plant is dead, but still rooted in the soil,
    it is stated as "dead" in the condition column. For dead
    plants cover only (not height) was measured.
  
          
    From 1995 to 2005, vegetation data for all quadrats was measured
    twice a year in the spring and fall. After 2005, sampling frequency
    changed to once every 5 years in the fall. This study is ongoing.
  
          
    Field observations were recorded on micro-cassette tape recorders.
    Further details on measurements and data preparation can be found in
    the SMES vegetation quadrat protocol included with this package
    ("SMESvegquadprotocol.pdf"). A comment history is found in
    the file

          The Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program is part of a 
          national network of long-term ecological research sites funded by the US National 
          Science Foundation (NSF). The Jornada LTER program has been continuously funded
          since 1982 to develop general principles governing changes between grassland 
          and shrubland ecosystems based on long-term data collected in the Chihuahuan 
          Desert. We translate our findings to dryland ecosystems around the world, and 
          forecast the dynamics of future ecosystem states in response to changing climate 
          and land use.
        
      
      
        
          JRN LTER is funded by the National Science Foundation under award DEB 2025166.
